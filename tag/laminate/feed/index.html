Quartz is in demand because it is durable and non-porous, so there’s no place for bacteria to gather. Laminate countertops are an economical option for a minimal maintenance kitchen.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Clever design that hides mess and disorganization is another way homeowners are reducing their cleaning time. A working pantry is key. Almost 70 percent of homeowners are using pantries to store and operate small appliances leaving the main kitchen mess-free and organized. </span></p>					</div>

			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Considering laminate wood flooring for your home? The benefits abound, from costs and style to durability</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="brown-laminate-wood-flooring" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide.jpg" alt="Brown laminate wood flooring with beige bench and side stool" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-51403 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With lumber prices skyrocketing, many homeowners are rethinking their material choices for renovations. One alternative to hardwood flooring, that deserves a second look, is laminate that looks like wood. Although lumber prices are starting to drop back to normal levels, Sweeten lays out what the benefits are beyond price alone to choosing laminate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is laminate flooring?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Lamination is a process of uniting layers of material by an adhesive (or other means.) Laminate wood flooring is just that–it is three material layers pressed together, using heat, to create a strong product. The base layer of laminate flooring is wood particleboard, followed by a layer with a wood image, known as the design layer. Over top is a protective transparent wear layer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It is easy to confuse laminate wood flooring with vinyl wood flooring. The main difference is their composition: laminate is 99% wood product, and vinyl wood flooring is all plastic.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Pros and cons of laminate wood flooring</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As with everything, there are tradeoffs when choosing one material over another. However, laminate flooring has a lot going for it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">Pros:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">Less expensive than hardwoods</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Durable: kid- and pet-friendly</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Comes in many styles and color options</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Is easy to install as a DIY project</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Can last from 10 to 25 years, depending on quality, care, and amount of use</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Generally eco-friendly: Made of post-consumer wood products; no need for glues or adhesives in installation; can be removed and re-used; can be recycled </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">Cons:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">Unlike solid hardwood flooring, laminate can’t be refinished when it begins to show signs of wear</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">It&#8217;s not 100% waterproof (not recommended for kitchens, bathrooms, or over cement slabs, as in basements)</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Difficult to repair</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Features of laminate wood flooring</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring has been around for more than 40 years. Over that time, manufacturers have improved on both the product’s performance and style. Today, there seem to be endless variations of the types of laminate available. Here are some of the features to keep in mind when choosing the right kind of laminate floors for your renovation.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Style and design</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Because laminate flooring is manufactured, the sky’s the limit on styles. With advances in technology, laminate wood flooring can very closely imitate the look and feel of real hardwoods. Today’s laminate includes grooves and ridges in the texture that create a natural-looking character. Boards come in all sizes: short, long, thin, or wide-plank. Want that hand-scraped wood look? No problem. Working on a coastal look? Laminate comes in gray and white-washed stains. You can choose your look by color variation, wood species, style theme, and size.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Underlayment</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring is installed as a floating floor. As a part of proper installation, a separate underlayment is required. The <a href="https://www.builddirect.com/learning-center/flooring/laminate-flooring-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s8">type of underlayment</span></a> varies depending on the subfloor. However, some laminate wood flooring products come with attached underlayment. In this case, a separate underlayment is not necessary. Pay attention when you buy as to whether or not your planks already come with or without this feature.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Waterproof</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">No laminate wood flooring is truly waterproof; for that, look to vinyl wood flooring. Despite this, you will see laminate wood flooring on the market, advertised as being waterproof. This tends to mean it is “spillproof.” Read the warranty closely. In the case where water gets under the flooring, either due to standing water under an appliance or installation over a previous cement slab, the wood material can still be damaged.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Noise resistance</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Some laminate manufacturers market features to reduce sound transmission underfoot. This can include attached backings, or the option to pair the flooring with a specific additional underlayment pad. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Use with radiant floor heating</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Radiant heating is a type of in-floor heating system that goes below the floor covering. Just as some solid wood species are better than others for use with radiant heating, the same goes for laminate. There are laminate wood flooring products designed for use with radiant heating. Discuss with your contractor what humidity levels you need to maintain to avoid gapping between the boards. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Durability rating</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring is known for being durable. Just how durable? Check <a href="https://www.builddirect.com/learning-center/flooring/laminate-flooring-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s8">its AC rating</span></a>. Short for Abrasion Criteria, the rating ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most durable. AC1 is suitable for low-traffic areas. For residential uses, AC3 or AC4 is generally advised for high-traffic rooms.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring cost vs. hardwood</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Obviously, solid hardwood flooring comes from planks milled from real trees. And that explains why, generally speaking, solid hardwood floors cost more than laminate flooring. The price is tied to factors such as weather, the rareness of wood, <span class="s8">and export costs</span>. Conversely, laminate wood flooring costs are based on its quality and style features: thickness; durability of wear layer; and presence of underlayment.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While laminate overall is less expensive than hardwoods, high-end laminate wood may cost more per square foot than low-end hardwoods. When choosing your laminate flooring, think about your durability needs, in addition to the other features we covered. (And, keep in mind, there are other variables to consider overall <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s9">when choosing a flooring material!)</span></a></span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much does hardwood flooring cost?</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/how-much-does-flooring-cost/"><span class="s9">Forbes</span></a>, hardwood flooring costs can average from $3–$12 a square foot. Add to that $26 (or higher) for 500 square feet of the required underlayment. Labor costs for hardwood flooring installation add an extra $3–$9 a square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The type of wood you choose affects the cost. <span class="s9">For example</span>, an exotic hardwood, like Brazilian walnut, can range from $8–$14 a square foot. A softer, more plentiful wood, such as pine, averages from $3–$6 a square foot. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Adding together materials and labor averages, total hardwood flooring costs can range between $6–$21 a square foot. For perspective, costs to install real hardwood flooring in a 500-square-foot area would be between $3,000–$10,500.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much does laminate flooring cost?</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s10">Most laminate flooring comes with an interlocking tongue-and-groove system. </span><span class="s1">Being a very DIY-friendly option, it’s helpful to focus on material costs alone. Laminate flooring can be purchased for as low as $0.59 a square foot, and can range upwards of $6 a square foot. Purchasing laminate with an attached underlayment will cost you more up-front, but will save on labor later.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s11">Breaking <span class="s12">this down further, laminate</span></span><span class="s2"> with a thin wear layer is available for as low as under $1 a square foot. Medium-quality laminate ranges from $2–$4, and high-quality sells for $3–$5+ a square foot.</span></p>
<h4>How much does it cost to install laminate wood flooring?</h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">If you’d rather have a pro install your laminate wood flooring, labor costs average between $1–$3 a square foot. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Altogether with materials and labor combined, laminate floors can cost as low as $1.59 and as high as $9 a square foot. That means it would cost between $795 and $4,500 to install laminate wood flooring in a 500-square-foot area.</span></p>
<h5>Choosing laminate floors for your home</h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The advances in laminate flooring technology over the past several decades have made a once-eschewed flooring material a strong contender to hardwoods. With its lower cost, durability, eco-friendliness, and wide range of style options, more people today are happily picking laminate hardwood flooring for their homes.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I found a place that needed work and left me with some budget to renovate. It was challenging to work full-time and oversee the renovation. I tried to keep things simple. </span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The goal for my home was to feel peaceful and light, but I had a pretty tight budget for all that I wanted to accomplish. I focused on fairly humble materials for the renovation that I really liked and how to use them expanding on traditional neutral colors. Work is always visually intensive for me and I wanted a minimal, quiet space to serve as a backdrop for art and objects.</span></p>

<h3>Navigating the renovation plan</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’ve seen many projects through construction in my professional career. However, it never personally affected my life before. The biggest challenge was: would I be able to figure out the design of the space, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire a contractor</a>, and complete the work in the short window I had before I would have to move in? I ended up having to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">move into a construction site</a>. It was a lot to have workers show up every morning and not have a kitchen for many weeks. But you forget the hardships quickly once it’s done and you’re enjoying living there. Thankfully, my partner, at the time, and I were able to help each other through it. He has great taste and helped me the whole way through.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-7.jpg" alt="Brooklyn loft remodel" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44935" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-7-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-7-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’ve always liked appliance garages. It goes back to the fact that my grandparents had one in their very modern kitchen from the &#8217;60s.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-9.jpg" alt="concrete peninsula" width="1000" height="667" class="size-full wp-image-44936" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-9-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Planning a mixed-materials kitchen</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Mixing wood and laminate as finishes for the cabinetry was an important idea when I was planning the renovation. It emphasizes the volumes and makes the scale a little more human. The countertops and peninsula are concrete, which I like because the material can take any form. However, it&#8217;s also a natural material for a renovation that weathers over time.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="wood cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44939" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Renovating two bathrooms</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I was especially excited about the new bathrooms and having a tub to soak in with a smoked glass panel. From the beginning, I knew the partition would not be clear glass. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44925" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5.jpg" alt="colored shower glass" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44926" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the other bathroom, the general idea was to make a very small space feel as big and open as possible. The renovation materials are pretty simple, but the details and extra showerhead make it feel more special.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2.jpg" alt="double showerheads" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44923" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>A Murphy bed and storage</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the guest bedroom/office, the millwork is a combination of knotty pine and laminate, with a painted wood frame. The red laminate panel breaks up the finish and calls attention to the sliding door. They are both closets and shoe storage.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45036 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Matthew-Closet-Bed-22.gif" alt="renovation materials of laminate panel and Murphy bed" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I made the open shelving in the hallway myself using laminated pieces of reclaimed wood. In a way, it’s the heart of the apartment. I knew I wanted to find a spot for these shelves and the hall was just the right fit. </span><span class="s1">It turns a slice of space that wasn’t so usable into a place for display.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17.jpg" alt="custom closets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44928" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Plants were always an important component. All of the artwork is from friends and acquaintances or people in my community.</span></p>
<h3>A successful partnership with my general contractor</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractor was instrumental in completing the project and helping me do all of the things I wanted to do. At the outset, I got a lot of high bids. He was the one who convinced me it could be done within my budget. </span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I highly recommend working with design professionals. It’s easy to underestimate the amount of work involved. And don’t get too hung up on specific choices, sometimes it’s easier to just pick something nice that you know you like and move on. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Good news: You can have pretty much whatever you want, as long as you follow a few guidelines</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22170 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="Maple engineered wood flooring in IKEA kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label">Engineered wood flooring in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/rimas-ikea-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rima&#8217;s</a> kitchen</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The decisions to be made when designing a kitchen can be daunting—the sheer number alone, let alone the anxiety. Will this material work in the cook space? Will it hold up? Will I still like it in five years? Factor in a growing family and those worries begin to multiply: What if the kids drop their juice boxes; will it stain? What if my child falls&#8230;will he hurt himself?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides looks and function, you need to consider what type of traffic the flooring will experience. Is it off the garage or a deck, where dirt can be tracked in? Do you also have pets that can scratch with claws or bring water and dirt from outside? Is your child in a high chair that gets dragged around frequently in one area, or has he graduated to his own mini vehicle during playtime, adding to the wear and tear? Health is a factor, too, of course, and any flooring that is manufactured and/or has a finish should be able to provide a rating for its various contents and performance, including VOC emission and slippage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take all of these factors into account as you consider the following materials underfoot. The good news: You can install just about whatever you want, and, with a few precautions, continue to enjoy it as your family grows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hardwood</strong><br />
Sought out for its natural elegance, wood also delivers a lot: It offers a slight pliancy underfoot so items you drop are less likely to break than on a harder surface such as tile. The two basic wood options:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Solid wood</strong></span><br />
If you love solid wood, opt for prefinished floors (aka, “factory finished”) that come from the factory with a hard-wearing top coat of aluminum oxide urethane that offers protection from scratches while minimizing upkeep, like waxing; daily sweeping should do it. Ask your dealer about the warranty, which should be provided by the manufacturer and not the installer, so you have greater recourse if the floor needs a major or immediate repair. This type of floor also can be refinished, as long as the dings are not too deep. If your preference is for hardwood but you worry about those dings, take a look at “distressed” styles that can disguise any new dents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: This type of floor will fade with regular exposure to sunlight, so don’t put it by a window that ushers in strong daily outdoor sun. You also need to think about exposure to moisture—say, a leak at the dishwasher or fridge, or water constantly splashed by the sink. And if your toddler drops food by the high chair, you will want to take a precaution and put a mat underneath, to prevent spotting or stains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Engineered wood</strong></span><br />
The other option in this category is engineered wood flooring, which is made of a thin veneer of real wood attached to structural plywood. It should cost a little less than solid wood, but depending on the thickness of the veneer, you may not be able to refinish it, making it not such a thrifty choice after all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Formaldehyde, used as an adhesive, can be found in some engineered wood floors, including bamboo (see below), but at the present time this chemical is not strictly regulated, so you need to inquire with the salesperson or manufacturer with regard to any floor made with pressed wood or medium density fiberboard (MDF).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bamboo</strong><br />
Although actually a grass, bamboo is sold with hardwoods for many of the same reasons—looks natural and warm, endures light to medium wear, is easy underfoot. Most bamboo flooring is made of a bamboo veneer attached to a backing such as plywood or MDF. But you need to be mindful of quality. Bamboo gets treated with many chemicals to turn it into a material suitable for flooring so off-gassing can be a factor. Also, this relative newcomer to flooring has many manufacturing sources and quality control is not yet highly regulated. Investigate thoroughly, as with any product you bring into your home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Laminate</strong><br />
This type of flooring is similar to laminate countertops, in that it is composed of dense fiberboard topped with a photographic image of a real wood (or other material) that is then topped with a clear protective layer. With the development of HD printing, laminate offers a lot of different wood looks, and you can mix several styles (e.g., a pale oak with a colored border) to achieve some fun effects. It tends to resist light scratching and fading from sunlight. And that hollow sound that turned off many homeowners once upon a time has been eliminated by many manufacturers that incorporate underneath a sound-muffling material like cork. Laminate is installed as a “floating floor,” which means there’s no glue or nails. Boards connect by means of an interlocking tongue and groove design. Since there’s no need to connect the boards to a subfloor, they can be installed over any uneven surface as long as it’s sealed and remains dry. This makes laminate a good solution till little ones are more grown up if you want to replace it eventually with tile or real wood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Laminate wears well but like wood, it won’t withstand prolonged exposure to water, and it’s slippery when wet. Also, it can’t be refinished; if there’s damage, you’ll have to replace the entire board so order extra to have an exact match if needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Resilient</strong><br />
Mostly vinyl falls into this category, but there’s also linoleum. As the term “resilient” indicates, this flooring is easy on humans, when little ones fall or adults stand for long periods when prepping a meal, and if you drop a dish, it’s less likely to break on this surface than on tile or even wood. It also handles a lot of wear or sunlight and resists stains from food and drink spills as well as crayons and magic markers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vinyl</strong></span><br />
Recent advances in manufacturing have improved performance since the days when vinyl was for your grandmother’s laundry room. You can now find vinyl that infuses the surface with cultured diamond particles for increased protection against dents, scratches, scuffs, and stains. HD printing advancements allow you to choose a vinyl that really looks like wood or tile. Peer closely, though, and you’ll know it’s vinyl, but the faux effects can be part of its fashion-forward appeal. Vinyl remains probably your thriftiest choice, depending on the pattern.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Linoleum</strong></span><br />
Linoleum is sought for its range of saturated colors or marbled effects, resiliency, slip resistance and everyday wear. It comes in sheets, for an almost seamless appearance, as well as tiles if you want a classic checkerboard or just like that look. Made of linseed oil and other naturally sourced materials, linoleum is marketed as a “green” flooring choice, but in fact, it requires chemicals, too, to arrive at the finished product, so ask the salesperson about off-gassing and VOC ratings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Both wear well but can’t be refinished. Buy extra in case of repairs so you can match the area you need to patch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tile</strong><br />
While tile comes in both ceramic and porcelain, the latter is the harder of the two and thus more appropriate for most floors that see a lot of foot traffic. Completely resistant to fading, scratches, and moisture, tile is good for a busy household. And since it’s sealed with a fired-on glaze, it’s good if allergies are an issue, but you will want to take some precautions with youngsters in the house. Until children are old enough where toddling and falling is not an issue, use a rug in areas where little ones congregate. An expansive indoor/outdoor area rug that can be taken outside and hosed off will help protect little ones while adding a splash of colorful style. Many tiles are slip resistant since they are used in commercial areas, so ask the salesperson about this rating, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Dishware will break on this super-hard surface, and tile can crack if not installed by a pro on a perfectly smooth surface. A rug that protects little ones may have to be cleaned regularly.</p>
