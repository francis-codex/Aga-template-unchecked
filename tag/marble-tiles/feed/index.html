<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The names are similar, and the products are even quarried from the same region. Yet Carrara and Calacatta marble are so different, that you won’t ever mistake the two once you see them side-by-side. Carrara and Calacatta marble are highly valued as building products in bathrooms, kitchens, and in other areas of the home. </span>To help clarify the distinction between these two Italian marbles, Sweeten lays out the pros and cons of Carrara vs. Calacatta, and why you might choose one over the other.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Carrara vs Calacatta Marble: What are they?</span></h3>
<h4>Carrara marble</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Carrara marble is an off-white or blue-gray softly veined marble from the Apuan Alps in northwest Italy, near Carrara. Historically, Carrara marble can be seen in statues and in large public and commercial buildings. However, Carrara marble is now more commonplace in residential homes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The core, or field, of Carrara marble is light-gray, with vague bluish tones. The streaks, called veins, are light-gray, too. The veins are slightly darker than the field. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The veins found in Carrara marble are subtle, not pronounced. Instead, they are soft, watery, or feathery. Carrara marble veins seem to continue and dissipate into the field.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41699 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-14.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen sink with Carrara marble backsplash" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Tina and Andrew&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen with Carrara marble</a></span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble is a type of Carrara marble. It comes from the same overall region of Tuscany, Italy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble tends to have a white field. Usually, the whiter the field, the more expensive the marble.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The feature that distinguishes Calacatta marble is its veining. Calacatta’s veins are thick, bold, defined, and often colorful. Calacatta marble’s veins range from dark-gray and beige up to darker browns and even gold.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta has few veins, but those veins stand out in sharp contrast to the white field.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Should you choose Carrara or Calacatta marble?</span></h3>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Carrara marble</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Homeowners who desire the overall look of marble, but want a more understated look, should choose Carrara marble. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Carrara marble does an excellent job of blending into the room as a whole rather than calling attention to itself. Because Carrara takes more of a backseat, it can be used across large expanses for walls and flooring.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble is for homeowners who want to show off this unique, gorgeous stone. It’s a marble that truly looks the way marble should look.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Because Calacatta marble is all about its veins, it is well-suited to bookmatching. Bookmatching pairs two marble slabs from the same cut so that adjacent slabs mirror each other. This gives the appearance of an open book. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble’s distinctive veins make bookmatching possible. With Carrara marble, you can bookmatch slabs, but the effect may not be evident.</span></p>
<h3>Calacatta vs Carrara Cost: Which is more expensive?</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nobody can call marble a &#8220;bargain&#8221; building material. However, Carrara marble is far less expensive than Calacatta marble; around half the price.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34229 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated bathroom with Calacatta marble walls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></h3>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Pros and cons of marble</span></h3>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Pros</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Premium building material<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">High resale value<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Unique, every slab is different<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Natural building material<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Lasts long with proper maintenance<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Cons</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Expensive<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Soft, chips easily<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Heavy<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Stains<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Requires maintenance<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why is marble popular?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">All building materials have their trends. But <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/room-decorating/kitchens/a8981/cons-marble-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble’s popularity remains more stable</a> than other materials. In fact, no other material looks quite like it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For some homes, marble isn’t just the best choice, it’s the only choice. Marble is frequently the go-to pick for high-end houses with a classic or traditional style. It doesn’t hurt that marble’s history is rich and deep, as marble is associated with Roman buildings and classic sculptures.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Functionally, marble is dense, heavy, and permanent. It resists heat well. It’s also more commonly found than one might think. Italy produces Carrara and Calacatta marble, but Spain, India, China, Turkey, Greece, and the U.S. also produce other types of marble.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45056 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Image of a bathtub with Calacatta marble walls" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></h3>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Best uses of marble in the home: </span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><b></b>Kitchen counters: Use marble as your main kitchen countertop material.</li>
<li>Kitchen island counters: Pair the main kitchen counters with a slab of <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble on the kitchen island</a>. Or use marble alone here.</li>
<li>Kitchen or bathroom backsplashes: Marble works well for backsplashes in the kitchen (though not behind the stove) or behind the bathroom sink.</li>
<li>Entry or foyer hallways: Marble has long been used in foyers, lobbies, and other entry rooms as a show-stopper to welcome visitors.</li>
<li>Bathtub or shower surrounds: Marble is waterproof when sealed, making it a perfect fit for shower or bathtub wall surrounds.</li>
<li>Bathroom floor tile: Marble is a hardy floor covering for bathrooms, plus it stands up well to water.</li>
<li class="li3">Fireplace surrounds: Polished marble can be used for fireplace surrounds as it can be wiped clean.<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to clean marble and maintain it</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You should always seal marble used around the home. Keep the stone regularly sealed. When drops of water no longer bead up on the surface, it’s time to seal the stone again.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Acidic liquids can etch marble. Avoid having vinegar, citrus, or tomatoes sit on the marble for very long. Clean them up quickly. Use cutting boards.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Clean marble with gentle methods. Vacuum or sweep up crumbs or dirt. Every so often, use a damp mop or cloth. Look for a good cleaner designed just for marble. Never use abrasive powders or abrasive materials on the marble.</span></p>

<em>Guest post by Jenna, Chelsea homeowner</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We purchased our three-bedroom, two-bath home in Chelsea in 2008. At first, we painted and got rid of the popcorn ceiling but otherwise had a long, outstanding list of items to complete after our initial move in. My husband and I were expecting our first child six years later and thought: what better time to renovate a home than a few months before the baby is due! We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our contractor</a>. Upon our first meeting, it was clear that he was willing to indulge my creative side and workshop out-of-the-box ideas along the way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was eager to modernize and lighten the home. Over the years, I lost patience with the worn parquet maple floor and the mismatched color palette in the kitchen. Every surface in the home needed a facelift. And with a baby on the way, we had the very immediate challenge of creating a nursery and guest bedroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19146 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_jenna_apartment-before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19145" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" alt="sweeten_jenna_apartment-before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, we replaced the countertops, floors, cabinet doors, and backsplash. My goal was to create a soft, clean space—bringing in details like a slate floor and light gray marble backsplash to complement the natural floor tiles. I added agate and stone knobs on the cabinets and drawers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m in the process of creating a &#8220;bucket list&#8221; installation for the remaining wall, though I&#8217;m enjoying the space the empty wall creates. I went with an all-white countertop with no veins as I simply couldn’t find a slab that I was excited about in my price range. Everything, even the natural granite, looked man-made.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted to feel like I was in a luxurious hotel bathroom when I was at home, so I opted for softer lighting and intricate tile work in both bathrooms. I hate seeing soap bottles from outside a shower, so our contractor’s team embedded four shelves into the wall along the shower structure. I purchased the sink base from IKEA but had custom marble tops made and chose sconces over harsh bathroom lighting.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Gray floors are obviously in, but mostly because they substantially soften the weight of a room. In fact, it’s the first thing people notice when they see the ‘before and after’. We added taller baseboards which also add height to each room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We re-carpeted the two bedrooms on the lower level, white shag in the baby’s room as I knew lots of people would be hanging out on the floor with the baby, and white patterned carpet everywhere else. My friends with kids told me I was crazy for choosing white but so far the baby has accommodated the need to keep it clean!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The baby’s room needed to be cozy, magical, and PRACTICAL. The tree that hovers over the baby’s crib is made of the tree trunks from the four posts of the huppah at our wedding. I’ve created and commissioned a series of dream catchers that float among the branches (not over the crib!) from treasures I’ve collected all over the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was very grateful to our contractor for helping in the final details of the nursery—his team secured some elements of the changing table and helped hang some of the complicated wall hangings that I insisted on having.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The ink was barely dry on the closing papers of their new Brooklyn Heights co-op when Hari and Kaity decided they were ready to renovate a number of areas in the one-bedroom apartment, with the kitchen at the top of the list. The cramped galley space came with issues that could clearly be improved, and both Hari and Kaity also felt that their bathroom was past its prime. Here’s a look at dramatic upgrades in both spots. Check back next week for the full living room and bedroom reveal!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hari-kaitys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn-heights/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17510 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-kitchen-bathroom3.jpg" alt="hari-kitchen-bathroom3" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-kitchen-bathroom3.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-kitchen-bathroom3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-17481"></span>The kitchen in Hari and Kaity’s new place was cheery but filled with dated tile, attempts to overcompensate with bad lighting, and appliance placement that seriously cut into counter space. The windowed bathroom had great potential and had been carefully kept up, but Hari and Kaity saw opportunity for smarter storage and a chance to customize the tile with chicer selections. As first-time renovators, the couple decided to <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post their renovation project</a></strong> on Sweeten and we matched them with <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Jamal</a></strong>, who was ready to help the couple settle into a home complete with major updates in every room.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17507" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like most residents with NYC-style galley kitchens, Hari really wanted theirs to feel more open and emit more light—especially since this kitchen did not come with a window, as many do. The previous owner overcompensated by adding lighting strips to the tops and bottoms of the cabinets, but the kitchen’s layout was the real issue. Jamal got to work, designing a plan that would expose more of the room to the home’s entry and living area, relocate a key appliance, and expand storage and counter space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17518 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06-1.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17513 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17487" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jamal’s team cut into the kitchen’s entry door frame and brought the fridge a few feet outside of the kitchen’s walls, which in return allotted for more counter and cabinet space. They yanked old floor tiles and installed large, textured stone-like tiles in their place. New dove gray IKEA cabinetry with silver hardware plus a taller line of upper cabinetry, some with glass paneling, replaced the shorter set of originals. Hari and Kaity chose smooth white Caesarstone for the countertop and decided on white subway tile for the backsplash in a herringbone pattern, incorporating the classic yet modern aesthetic they were after. Under-cabinet and interior-cabinet lighting now brings a warm, inviting glow and stainless steel appliances (plus room for a brand new paneled dishwasher!) completed the turnaround.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Jamal set his sights on revamping fixtures and finishes for a more stylish and functional retreat. Hari and Kaity hoped to gain a little extra storage space, but otherwise, the upgrade would be fairly straightforward and relatively cosmetic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They chose a classic basketweave floor with marbled tiles and expanded the chic black and white look up the walls with white, undulated subway tile lined with a glossy black border. Jamal introduced a shower niche for subtle storage and replaced the old pedestal sink with a modern version that offered more room for soaps and daily necessities. Hari and Kaity kept the same mirrored medicine cabinet and pendant lighting, added a simpler set of glass shelves, and opted for a new Toto toilet.</p>
