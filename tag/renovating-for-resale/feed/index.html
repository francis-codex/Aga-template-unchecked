			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Junior accessory dwelling unit (JADU) vs. ADU: What&#8217;s the difference? Should you have one&#8230;or both?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/JADU_Guide.jpg" alt="Junior accessory dwelling unit with kitchenette" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52779" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/JADU_Guide.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/JADU_Guide-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/JADU_Guide-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ADUs, or accessory dwelling units, have been an ad-hoc housing option forever. They are also known as granny flats, laneway homes, and carriage houses. Accessory dwelling units typically solve one or two challenges for homeowners: money and family.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An ADU can help a family member, such as a senior parent or a young adult, with a decent place to live. The structure is not subject to the normal rental market of a senior-care facility or living with multiple roommates.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additionally, the budgetary bump from rental income could make living in certain properties affordable. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADU can also be an asset at the time of resale</a> if the unit is code-approved and permitted. Now, the JADU, or junior accessory dwelling unit, can be a consideration. Here, we break down what you need to know about JADUs. </span></p>
<h3><strong>What is a JADU?</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to California’s legislation, a JADU is officially designated as a separate dwelling unit of up to 500 square feet. It must have a separate entrance, distinct from the main home. An ADU, in comparison, can be up to 1500 square feet in some locales. Read about building an <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-build-a-chicago-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADU in Chicago here</a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Junior accessory dwelling units as affordable housing</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In recent years, JADUs have become more recognized and acknowledged as a benefit in places with expensive housing. They’re now built using formalized processes for their construction. In the past, it would have been a garage makeover, for example. In another trend toward affordable housing options, California has recognized the JADU. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Occupancy requirements are defined s</span><span class="s1">pecifically in the local building code. JADUs cannot be used for short-term rentals—fewer than 30 days—and one of the units must be owner-occupied. The only exception is if the owner is “a governmental agency, land trust, or housing organization.” </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Where can a JADU be built?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A JADU must be located within the walls of a proposed or existing space. You cannot put up a small shed and call it a JADU. In fact, you cannot build any new space for the JADU. The JADU can be located within a converted garage, but that will trigger a parking requirement, meaning you will have to replace any converted parking spaces on a 1:1 basis. Just adding a JADU to your existing home, however, does not trigger a parking requirement, so that’s good news.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Beyond that, the details can change in each municipality. If you’re interested in a JADU project, you’ll need to think hyper-local to ensure that you meet the requirements for permitting. Yes, that means you’ll need to meet the state code at a minimum, and then comply with the local ordinances that apply. You’ll go through a specific permitting process for this project, so an experienced professional would be an invaluable resource.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">JADU requirements and features</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One surprising bonus that makes everything easier is that the JADU may share the bathroom with the main house. Considering that plumbing and sanitation modifications are among the most complex and expensive projects, this is welcome! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kitchen space requirements are fairly reasonable. California code may be further restricted by local ordinance. A basic kitchenette is required, which will include something for cooking, a refrigerator, and a sink. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of all the requirements, the separate entrance could be tricky based on the structure and framing of the main home. In addition, getting plumbing pipes and drain pipes to the JADU space will often be the most challenging part of the whole project. But that’s where professionals shine.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Current limitations for JADUs</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some municipalities do not allow 220-volt appliances in the kitchenette, for example, so you cannot install a standard range. It appears that some municipalities don’t allow full-size refrigerators, either. In this case, the JADU will be more like a rec room than a true independent apartment, especially if the occupants share the main bathroom. There are many instances where this will not be a problem, such as for tenants who travel and use the JADU as an infrequent home base, or for a college student. A stereotypical “granny flat” may work perfectly as well for a single senior who eats dinner with you often anyway.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And considering that the minimum requirements for a JADU are so low, with just a separate entrance and a kitchenette, this option has the potential to be a fast and simple solution to needing more space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It could feel restrictive, however, when it’s time to rent the space to someone else who may want a more complete kitchen and/or a dedicated bathroom. Many people will undoubtedly feel the JADU is a compromise but at least it’s now an option.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Local ordinances for JADU: A work in progress</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another relevant benefit: you can have both an ADU and a JADU! Yes, you can technically have a sort of triplex on your property. That will certainly boost affordability! From a legal standpoint, a properly permitted JADU does require a deed restriction, which means it’s a legal part of your home property and cannot be sold separately.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re interested in this path, remember that the JADU is not simply a smaller ADU. Some requirements differ and you’ll have to nail them all to get approval. An ADU will have to have a separate bathroom, may or may not need a separate entrance, and may not have a parking requirement. There are some details to sort out, clearly. Requirements such as the separate entrance and separate bathrooms, not to mention the parking requirements, demand attention case by case. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">California’s legislation, for example, was finalized in late 2021 and some language is still being interpreted. Yes, that does mean that people can come to different conclusions about some of the language in the legislation as they work through the process month after month. Also, local ordinances will continue to crop up and result in a change in requirements and/or process. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is fine-tuning, though, on legislation that is now law, so you can proceed on a new project that helps you get the space you need! In addition to keeping good vibes with building officials, working with a skilled contractor will pay off hugely on a project like this.</span></p>

			<h2>Shortlist these kitchen renovation projects to boost your property’s resale value</h2>

<p>An outdated kitchen is not the only reason to remodel. Needing more storage space and providing a refresh after years of wear-and-tear also top the list. Luckily, doing a kitchen remodel allows homeowners to recoup costs via resale value. Whether you want to sell next year or next decade, it&#8217;s wise to plan your upgrades carefully. Here, Sweeten lays out how to boost the overall value of your home through a range of kitchen remodeling projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Kitchen remodels recoup their value</h3>
<p>A kitchen remodel has a high return on resale value because it increases the value of your home. In a<a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2021 report on Cost vs. Value</a>, 72.2% was the cost recoup value for mid-grade kitchen remodeling projects. The report also showed that a mid-grade renovation is the 3rd highest home improvement investment.</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/377222/kitchen-remodel-motivations-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Statista</a>, only about 8% of homeowners carry out kitchen renovations to improve the value. With a kitchen project, you are not only improving the look of the kitchen but, most importantly, you are improving the function and quality of life.</p>
<h3>Upgrade the kitchen through a rip-and-replace</h3>
<p>One of the most common changes to a kitchen is the upgrade of cabinetry and appliances. A rip-and-replace project includes removing old materials in the kitchen and swapping them out for newer modern ones.</p>
<p>Unlike other forms of kitchen projects, in a rip-and-replace, the walls, plumbing, or electrical elements maintain their positions. You can reface, refinish, or replace your cabinets and swap stoves, fridges, and other fixtures with newer and better models.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Changing the layout of your kitchen</h3>
<p>Whereas a rip-and-replace does not affect the position of items in your kitchen, changing the layout of the kitchen does. It focuses on maximizing the square footage, functionality, and work surfaces in your kitchen. Additionally, it involves more construction than installation.</p>
<p>With a revised layout remodel, you can install new appliances and change their old positions. This can involve moving or upgrading plumbing and/or electrical which increases the budget.</p>
<p>Moving walls by borrowing from adjacent areas or bringing down walls to create an open concept also allows for renewed functionality and more space. Also, a one-wall turned into an L-shaped layout creates more space in your kitchen, which will increase property value. According to<a href="https://www.homelight.com/blog/top-agent-insights-for-q2-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> real estate agents</a>, potential buyers usually search for bigger living spaces in their new homes.</p>
<h3>Refresh on the finishes</h3>
<p>Just as the name states, this type of kitchen renovation places the spotlight on the design and materials of your kitchen. From your countertops and backsplash tile to paint and flooring, this remodel revitalizes and optimizes the style of your kitchen.</p>
<p>If you are renovating the kitchen for personal use, customize your choices to your taste in materials, colors, and patterns. You can match your kitchen to the design in the rest of the house or switch to an edgy style. Just get creative!</p>
<p>If you plan to sell your home within five years, keep in mind kitchens are a primary decision-maker for potential home buyers. So, remodeling with more neutral colors and classic patterns will attract a range of buyers.</p>
<h3>Prepare your kitchen renovation budget</h3>
<p>A general contractor&#8217;s site inspection and cost estimate for the renovation is the best way to prepare your budget. However, there may be other issues that the construction team will uncover once demolition takes place. It is advisable to prepare for timeline changes and additions to the budget in the event of such discoveries.</p>
<p>During the first inspection for an estimate, provide the contractor with details about the house. These details should include the history, age, and other vital details about the building. With that information, the contractor can discuss worst-case scenarios based on the existing conditions of the space and how old the building is.</p>
<p>Sweeten suggests having an extra cash reserve for larger gut remodels. This contingency will give peace of mind should issues arise once walls and floors are broken into. Prepare an extra 10% or 15% to the initial budget cost if your renovation project will include extensive construction work.</p>
<p>Kitchen renovations are a great way to increase your property value. Understand the different scopes and which ones align with your budget, and you&#8217;ll be on your way to a new cook space that will give back.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Dallas.jpg" alt="Dallas home value" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>Sprawling ranches. Craftsman cottages. Stone or brick architecture reflecting French or English style. A particular Dallas home caught your eye, and location and neighborhood made it right.</p>
<p>Unless you custom-built your home, there are probably some features you’d like to change. Your home may need more efficient windows or the master bath could use extra square footage. Whether you’re planning to put your space on the market soon or in several years, it’s smart to keep in mind the potential for resale value. The clever way to approach your renovation: making it comfortable and customized to your needs, while increasing your home’s attractiveness to potential buyers. Here, Sweeten outlines some key tips if you&#8217;re remodeling a home in Dallas for resale.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>What improvements increase your home’s value?</h3>
<h4>Consider curb appeal</h4>
<p>A home’s first impression speaks volumes. What catches your eye? You may notice attractive landscaping, interesting siding, a statement-making front door.</p>
<p>Replacing the front door in a Dallas home can recoup 63.7% of the job cost, according to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/west-south-central/dallas-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value</a> report for 2020. This is based on a price of $1,803 for steel.</p>
<p>A garage door replacement fetches 62.4% of value, at a cost of $3,600. That’s based on a 16&#8242; x 7&#8242; four-section door with insulated glass windows.</p>
<p>Re-siding a home with fiber-cement is a $15,881 investment for 1,259 square feet. You’ll get a 64.7% ROI (return on investment). For the same amount in vinyl, expect to pay $13,425. (50.6% ROI)</p>
<p>Another high-value project: replacing vinyl siding on the street-facing facade with manufactured stone veneer. The cost for 300 square feet of the bottom third, including sills and outlining entry archway, is $9,276. You’ll get back 86.3%.</p>
<h4>Replace windows</h4>
<p>Sure, new windows provide aesthetics, but the main motivation is to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-to-prepare-your-home-for-extreme-heat-in-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase energy efficiency</a>. Swapping out old windows with thermal windows has an ROI of 62.4% for vinyl and 53.9% for wood. Vinyl windows cost $17,101, based on replacing 10 existing 3&#8242; x 5&#8242; double-hung windows with insulated, low-E, simulated divided lights. The same amount of aluminum-clad wood (with wood frames inside) costs $20,884.</p>
<h4>Refresh the kitchen</h4>
<p>As the hub of the home, the kitchen may be its most important room. Its function is essential for daily living, especially for families and entertaining.</p>
<p>A lower-end Dallas kitchen remodel starts around $10,000 to $15,000. A minor facelift can offer a high return of value:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Maintain the same layout (make no changes in plumbing or gas/electrical requirements)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Replace cabinet fronts with classic shaker-style wood panels</li>
<li aria-level="1">Add new hardware</li>
<li aria-level="1">Add a new sink and faucet</li>
<li aria-level="1">Change out kitchen countertops</li>
</ul>
<p>A mid-range kitchen remodel can begin at $25,000. This is based on a 200-square-foot space with 30 linear feet of cabinetry and countertops. The ROI is calculated at 69.1%.</p>
<p>Major kitchen renovations start from $40,000 and can recover 46.5% of the investment. The difference in features is the replacement of cabinetry and stone or quartz counters with an imported ceramic or glass tile backsplash. It also includes a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood, wall oven, and built-in refrigerator.</p>
<p>When updating a kitchen, consider current trends, but lean towards classic upgrades. This will assure that your kitchen has timeless appeal.</p>
<h5>Other major kitchen improvements:</h5>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Adding or expanding an island. This increases storage and creates spots for casual dining</li>
<li aria-level="1">Adding a pantry. Existing or borrowed space may be perfect for a walk-in pantry. If you don’t have space, a tall cabinet with pull-out shelves handles storage needs. Standard cabinets range in size from 12&#8243; to 36&#8243; wide.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Update a bath</h4>
<p>Working within an existing 5&#8242; x 7&#8242; footprint, for example, will be the least expensive option. You still can replace the floor with ceramic or porcelain tile. New fixtures include a 30&#8243; x 60&#8243; porcelain-on-steel tub and a single lever temperature and pressure-balanced shower control. Expect the cost for a low-end bath remodel to be between $8,000 &#8211; $15,000.</p>
<p>A more upscale remodel bumps up the square footage to around 100 square feet. Costs start at around $30,000. All fixtures are relocated, which will increase plumbing costs. Features include a double vanity with stone counter and freestanding soaker tub. A 42&#8243; x 42&#8243; shower with body spray fixtures and frameless glass enclosure also is included.</p>
<p>How you customize your bathroom depends on your wish list. You can adjust your costs according to your priorities. Do you want a rain shower? Are you looking for a special color of stone or porcelain? Or maybe you&#8217;ve had your eye on a special shower or bathtub, which can pique the interest of buyers. A sculptural freestanding tub is a special focal point that makes the room stand out.</p>
<h4>Add or remodel a powder room</h4>
<p>Do you have the space to create a powder room in the main living area? If so, this can bring more value to your home. At an average of 18 square feet, you can splurge on some creative materials, wallcovering, and even bold color.</p>
<h4>Expand your outdoor space</h4>
<p>Outdoor living spaces have become an essential part of the home. Homeowners know the importance of being able to flow easily from inside to outside. This nationwide trend is equally strong in Dallas, a city ideal for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entertaining al fresco</a>. Start by examining your available outdoor space. How can you use that space to create equivalents for how you live indoors? Seating, dining, bar and cooking areas, lounging, and spots for firepits—all are desirable features to choose from.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget about the value of flora! Landscaping can beautifully frame your outdoor living spaces while boosting curb appeal.</p>
<h4>Upgrading your outdoor deck</h4>
<p>Building a deck in Dallas out of composite material (a mix of plastic and wood product,) costs around $60 psf (per square foot) or just under $19,000 for a 16&#8242; x 20&#8242; deck. The cost for a wood deck (equivalent size, around 320 square feet) is around $40 psf or $13,000. Porcelain tiles are another attractive option. They’re freeze-proof and fade-resistant. Additionally, like composites, they require less maintenance.</p>
<p>In Dallas, wooden deck additions see a return on investment of up to 92%. Composite decks average a return of up to 60%.</p>
<p>A designated spot for a grill usually is in the plan. If you can afford the space and the extra budget, consider a mini kitchen. A built-in grill, outdoor fridge, sink, wine cooler, and even beer taps are among options available today.</p>
<p><strong>With the right help, remodeling a Dallas home for resale can be easy</strong></p>
<p>No matter what your budget is, do your homework before beginning a remodel. Some key steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather inspiration photos to identify your likes.</li>
<li>Examine your current routine. How do you use your indoor spaces? How can you use your outdoor space?</li>
<li>Weigh the costs. What do you want to splurge on? Where will you recoup resale value?</li>
<li>Connect with experienced, vetted general contractors in your area. Sweeten can help here!</li>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45208 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Atlanta-GC_Justin.jpg" alt="atlanta renovate for resale" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Atlanta-GC_Justin.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Atlanta-GC_Justin-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Atlanta-GC_Justin-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Renovation in Roswell, Georgia by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6767#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Justin</a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Atlanta housing market is humming. The value of homes increased by over seven percent in 2019, according to data from <a href="https://www.redfin.com/city/30756/GA/Atlanta/housing-market"><span class="s2">Redfin</span></a>. It’s one of those American city’s that is revitalizing with the <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2020/03/30/atlanta-population-soars-by-730-000-now.html"><span class="s2">fourth-fastest growth rate</span></a> in the nation. As a result, Atlanta homeowners are increasingly planning for home improvements. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">If you’re thinking of prepping your house for sale, Sweeten outlines the top home improvements for the Atlanta market to get the best price and sell quickly. </span><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes renovations aren’t always about what you want but what the homeowner who comes after you might want. A good idea is to take a look at the style of spec homes. “They try to use elements that have a large appeal,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6763#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Lonny</a>, who is based in Atlanta. When looking at the styles around Atlanta for your home improvements, sticking with what’s popular is best for resale rather than involving your unique preferences. “There might be hundreds of choices for faucets, but 95 percent of people might go with three styles,” said Lonny. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Renovation projects to consider: </span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Change out the front door</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First impressions endure when selling your home. “It is crucial that your entranceway is well kept,” said Lonny. Sprucing up the front of your home could be as simple as adding a new front door. For one client, Lonny swapped out a plain door for a craftsman-style door along with matching shutters. “It really set the house apart,” he said. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. A fresh coat of paint </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Atlanta-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6767#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Justin</a> advises homeowners to think like makeup artists when accessing the front of their home ahead of a sale. “You’re not going to attract buyers if the windows are fogged up and the paint is chipping,” he said. Ensuring your house is clean and your paint fresh will go a long way in getting the best price, Justin said. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Replace the garage door</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Along with your actual front door, replacing your garage door is a quick and easy fix to improve your home’s value. A garage door replacement costs $3,663 on average for the Atlanta area, according to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">report</span></a>. Your home’s value is increased by more than 76 percent of that cost. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Invest in siding</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lonny often gets calls about siding replacement from homeowners who are planning to sell their home. New siding is a great investment, according to the 2020 Cost Vs Value <span class="s2">report</span> for Atlanta. A project that installs fiber-cement siding costs an average of $17,000. Over $13,000 or 78 percent of the project’s cost is returned to you in the value that it adds to the home. That’s one of the highest returns on investment of any renovation project, according to the report. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">5. Basement as living space</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The basement is the first thing Justin looks at if a client is planning to resell their home. An unfinished basement has the potential to significantly <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-basement-turns-into-family-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase the square footage of your home</a>. “Finishing your basement is going to yield the largest return on your investment,” said Justin. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other alterations, such as a kitchen or bathroom remodel, are helpful, but they don’t add to the size of your home like a basement can. The square footage of your home and its price per square foot will feature prominently in your home’s sale listing. Depending on how many floors you have, a finished basement could almost double that square foot measurement.</span></p>
<p>A full basement renovation that includes budget-friendly floors, paint, lighting, and a half bath can start at $20,000. &#8220;<span class="s1">On the conservative side for finishes, a turn-key basement will cost around $50-65 per square foot to finish out,&#8221; said Justin. &#8220;This includes a small kitchen area and basement bathroom if all the rough-in plumbing is already installed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>A<span style="font-weight: 400;">ccording to the Cost Vs Value </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/">report</a>, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he average cost of a basement remodel in Atlanta was $70,000</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This increases a home’s value by $46,000 or more than 65 percent of the renovation’s cost, the report found.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">6. The bathroom adds value</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Giving your bathroom a makeover is an easy route to a higher house price. Recently, a real estate agent contacted Lonny with a house about to go on the market. To increase its value ahead of the sale, Lonny completed a modified gut renovation in the bathroom. “This was something that was needed because it was dated from the 1980s,” said Lonny. The customer had everything replaced except the cabinetry. The budget was about $20,000. A bathroom remodel in this budget range adds almost $13,000 —65 percent of the budget— to your home’s value, according to the Cost Vs Value <span class="s2">report</span> for Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you don’t have the time for a major remodel, then simple superficial changes might be a better option. This could mean swapping outdated fixtures like faucets for something more modern, said Lonny. A new countertop on your vanity could also spruce up your bathroom with minimum effort.  </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">7. A streamlined kitchen refresh</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kitchens are the gathering place, a focal point for any home. A kitchen could also make or break your home’s value, according to Justin. Rather than doing a full renovation that involves the costly exercise of changing a layout, stick to a scaled-back renovation. “A new countertop, backsplash, and faucet can go along way,” said Lonny. “If there’s the budget for it then I also suggest lighting and flooring.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cabinets, especially if they are custom-built, can take up a huge chunk of a budget. For a renovation that is geared towards increasing value, Lonny advised keeping cabinets as is. That way the budget and timeline can be streamlined. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A minor kitchen remodel with a budget of $23,000 has a high return on investment of 73 percent, according to the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">report</span></a>. A minor kitchen remodel in this instance involves replacing only the front of your cabinets, sink, faucet and countertops while adding an energy-efficient cooktop, oven, and refrigerator.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Give your home a fresh and neutral slate. Curb appeal gets the potential buyer to enter the door. A conservative palette inside allows them to more easily see how they can make the home their own. Take these home improvement ideas into consideration and be one step closer to closing the deal.</span></p>

Increasingly, we are seeing renovation projects aimed at resale. Whether you’re planning to put your space on the market soon or in several years, it’s smart to keep in mind the potential for resale, especially if you know you&#8217;ll outgrow your current home. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a clever way to approach your renovation: making it comfortable and customized to your needs, while increasing your home’s attractiveness to potential buyers. </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, offers an overview of the best home upgrades for resale value.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Should You Remodel for Resale?</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re moving sooner rather than later, your renovation should be strategic and targeted in the areas that will create the biggest difference to buyers with minimal cost to you. Walk around your home with your real estate agent and discuss whether there are any basic improvement projects that might facilitate a quick sale for top dollar. While decluttering and staging should be the first steps, some homes do need some extra work. If yours falls into this category, <b>ask yourself the following questions:</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Am I willing to accept a lower price per square foot to compensate for the condition of the home?</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Am I scared off by the hassle of a renovation project?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If your answer to both questions is no, it sounds like a renovation might be in your future!</p>
<h3>Renovating for resale: Apartments</h3>
<p>If you live in an apartment, there is usually another entity—a co-op or condo board—in conjunction with a management company, who is responsible for the upkeep of the building systems and its exterior, as well as any landscaping. Neither you nor the buyer of your apartment will need to deal with these issues personally (unless you’re on the board, but that’s a whole different story.) As an owner, you’re responsible for “walls-in,” so it makes sense to focus on cosmetic improvements that will help your apartment show better.</p>
<h3>Renovating for resale: Houses</h3>
<p>The priorities are different when renovating a house for resale. Since homeowners are responsible for the whole building and the lot on which the house sits, there will likely be more pressing concerns beyond the color of the bedroom walls. (Also, buyers of townhouses generally expect to do some work on their new homes after closing.) This means that your money shouldn’t go to renovations but to repairs: ensuring that all systems are in good working order, that there are no structural issues, and that nothing on the exterior needs immediate attention.</p>
<p>You’ll generally have to dig deeper into your pockets to fund these types of projects, but it’s likely that your house will sit on the market if you don’t address them. If you don’t deal with pressing repairs, and they come up during inspection, expect the buyer to ask for credits at closing in order to compensate for them.</p>
<h3><span class="s1">The best interior </span><span class="s1">home upgrades for </span><span class="s1">resale value</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A tip: Focus your time and money on remodeling the most visible parts of your home. This approach tends to bring the best value (we’ll address exterior updates further down.) These are the interior, whole-room projects that recoup the most home resale value according to <i>Remodeling’</i>s 2020 <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value Report</span></a>:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range, minor kitchen remodel that costs $23,452 has a resale value of $18,206 and recoups <b>77%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range, major kitchen remodel that costs $68,490 has a resale value of $40,127 and recoups <b>58%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range bathroom remodel that costs $21,377 has a resale value of $13,688 and recoups<b> 64%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">An upscale bathroom remodel that costs $67,106 has a resale value of $37,995 and recoups <b>56%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range bathroom addition that costs $49,598 has a resale value of $26,807 and recoups<b> 54%</b></span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Small </span><span class="s1">home resale upgrades</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Add a fresh coat of paint. </b>Especially if the current colors are very bright or unusual. You might love lime green, but it’s safe to say that many buyers won’t. Many homeowners can repaint themselves, but sometimes, it’s worth calling in the pros.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Change out kitchen cabinet fronts.</b> You can do this in a few different ways—simply sanding and repainting the existing surface is the most budget-friendly, or you can choose to replace the doors and hardware while leaving the interior boxes in place. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Swap out your fixtures.</b>  If your lighting and plumbing fixtures look like they are from the ’80s—and not in a good way—consider switching them out. You don’t need to go high-end; there are plenty of good-looking options at big box stores. Our suggestion? Pick something with clean lines and classic finishes. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Refinish your floors.</b> If they are scratched, peeling, or look damaged, this is a must. Any sign of water damage, for example, is not only an aesthetic problem but is also an indicator to buyers that there may be a history of leaks in the building. And if you have carpets…this is a huge turnoff for many buyers, so consider replacing them.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Rip out outdated trends that serve no function</b>. This applies to vinyl faux-wood paneling, weird glass block walls, and “decorative” room dividers that are now just eyesores.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Single-space </span><span class="s1">home upgrades</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Kitchen updates.</b> This is an important room for buyers and is often immediately visible upon entering an apartment, so you’ll want to focus your attention here. In addition to refurbishing the cabinet doors, replace the hardware and fixtures. You can also go further and replace the countertops and backsplash. Visually, these make the biggest impact. If you have a very dark kitchen, going lighter will appeal to buyers.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Bathroom updates. </b>After the kitchen, this is the most important space in an apartment. Particularly if there is just one—it’s important to make it look functional and clean. The easiest and most affordable ways to update the bath are to paint and change out the medicine cabinet mirror for an updated model. Updating the tile, vanity, and reglazing the tub will also be good ways to freshen up the space.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>“Flex space” addition</b>. While it’s impossible to add actual square footage to an apartment (unless you’re <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/"><span class="s2">combining apartments</span></a>), it’s often helpful to add the idea of one. This can be done by putting up pressurized walls to carve out an office nook, or by adding <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/putting-walls-multifunctional-spaces-privacy/"><span class="s2">sliding doors </span></a>across a large living room to create a den space. While this type of renovation won’t change the legal designation of the number of bedrooms in your unit, it helps buyers envision more uses for the space.</span></li>

<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">An upscale garage door replacement that costs $3,695 has a resale value of $3,491 and recoups <b>94%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Replacing vinyl siding with mid-range manufactured stone veneer costs on average $9,357 has a resale value of $8,943 and recoups <b>95%</b></span></li>

<h4>Curb appeal project ideas</h4>
<p>Curb appeal catches the eye of prospective buyers. Consider these exterior ideas to boost a home&#8217;s resale value:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Repair the driveway<b> $1,000-$5,000</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Spruce up the house number <b>$10-$100</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Invest in landscaping <b>$200-$2,000</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Repaint the exterior<b> $5,000-$15,000</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Remember: </b>In highly localized markets, like metropolitan cities, it’s important to make decisions in consultation with your real estate agent. What works in one neighborhood might not work in another. They will be the best person to guide you on where it makes sense to invest in a renovation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Keep in mind you don’t need to spend a lot of money to upgrade your home. Weigh the financial and time costs, and consider whether you’d take a lower purchase price to save yourself the trouble. And remember, it’s not about recouping the exact value of the renovation in the sale price, but getting buyers to make offers in the first place!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The importance of curb appeal renovations? Homeowners can add value <em>and</em> make an impression, with basic landscaping to prepping the roof.</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33007 size-chrono" title="exterior-large-brown-white-house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-723x406.jpg" alt="exterior of large brown and white house with sloping roof" width="723" height="406" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-723x406.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-300x168.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-600x337.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Landscape/curb appeal project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten landscape designer Michelle</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners who put their house on the market want it to be shown in the best light, and nowhere is this more important than with its exterior. Curb appeal provides the critical first impression to prospective buyers, creating the desire to step inside and see more—or to keep on driving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another advantage to strong curb appeal is that it makes for a pretty picture. Most house hunters start the process by looking at homes online and the first photo from the street can help draw buyers in and entice them to reach out to their realtor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deciding to improve the home&#8217;s exterior at resale is really a balancing act. Perhaps the first question to ask is: why do anything? It&#8217;s a valid question in a hot seller&#8217;s market where houses go on sale on Monday and are in contract by the next weekend. But an improvement can also keep negative impressions out of a buyer&#8217;s mind. Few people are wowed by a nice roof, but everyone can notice missing shingles, discoloration, and other signs of disrepair. Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, outlines the best areas for sellers to focus on for the best return on their budget.</p>
<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Consider the home buyer&#8217;s POV</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Curb appeal involves many different elements, from a well-manicured lawn to an eye-popping entryway to a new roof or siding. Deciding which projects to tackle comes down to what needs to be renovated or at least improved—if something is worn or damaged, it should be replaced or fixed—and based on the budget, what the improvement can add to the resale value of the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Check around the neighborhood to see what is most prevalent with other homes,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a>. &#8220;You want your home to fit in with the culture of the surrounding area. For example, you don&#8217;t want to install vinyl siding in a neighborhood with homes that are predominantly stucco or brick because people who are searching that particular neighborhood are looking for that specific look.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33009 size-chrono" title="brownstone" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front-723x542.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="542" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Landscaping project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten landscape designer Brook</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another obstacle is how homeowners perceive their home. Someone who has lived in the house happily for a number of years may not be aware of its flaws. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to get an opinion from someone else,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle, a contractor with Sweeten</a>. &#8220;Some of my clients call me and say they are looking to sell their house and wonder what they should do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with a qualified general contractor not only gives you the benefit of their expertise, but they can refer you to tradespeople they have worked with and trust—a valuable resource when trying to find a good contractor.</p>
<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Don&#8217;t overlook l</strong><strong>andscaping</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Improving the look of the landscape may be the easiest and least expensive way to enhance curb appeal. &#8220;The landscaping and its health are very important as a well-manicured lot will naturally draw attention to the home. It contributes to the overall look and feel of the place,&#8221; said Majid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Start by making sure the lawn is neatly trimmed and the planting beds have a fresh layer of mulch. Add color and texture by placing seasonal plants in pots around the entry. Ringing trees with mulch will give a kempt look to the yard. While this may sound simple, such attention to detail or hiring a landscape designer to do the work provides your front yard the professional polish it needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33008 size-chrono" title="house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-01-723x407.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="407" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Landscape project by Sweeten landscape designer Michelle</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a fence, give it a fresh coat of paint, whether it is a picket fence in the suburbs or an ironwork fence in the city. Its square footage measurement will determine the cost, as well as what shape it is in. “More labor is required if the fence is in bad condition,” explained Kyle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other more involved and expensive projects include adding a new front walkway or redoing the driveway, a key detail. Kyle said, &#8220;If the driveway is all beat up, the buyer is thinking, &#8216;I am going to have to replace it.'&#8221; The cost of renovating a walkway is also based on the square footage. This is the same for driveways except the cost is measured over the “blacktop, concrete and pavers. Another aspect that plays a part in the price is the elevation,” he said.</p>
<h3><strong>Remodeling and resale highlights</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both the <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Association of Realtors&#8217;</a> 2017 Remodeling Impact Report and <em><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remodeling</a></em>&#8216;s 2018 Cost vs. Value Report survey their audiences to estimate how common improvements affect resale value. Much of the data is based on the opinions of the professionals who were given descriptions of the project. The groups used different methodologies and the results do not perfectly align; however, the results extrapolated below could prove helpful for a homeowner making a renovation decision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Smaller-scale projects run the gamut from a fresh coat of paint on the front door to replacing the entry and garage doors. Larger improvements include repairing the roof to pass inspection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33103 size-chrono" title="Cost of Remodeling Projects for Curb Appeal vs Value Retained at Resale" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1000-Project-Graph-10a-723x815.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="815" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Entry door replacements</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entry door replacements range from installing a steel door at a cost of about $1,400 to $1,700 to a fiberglass door that can cost as much as $9,000. A custom door for a 100-plus-year-old brownstone will be priced higher. In general, installing a steel door will recoup a higher percentage of the original cost, mainly due to the lower upfront cost. But the location also plays a role. In New York, a fiberglass door fetches 90 percent of the original cost, while the national average is 68 percent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, very few projects actually earn back more money than they cost but keep in mind the goal is to bring foot traffic and potential buyers to your door. The exception: garage doors. The National Association of Realtors ranked replacing a garage door third among its eight projects surveyed that earn back their full cost. (A new roof was #1, followed by new vinyl windows). The report also stated that 24 percent of the realtors surveyed suggested to sellers that they replace the garage door, but only 3 percent cited that factor closed the deal with a buyer. On the bright side, the improvement added more than the cost of the project to the value of the home in the New York area.</p>
<h4>Roofing, siding, windows</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Roofing, siding, and windows are big-ticket undertakings that can cost $10,000 to $30,000 and projects that homeowners should consider carefully. Thirty-two percent of the realtors said that a new roof helped close a sale. &#8220;Roofing is important because the home inspector looks at it carefully,&#8221; said Kyle. The inspector will estimate the age and evaluate the condition of the shingles. New siding and windows helped close deals in the single digits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32965 size-chrono" title="house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2-723x482.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Renovation by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Bud</a></p>
<h4><strong>Making a decision on your curb appeal renovations</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What&#8217;s the timetable? If you plan on moving in the future, then a major improvement may be ideal because you can enjoy it while you are still in the house. Then there is the budget and the many things to consider here: the cost of the project, what it adds to the value of the house, the seller&#8217;s equity in the house, and how long will you get to enjoy the improvement before you move.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The last thing you want to do is have your home stick out like a sore thumb,&#8221; said Majid. &#8220;Overall, your safest bet as far as resale value is concerned is to stick with the general look of the neighborhood and neighboring homes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Want to achieve that “welcome factor” you need for a successful resale? Assess the condition of your home—whether its a series of small projects to larger-scale mends—and make a list.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Renovating for resale in Brooklyn: a kitchen and bath remodel enjoyed by current &amp; future homeowners</h2>
<h2><i style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heather and Doug&#8217;s 1980s South Slope condo was in need of an update, but given the family’s eventual plans to move, they kept putting off a renovation. When DIY fixes (also known as “tape”) were no longer enough, it became clear that finally renovating for future resale was the way to go. The end result? A sunny, modern kitchen &amp; bath renovation that the family knows will bring resale value—and that they get to enjoy in the present. </span></i><i style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read on for Heather’s take on major changes in two key spaces.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/all-eyes-on-resale-for-this-kitchen-and-bath-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-19324 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/heather-kitchen.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/heather-kitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/heather-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Heather, South Park Slope homeowner</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My husband, Doug, and I moved into our small condo in South Park Slope shortly after our daughter was born six years ago. The building had been abandoned in the 1970s and then turned into eight small condo units in the 1980s. We love the community, the location, and many things about our space, but the kitchen and bathroom had clearly not been updated since the original condo conversion. With our son, Elijah, and daughter, Alice, now sharing a bedroom, we knew that we would eventually need one more room, so we didn’t see any reason to renovate. But then the cupboards and the appliances began to give out. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I work at a book publishing company and telecommute, so I spend a lot of time working at the kitchen table and dreamed about ripping out our old kitchen cupboards. After one too many times reapplying duct tape to the fridge shelves and silverware drawer, we decided to take the plunge and renovate.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I loved reading the Sweeten renovation blogs and seeing the amazing transformation of other people’s homes. We had some recommendations for contractors from friends, but weren’t sure about the fit. So we </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">p</a><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">osted our project</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten and started to talk to contractors. What led us to choose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was his experience in renovating for resale. We were able to see some units that he was renovating in progress, and he had great suggestions for things to focus on for a possible sale in the future (like a dual showerhead, </span>which is really great for families with kids).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided on a classic, mostly white approach for the kitchen. Our plan was to add color with paint only, which would be easier for the next owners to change. With no edits to the layout or plumbing, we focused on choosing the materials that would make the most sense. We decided on Shaker-style cupboards from Home Depot and classic white subway tile for the kitchen backsplash from Nemo tile. Our counters are Caesarstone (from Appia Marble), the fridge is Samsung (from Home Depot), and the range is a Viking (from AJ Madison).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best changes was a little one: Previously, the stove was directly next to the sink. We added space between the sink and stove—having a place to rest a pot or put dirty plates out of view from people in the living room is very nice.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bathroom, we continued with the same subway tile from the kitchen for the walls, but veered from the “classic” plan on the floor tile. I loved the blue tile from Nemo and the idea of having a bright color in a classic herringbone pattern. No one was sure about this when we opened the box of tiles, but it is now our (and Lem’s) favorite part of the bathroom renovation. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given our short time frame, we ended up having to make many decisions quickly. But this made some of our choices less overwhelming. Instead of having 2,000 tubs to choose from, we would look at what was in stock (only 800!). While we spent quite a bit of time at big box stores and online, we also became acquainted with a few very helpful local places in our neighborhood that we will certainly go to again. I would encourage others doing a renovation to try to get a schedule of when cupboards, appliances, etc. will be needed (if not dates, then at what point in the process) because once you are</span> into the project, there is very little time to make decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since our apartment was too small to live in with a renovation underway, we planned to move out for five weeks over the summer to accommodate the work. Everything went fairly smoothly, and Lem made sure that the apartment was ready for us to move back into on schedule. Given how small and close-knit our building is, I was very concerned about the renovation being disruptive for our neighbors. Lem took great care to cover the floor and other parts of the apartment so the noise wasn’t too much for our downstairs neighbors, and so that dust didn’t invade other parts of our apartment. All of the workers were respectful of our space, the building, and our neighbors, which meant a lot to us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few add-on items that we chose not to do because we didn&#8217;t want to spend more money. One was having all of the outlets changed to new, stainless steel ones with USB ports. I plan to do this myself but wonder when that is going to happen. It probably would have been worth it to go ahead. The other was to have our floors redone. It seemed like too much to manage at the time, but now that the kitchen and bath look so nice, I notice how other parts of the apartment look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We LOVE our renovated space. The kitchen not only looks better, but it is infinitely easier to use and we have more storage space. It is amazing to have a real size fridge. The bathroom is also much more functional and looks bright and clean (even when it is not totally). Our old appliances in both the kitchen and the bathroom were energy intensive, and it was important to me to get an energy-efficient fridge and a low-flow toilet. They are little things in the bigger picture, but make me feel a little bit better about our environmental footprint.</p>
