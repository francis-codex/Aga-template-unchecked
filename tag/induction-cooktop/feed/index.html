<h3>Ceramic glass <a href="https://www.subzero-wolf.com/wolf/cooktops-and-rangetops/induction-cooktops/30-inch-contemporary-induction-cooktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">induction cooktop</a> from Wolf</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How do you like to cook? Do you like to prepare gourmet meals? Do you entertain frequently? Are you in a hurry to get dinner on the table? If your answer is yes to any of these questions, you might want to check out one of the hottest “new” entries into home cooking today: the induction cooktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While this type of cooking was first introduced to the U.S. about 70 years ago, it is enjoying a surge in popularity, thanks to a couple of factors. A growing demand for this appliance has lowered prices. You can find some models for under $1,000, or as much as a third of what they once cost. The smooth cooking surface answers the demands of another trend: a sleek, uncluttered kitchen. Finally, the precision and speed of induction cooking draws Americans who are increasingly strapped for time at home and welcome the opportunity to cut even minutes from meal prep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, unpacks the many features of induction to help you better understand what’s available and noteworthy.</p>
<h3>What is induction?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Induction is a method of producing heat for cooking. It works by creating an interaction between a metal pot or pan and an electromagnetic field below the tempered glass surface of the cooktop to heat the cookware. Induction is the only method that directly uses the cookware as a part of the cooking system.</p>
<h3>How does induction work?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beneath the surface—ceramic or tempered glass—of an induction cooktop rests an induction coil. When the coil is activated (by turning on its control knob or pad), an electrical current passes through this coil, creating an electromagnetic field of energy. Upon contact with that field, the iron molecules in the pan begin to vibrate. It is the friction between those molecules that heats the cookware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cooktop surface itself does not emit heat. Rather, heat is produced only when it is turned on and a pan makes contact with the cooktop surface. Once the pan is removed from the cooktop, the magnetic connection is broken and heat is no longer generated. Before the pan makes contact, the cooktop surface, even when it’s been turned on, will remain cool. After the pan is removed from the cooktop, the surface will be warm, but not hot to the touch.</p>
<h3>How does induction differ from other heating sources?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike gas or radiant <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cooktops</a>, there is no exposed flame or coil. If you turn on an induction cooktop, it generates no heat until the appropriate cookware is placed in contact with it. Also, the heat is contained within the circumference of the pan or cooktop. As a result, less energy is generated and wasted because the heat is created only within the pan, and not in the surrounding environment.</p>
<h3>Are there distinct benefits?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, all cooktops are not alike. While any heat source will cook food, and cook it well, induction does have standout features that include:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Safety</b></span> &#8211; The heat happens in the pan, so there’s no danger of accidentally touching a hot cooktop. This is a particular benefit to homes with children or elderly family members.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Accuracy</b></span> &#8211; Precision control at very low or high heat lets the cooktop maintain a temperature to melt chocolate, simmer a cream sauce, or boil pasta water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Speed</b></span> &#8211; The electromagnetic field below the glass cooktop surface quickly generates heat directly to the pan, so water boils faster—manufacturers claim a quart of water boils in less than two minutes—than with gas or radiant heat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Energy efficiency</b></span> &#8211; Heat occurs only within the pan where it makes contact with the cooktop, so there’s no energy wasted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Easy cleaning</b></span> &#8211; A smooth, continuous surface means no crannies where food can catch, and because most of the cooktop stays cool when you’re cooking, spills don’t burn on.</p>
<h3>What else is noteworthy?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The unique cooking function—that electromagnetic field—lends itself to lots of interesting options. For instance, most manufacturers make cooktops with multiple cooking zones that can be bridged to create larger zones for, say, a roasting pan or a Dutch oven. Gaggenau’s induction cooktop makes possible the free positioning of cookware within its combined cooking areas. Thermador offers a memory feature that transfers power settings to another cooking area when the pot is relocated. BlueStar, in addition to a warming burner at 150 degrees, has a Power Boost feature—a 5,500-watt burner that claims to bring one gallon of water in a large pot to a rolling boil in only three and half minutes. Previously, induction wasn’t so good for wok cooking because the coil element couldn’t make contact with enough of the wok’s raised surface. Jenn-Air makes an induction wok module for just that purpose.</p>
<h3>What about installation or replacement?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Induction cooktops are made to the same dimensions as comparable gas or radiant cooktops—24, 30, 36, and 48 inches. So you can replace your existing cooktop with an induction version of the same dimensions as long as you have an electrical hookup of the same voltage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you wish to install an induction cooktop over a wall oven, it’s best done with both appliances from the same manufacturer. However, you will want to consult with your contractor and review the installation instructions to make sure they are compatible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most manufacturers that make induction cooktops will also offer ranges with the induction cooktop option.</p>
<h3>Is special cookware required?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Induction cooking requires ferromagnetic cookware or pots and pans with an iron core, which allows the transfer of energy to the pan. Your cast iron pieces and most stainless steel should work fine. Hold a magnet to the bottom of the pan; if it sticks, it will work. Glass and other non-metallic items will not, however, since they lack the iron core and will need to be replaced if you opt-in for this type of cooktop.</p>
<h3>How about care and maintenance?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the unused areas of an induction cooktop remain cool while you are cooking, most spills and splatters will not cook onto the surface. The exception can be foods with sugar content, such as sauces or sweet potatoes. It’s sensible to wipe up any spills quickly with a sponge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The smooth, continuous surface makes it easy to maintain and keep it looking new—far easier than a gas model with its contours and grates, or radiant, unless it is topped with tempered glass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Only use a cleaner made for your cooktop. A regular glass cleaner with ammonia will mar the surface. Also, always lift a pot when you transfer it; never slide cookware, as this can scratch the cooktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of these features add up to lots of choice for the home cook. With so much selection and specialization, where do you begin? When shopping for induction, ask for demonstrations. Many showrooms offer cooking classes so you can try your hand at induction cooking. After all, who doesn’t want a little romance before making a commitment?</p>

</a>Guest post by Nancy in her Upper East Side studio apartment</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Nancy&#8217;s first New York City apartment was a long time in the making—35 years to be exact. She searched for a dream home in Manhattan where she could apply the movie set design playing in her mind, but none of the spaces felt right. So Nancy, who works in human resources, took matters into her own hands and purchased a 550-square-foot studio apartment on the Upper East Side that hadn&#8217;t been touched since the &#8217;60s. Everything required an overhaul! To bring her vision to life, she made smart sacrifices in her narrow 6-foot-wide kitchen, turned a closet into a walk-in dressing room, and used wallpaper to carve out separate areas. You&#8217;ll want to read Nancy&#8217;s renovation journey.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I&#8217;ve lived in the city my whole life and have spent the last 35 years mentally cataloging my favorite buildings, blocks, and parts of the city. When I decided to buy my first place a few years ago, I was living in Chelsea—and loved it—but knew I need to shift my search further uptown to get more for my budget. I had always gravitated towards the Upper East Side and gone to open houses on and off over the years. If there&#8217;s an elevator, doorman building without in-window air conditioning units (my only real deal-breaker) in the East 70s, I&#8217;ve probably been there at some point. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The first apartment I saw on my search was in the same line I’m currently living in but on a lower floor. The apartment had been redone in a style that was fine but not my own, and the alcove was turned into a narrow bedroom cut off from heat and air conditioning. </span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Fast forward a few months and I&#8217;d been turned off by so many similar “I could live with it, I guess” renovations that I was determined to buy a place that would require a lot of work, knowing I might need to sacrifice space for the ability to make my place my own. I had loved the location, building, and low maintenance costs of that first place I&#8217;d seen months ago and found a studio apartment on StreetEasy that hadn&#8217;t been touched since the &#8217;60s, except for some new appliances–score! An offer was made, and I set out to renovate before moving in. I was excited that EVERYTHING required a refresh. My apartment is a decent-sized alcove studio—about 550 square feet—in a postwar Upper East Side high-rise. Since moving in, I&#8217;ve welcomed a fluffy new roommate named Hudson, who enjoys spending his days on the couch. We&#8217;re still working on getting him to embrace his dog bed.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I had heard about Sweeten from a few places—</span><span class="s1"><i>New York </i></span><span class="s1">magazine, Curbed, and even from a colleague who knew the founder—so it was the first place I turned to when looking for a contractor. I met with a few matches and had a ton of questions. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*What would this cost (or rather, can I do all this with what I want to spend)? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*How long would it take? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*How easy is it to get all my plans approved by my co-op board and the city? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I&#8217;d been dreaming of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1847" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this project</a> since I first discovered HGTV and had a pretty clear vision of what I had in mind: </span><span class="s1">a light and airy space&#8230;a dreamy beach house vibe that a character in a Nancy Meyers movie was tragically forced to squeeze into a tiny New York studio apartment (the “It’s Complicated” kitchen will have to wait). </span><span class="s1"> That said, I knew I needed a lot of help executing that vision and managing all of the pieces of a renovation that don&#8217;t find their way onto a Pinterest board. My Sweeten contractor was great at figuring out the best way to rewire the space, upgrade the electric panel, add in a ceiling light in the living space, inject new life to the parquet floors, and bring the plumbing up to standard.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">My contractor and I spent a ton of time playing with the footprint. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Should we close off the alcove?  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Turn the small linen closet into a new entrance for a dressing room/bathroom?  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Open up the kitchen and wrap the cabinets into the living space? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Expand both the closets into a small extra room and move the living space to the windows?  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Ultimately, we decided to keep the footprint as-is, but widen the kitchen entrance that led into the living space, reconfigure the walk-in closet to be more user-friendly with french doors, and turn the cramped sleeping area closets into an open dressing room. I was always excited about the storage in the apartment, but now it&#8217;s much more efficient. Everything is put away in its own place and the storage blends into the look of the space.  </span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The other big question was the kitchen layout. I dragged my mom—fresh off two of her own major kitchen renovations—to IKEA on multiple occasions to work out a footprint that would achieve two things in the small space: provide as much drawer storage as possible and add a dishwasher. After one particularly insane mock-up where I had almost convinced myself I could turn the 6-foot-wide space into a galley kitchen with a dishwasher drawer stacked over an oven (must have been Swedish meatball-induced temporary insanity), we realized <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom cabinets</a> were the way to go. Surprisingly, Home Depot came through with their Innermost collection where each piece could be semi-customized to bring the cabinets to the ceiling and turn a corner into usable space. I love that I was able to fit a shallow utensil drawer below the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">induction cooktop</a>. Choosing to forego the standard oven range was probably my most &#8216;controversial&#8217; decision—I really wanted that dishwasher—but I&#8217;ve come to love the induction top that fits into the countertop. The combo microwave/convection oven is perfect for my needs—it cooks just as well as most of the tiny apartment ovens and frees up a ton of space.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The rest of the decisions were mostly a balance between putting my stamp on the place and keeping resale in mind. I decided to go more traditional with the permanent kitchen and bath fixtures, but have more fun with the wallpaper, fabrics, lighting, and other decorative items. Using the Tanzania wallpaper print in the entryway helped define the space and kept with the black-and-white color palette. When I decided to keep the studio apartment as an open plan, I still wanted to keep the bedroom area defined as its own and the wallpaper from Flat Vernacular—which I’m in love with—does that well. It also keeps with the light feeling of the space. My contractor suggested molding with clean profiles—it&#8217;s actually just lumber—that works perfectly with the simple baseboards. I love the detail on the new <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doors</a> that have a simple style but give a bit of interest around the casing, which also helps relieve any warping with time. The floors were sanded down and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refinished</a> in a matte gray tone.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The cramped, shallow bathtub was replaced with a large shower, making the space feel more open and so much more functional—perfect for containing Hudson’s bathtime messes. The deep <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage cabinet</a> above the toilet was one of the few things I&#8217;d probably do differently as it was a gaffe on my part. I ordered the cabinet without paying attention to how far out it would protrude—it&#8217;s 10-inches deep—and was installed with tile around it before I realized. It&#8217;s not the end of the world, but using a shallow medicine cabinet would have been a better choice.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">As with any reno, there were some hiccups along the way with permits taking a long time to come through and building regulations stopping work for any and all holidays. The 60-year-old pipes burst downstairs onto some very understanding neighbors, and then from above onto my freshly renovated space about a week after everything was done! </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Sweeten was a great partner along the way. Once I posted my project, they helped me figure out what I could do with my budget and asked the right questions so I could evaluate the bids I received. </span><span class="s1">They were a great sounding board when faced with questions during the process, such as delays and increased costs. I definitely recommend any renovator to use the Sweeten team to understand all the moving pieces throughout the process. Having lived in my space for some time now, I love it, and there isn&#8217;t much I would do differently. I am getting the bug to renovate and decorate a new space. So who knows, maybe I&#8217;ll be calling Sweeten again soon with a new space to refresh!</span></p>

</a>Photo: Sub-Zero/Wolf</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is so much talk today about creating a “smart home”—since the kitchen is usually the busiest room of the house, it has the opportunity to be the most intelligent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choices for kitchen appliances are driven by how the cookspace is used on a daily basis, what minimizes labor, and what cuts down cooking time. Take into consideration the steam oven cooking 3x faster or the dishwasher that packs more in a single cycle. Whether you are a gourmet chef or simply someone who likes good meals with minimal effort, the following features will help you to work smarter in the kitchen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Combination convection-steam oven</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to consumers’ desire for healthy meals that can be prepared in shorter-than-usual times comes the steam-assist oven. Usually combined with a convection feature, this oven circulates air for more even cooking and emits steam for juicier results with meat, chicken, and fish. Together, these functions can also reduce cooking time by as much as a third to a half, and that means a lower energy bill. This oven is great for reheating food the next day without drying it out. If you don’t want to commit to the triple-thousand-dollar price tag or switch out your present oven at the moment, there are countertop versions available from companies like Cuisinart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Induction cooktop</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not brand new to the scene, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank">induction</a> continues to innovate, ensuring its place in the working-smart kitchen appliances category. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Precision cooking</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Induction works by connecting to the size of the pan, heating only where it’s needed. This reduces energy waste from an open gas flame or an exposed electrical element that emits heat outside of its center of contact. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stay safe</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area around the cooking zone also stays relatively cool, as opposed to electric coils or the grate above a gas burner. So you don’t have to worry about an accidental burn. Look for added safety features such as automatic turnoff in the case of extreme heat or if a cooking zone operates for a particularly long time. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Save time</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some manufacturers, like Thermador, offer an induction cooktop with memory, so if you move a pan to another area of the surface, all the programmed settings will be transferred to the new location of the pan, eliminating the need to re-jigger that perfect heat adjustment. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Fridges with climate-controlled compartments </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication centers that take and send messages, and software that stores and transmits recipes are getting a lot of attention right now, but one factor remains constant: among the top complaints homeowners have for their refrigerators is food waste. Not that it’s the fridge’s fault, but the greater the capacity—and capacity is a major factor in selection—the more likely the cucumbers will get shoved to the back of the drawer, only to be discovered when they have become a slimy mess. To answer this, manufacturers have fine-tuned climate control with drawers that include dedicated convertible temperature settings so the cheese stays fresh and the lettuce crisp in their neighboring compartments. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refrigerator drawers such as those from Fisher &amp; Paykel offer subtle climate control for maximum flexibility when you toggle between the need for extra fridge or freezer space, or even to perfectly chill wine for a party.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bosch_079_rev3_PAGE_1C_jw_v12-noglow-e1495678384366.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24091 size-chrono" title="dishwasher" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bosch_079_rev3_PAGE_1C_jw_v12-noglow-723x542.jpg" alt="dishwasher" width="723" height="542" /></a>Photo: Bosch<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bosch_079_rev3_PAGE_1C_jw_v12-noglow-e1495678384366.jpg" target="_blank"><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Third-rack dishwasher</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the operation of a dishwasher is surely a science, the loading of the dishwasher is something of an art. The range of contents—dishes, pans, flatware, mixing bowls, hinged utensils—can require imagination and strategy to place them effectively for the best wash. With the addition of a third rack that can be adjusted to customize loads, many of those odd and oversized items, like sheet-cake pans and serving trays, can be cleaned at the same time as a complete load of dinner dishes, saving time, electricity, and water. Another option: twin removable trays that can be positioned to allow long-stemmed wine glasses on one side while stowing all the flatware in a rack atop the salad bowls on the other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hands-free faucet</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have two options here: a motion sensor in the shank of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-trends-kitchen-faucets/" target="_blank">faucet</a> that detects the wave of a hand to turn on the water, or a touch-sensitive version that operates with gentle pressure from the back of the wrist or elbow. The benefit is time (and water) saved in clean-up since you don’t have to wash down the handles repeatedly during the course of preparing a meal.</span></p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Take your smart kitchen one step further with a seamless, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank">integrated design</a> to keep your space clutter and chaos free.</p>

<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Integrated kitchen design, explained</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span>An integrated kitchen refers to a kitchen design in which components and appliances are integrated seamlessly into the overall design of the space. This type of kitchen often has a sleek and modern appearance, with clean lines and a cohesive look. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span>The aim of an integrated kitchen is to create a functional and stylish space that is easy to use and maintain. </span>Sweeten looks into this system called the integrated kitchen, sometimes referred to as a concealed kitchen. Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Before you shop, develop a plan for this specific cabinetry system. Any floor plan, from galley and L-shape to U-shape and open-concept can work. However, only certain appliance styles can be accommodated. F</span><span class="s1">loor-to-ceiling cabinetry lined up seamlessly can hide as much clutter as possible in an open-concept plan. </span></p>
<h4>Colors for an integrated kitchen</h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Choose a color and material scheme that is tonal, with smooth surfaces. The different areas blend into each other or at least transition quietly to create a harmonious living space.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you do have room for a dining table, try a banquette on the wall or in a corner if it’s available. Limiting the number of chairs will enhance the minimal effect and deemphasize a &#8220;kitchen&#8221; feel.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Minimalist kitchen remodel with white cabinets and hidden fridge" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone wp-image-47435 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></b><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> A concealed, minimalist kitchen in a</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenwich Village home remodel</a> with Sweeten</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Panels help hide appliances in an integrated kitchen</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">To some extent, appliances cannot be hidden completely, but certain features make them less noticeable. Consider the refrigerator. Counter-depth versions that are “panel ready” are available from a vast range of companies, including Sub-Zero, GE, Frigidaire, and KitchenAid. Replace the enamel or stainless steel front with a panel kit from your cabinet supplier, and the fridge, which no longer juts past the countertop, will almost disappear. Note that counter-depth fridges come as side-by-sides or top- or bottom-mounts, but they won’t have quite the cubic foot capacity of the freestanding or built-in models. In fact, they may be limited by as much as 2 to 5 cubic feet and up. If you have the room, you could add a refrigerator or freezer drawer that tucks discreetly under the counter.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Many dishwashers can also be fitted with a matching panel, or opt for an “architectural” version like those offered by manufacturers such as Whirlpool and Miele, which have controls concealed on the inside top of the door. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Panels can’t disguise stoves, cooktops, and ovens, but you can make choices that make these indispensable appliances less prominent. Go for induction cooktops that use a smooth, single surface with the heating elements concealed underneath. Digital controls (instead of knobs) also disappear when not in use. As for the vent hood, if you have a cooktop, you can get a downdraft that sits below the counter and pops up only when in use.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56602 size-full" title="integrated kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-19.jpg" alt="which is better kitchen peninsulas and islands" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Integrated</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen project</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">by Mitzie and Jenifer in Brooklyn</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Seamless kitchen cabinets</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">As the feature that typically takes up the most real estate in the kitchen, cabinets make or break the concealed look. European-style units open with gentle pressure applied to the outside of the door, making them a sensible choice for function and style. And hydraulic hinges on upper cabinets cause the doors to lift up and away with next to no effort. This type of sophistication comes at a price, however, so you might consider frameless doors and drawers, which completely cover the cabinet box, to suggest a seamless look. And where you can, take the cabinets up to the ceiling, to visually expand the appearance of the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Before you commit, research whether matching panels are available to fit your fridge and dishwasher. Your contractor can replace the existing panels easily. If you must add hardware, choose handles molded from one piece of metal, or doors and drawers that come with built-in channels that you can grab and pull.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Add outlets to the inside of some cabinets to create small appliance garages, with sturdy hinges that can raise heavy tools like mixers up and out.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Staging a sink in an integrated kitchen</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The sink will never disappear. However, if you choose an undermount sink, it will be less noticeable. An alternative: an integrated solid surface sink and countertop—virtually seam-free! The deeper the sink, the better it hides dirty dishes, of course. Some come with a cutting board accessory that tops the sink and creates an unbroken run of the countertop. Pair the sink with a touchless faucet for fewer visible details.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Concealing electrical outlets</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you use any small appliances or electronics in the kitchen (who doesn’t?), outlets are unavoidable. Minimize their appearance by choosing outlets that match the material or wall color—like with Lutron. When that isn&#8217;t possible, try grouping switches and outlets together to diminish their overall presence. Another strategy: tuck an outlet under an overhang of a countertop, or low on a wall near the top of the counter, where it can hardly be noticed.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Minimize obvious task lighting </b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Probably the easiest feature to conceal, lighting nevertheless deserves a little design attention. Use cans in the ceiling for ambient light, and hide those task lights by using LED strips below your upper cabinets. Do have some fun, however, with pendants over the sink or island and a chandelier above the dining table. This is the place to introduce some wit and individual style—essential ingredients for any successful room.</span></p>

<p>If you seek flexibility and a custom look in your kitchen, you may want to consider a cooktop and wall oven instead of the all-in-one range. Why not go the à la carte route and up the efficiency quotient? A separate cooktop gives you more choices for size and placement to suit the unique configuration of your cook space. What’s more, you can double up on cooking stations—say, one on a counter against a wall and one in an island—a big help if you have multiple chefs in your household or you entertain often. You’re then free to place that wall oven where you want, too, and even double up.</p>
<h3>Which cooktop type is best for your kitchen?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are three main cooktop types most commonly used today: induction cooktops, gas cooktops, and electric cooktops. Besides the type of power you may already have in your kitchen, there are other factors offered by each of these cooktops that will drive your decision. Next, we&#8217;ll dive into the key differences between the three major types of cooktops in American kitchens.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Induction cooktops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enthusiasm for induction cooktops has rapidly increased in the last few years, thanks to their convenience and precision in heating. Induction cooktops are sometimes called &#8220;electric induction&#8221; because electricity powers the energy source. But don&#8217;t be fooled<span>—</span>this isn&#8217;t your grandmother&#8217;s electric cooktop!</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Daniel-Hawkings-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Induction cooktop stove in a white contemporary kitchen " width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-41077 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Daniel-Hawkings-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Daniel-Hawkings-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Daniel-Hawkings-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></strong><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/kitchen-entertaining-media-pa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gina and Dan&#8217;s induction cooktop</a> in their Philadelphia-suburb kitchen</p>
<h4><strong>Pros of induction cooktops</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In these units, heat occurs between the interaction of the cookware with electromagnetic elements under the glass top. This is probably the most efficient way to cook since there is no flame or exposed coil that dissipates energy; instead, heat is transferred directly to the pan. Plus, since it’s the pan that heats, any part of the surface not in use remains cool, greatly reducing the risk of an accidental burn. Another pro: some induction cooktop models include touch and swipe controls for extremely accurate temperature control. For cleaning, a seamless and smooth glass surface means easier maintenance with the swipe of a cloth. No corners, grates, or coils are present to capture baked-on food.</p>
<h4>Limitations of induction cooktops</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Induction cooktops may require a different set of cookware than you already have: glass and ceramic won’t do. How to tell? Apply a magnet to your metal pan’s bottom. If it sticks, the pan works.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gas cooktops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A gas cooktop is a classic style sought after for its classic good looks, responsiveness, and the touch of drama it brings to cooking. Gas cooktops provide instant heat that’s easy to adjust. Models today typically include five burners: two on each side, and one in the middle. Most of these models will offer one high-powered burner to quickly boil water and one that goes very low to simmer or to warm foods. Look for sealed burners to simplify maintenance and continuous grates that let you slide over a heavy pot. For gas cooktops, all types of cookware are suitable.</p>

<h4>Limitations of gas cooktops</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With gas cooktops, you still need to be careful of the open flame needed for cooking. Additionally, this style only works only an overhead ventilation system. As with ranges, do not place the cooktop under a window or near a door as drafts are a fire hazard.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Electric cooktops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, you <em>can</em> still find electric coil cooktops, and they still operate with radiant heat; however, they’re now at the super-budget end of the spectrum. If this style is for you, seek out electric cooktops topped with glass surfaces for a sleek, contemporary look and easy care. Also, look for an option for touch controls (though classic knobs can still be found too.) Seek out electric cooktop models with four elements, with at least two of the elements offering expansion to a larger cooking surface. An indicator will tell you when the surface is still hot.</p>
<h4>Limitations of electric cooktops</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although these are a good choice for the budget-conscious, keep in mind it will take a while for this cooktop to cool down once you’ve turned off the heat.</p>
<h3>Consider: Where to place your new cooktop</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, take into account any existing electric or gas lines. For example, if you are remodeling and wish to move your cooktop to a work island, you will have to pay an electrician for the power to be run to that new location. When placing the cooktop unit on a countertop, keep it clear of upper cabinets and plan for landing space on at least one side of the cooktop. If installing in an island, position the cooktop so the chef can face the room and its guests. Avoid potentially drafty areas, such as near a window or doorway. The open space under the cooktop is handy for storing cooking pots, so plan for a cabinet with wide doors. A drawer won’t work due to the power lines, but an open slide-out shelf will work, and still allow access to those lines.</p>
<h3>Consider: Ventilation options</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Remember to plan for how you will vent from the cooktop. Like with ranges, do not place the cooktop under or near a window, as drafts are a fire hazard when food is cooking on a burner. An island cooktop can take an overhead vent projecting from the ceiling (and a gas cooktop requires overhead venting), but then the vent will stand out in the kitchen, possibly more prominently than you wish. The alternative, for electric induction only, is a downdraft vent. Concealed in its location along the back of the cooktop, a downdraft vent rises electronically from its recess with the flip of a switch. It then pulls cooking fumes downward into a grate and recirculates the air after removing odors and moisture. When not in use, the vent can be electronically lowered back into the recess in the surface where it is installed. Some cooktop models come with this feature included, or you can purchase and install a vent separately. Downdraft will never be as powerful as overhead, but it does help to eliminate odors and airborne moisture and grease when cooking.</p>
<h3>Consider: Size and functions</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are replacing an existing cooktop, you may be stuck with that model’s size unless you have budgeted to replace the surrounding cabinets and countertop too. Happily, manufacturers offer gas, induction, and electric cooktops in a range of dimensions that include more features as the width increases. Where once four burners were the norm, more homeowners are opting for six burners, which offer greater flexibility—like expandable heating elements that can handle extra-large pots, or griddles, or a super low-heat warming burner—so you can have more pans cooking all at once. You can still enjoy a super-size experience if your kitchen is small. Both gas and electric units with 5 burners come in a 30-inch size, which will fit in many small cook spaces. Electric radiant cooktops with a glass surface topping four burners can also be found in 24-inch widths.</p>
