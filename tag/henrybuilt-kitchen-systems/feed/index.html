<h3>A full gut renovation</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When we purchased our apartment, we knew that we were going to renovate it.  As someone who loves design, I saw the potential and welcomed the opportunity to take a space and figure out how to best make it work for our family of five including three boys (and two dogs). I did not, however, anticipate we would be undertaking a full gut renovation—and while we had renovated before, those projects were a much smaller scope.</span></p>

<h3>Working with an architect</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before we closed on our apartment, we began working with our <a href="https://www.jwarchitecturedpc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect Jessica Wetters</a> on how to change the layout of the apartment. The plan was to open it up and improve the light and flow. The living spaces would be connected as well as add a bedroom and a half-bathroom. It was clear to our architect that the apartment required a full-gut renovation and that little could be saved. After a few rounds of revising the plans, we arrived at a layout that achieved our objectives.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13.jpg" alt="hallway" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44266" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Finding the right contractor</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before we found Sweeten, we began working with a contractor on the budget for the project and costs kept going up. We were at the point where we were cutting parts of the project that were important to us (like millwork) and making compromises we weren’t comfortable with in order to stay within budget. I decided to post our project on Sweeten. It would allow me to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add more cost estimates into the mix</a> with their network of general contractors and see if I had unrealistic expectations. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg" alt="foyer" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44263" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4.jpg" alt="Henrybuilt kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44264" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sweeten matched us with three contractors, but after <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interviewing this general contractor</a>, I knew he was the one for our project. Not only did he assure us that he could get us everything we wanted within our budget, but he promised that he would minimize the disruption to our lives and work with our aggressive timeline.   </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5.jpg" alt="Henrybuilt kitchen" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44267" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As soon as we hired him, things moved quickly and once we had all of the necessary approvals, we moved into a rental apartment. Demolition began</span><span class="s2"> in February and work was completed over the summer. </span></p>

<h3>Functional and modern</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The first decision we made was the kitchen. I knew I wanted a Henrybuilt kitchen. I love the functionality and feel of our kitchen. We also planned for a black wall in the living room using huge porcelain tile slabs to camouflage our TV and it turned out even better than I expected. I researched industrial factory doors to connect the living room and bedrooms, but it was over-budget (even the reclaimed factory doors I saw were $7,000+) so I had a door made with a similar look for a small fraction of the cost.</span></p>

<h3>Replacing the floors</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In addition to opening up the kitchen, foyer, and living room, we enlarged the size of our master bathroom and added closets in unused space in the master bedroom. Throughout the apartment, we replaced the hardwood floors, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coated the walls</a>, replaced the trim, replaced all of the lighting, and added millwork.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">Even though we lived there without a kitchen which wasn’t optimal, there was no question that it would be worth it in the end. </span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When I told our Sweeten contractor that our rental ended in June and that we wanted to move back in before the apartment was completed, he worked with us to allow us to do that—despite his strong recommendation that we hold off moving in. Even though we lived there without a kitchen which wasn’t optimal—his crew set up a refrigerator in the middle of the apartment—there was no question that it would be worth it in the end. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-bathroom-16.jpg" alt="vertical shower tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44260" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-bathroom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-bathroom-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-bathroom-16-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3 class="p4">The perfect finished product</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When a couple of unexpected structural issues were discovered during demo that required changes to the layout, our contractor immediately contacted our architect and me and proposed solutions that ended up improving the project. Issues that could have induced panic and delays were addressed efficiently and proactively. Our contractor, our architect, and I met at the apartment nearly every week to discuss progress and make decisions to ensure that the project kept moving forward on schedule. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are thrilled with the results. We achieved exactly the look and feel we were going for and I firmly believe that the process went as smoothly and efficiently as it did, thanks to our contractor, his crew, and our architect.  </span></p>
