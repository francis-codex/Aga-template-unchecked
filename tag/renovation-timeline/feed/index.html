			<h2>Providing deposits for contractors is a crucial<span>—and normal—step in starting a renovation</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="room-ready-for-renovation" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront.jpg" alt="Image of room ready for renovation" width="1000" height="665" class="alignnone wp-image-51631 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Short answer: Yes. </span><span class="s1">But there are exceptions, and your contractor may have some flexibility. Below, Sweeten outlines the reasons behind upfront payment amounts, and some options for negotiating your deposit for a contractor.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do contractors require a deposit?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deposits for contractors are critical because they essentially allow your project to begin! Your general contractor needs to secure a crew and begin <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordering materials right away</a>. They may also need to rent equipment. And your contractor can’t take on all the financial liability for these commitments themself.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much of a deposit can a contractor ask for? </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The exact deposit amount contractors ask for upfront varies and is especially dependent on the size of the project. For relatively small jobs, like a $16,000 <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/">bathroom remodel</a>, contractors may ask for a 50% deposit. For large jobs, like a $100,000 <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/">full-home renovation</a>, a 10%–20% deposit is more typical. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Is the deposit for a contractor negotiable?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might be. In many cases, contractors start with a standardized contract, so some of the terms could be based on a typical job rather than the specifics of yours. You may be able to ask for somewhat lower initial payment or deposit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ideal time to ask is during negotiations (—an important part of <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/">the contractor hiring process</a>), before the contractor drafts the contract. But they may be amenable to a minor contract alteration after the fact. Just know that their flexibility may be limited. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What about the remaining payments?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">General contractors use a number of different fee structures. The payment schedule might be based on fixed dates, or on major project milestones. For small jobs, they’ll typically ask for just two payments—one upfront, the other at the end. For larger projects, there may be as many as five scheduled payments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most contractors ask for the final payment upon “substantial completion.” This means that everything’s complete except the punch list*, and possibly final work on minor finishes. Occasionally, a contractor will consider a job substantially complete when there’s a single large outstanding item—like an expensive fixture that’s held up by a shipping delay, but which won’t require much labor to install. When you&#8217;re ready to begin your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/">find a vetted and experienced contractor</a>. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">*The punch list is a tally of any minor problems for the contractor to fix—like a paint splatter, a missing drawer pull, a misaligned cabinet hinge, etc.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Points to remember for contractor deposits:</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Expect to pay a deposit for a contractor before work can begin<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Expect to pay a higher percentage on a smaller job, and vice-versa<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Discuss the contractors&#8217; deposit and payment schedule before they draft the contract<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">If you’d like to amend the contract, don’t expect the contractor to have unlimited flexibility<br />
</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A step-by-step guide and timeline for a one-bedroom apartment renovation</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32172 size-full" title="brick-wall-blue-white-couch" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13.jpg" alt="brick wall in living room with blue and white couches and a blue rug after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Should you renovate in stages or all at once?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’ve covered the expected timelines for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-kitchen-renovation-take-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovations</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bath renovations</a>, but <strong>how long does an entire apartment renovation take?</strong> Since bathrooms and kitchens are usually the most time-intensive spaces to redo, the timeline for renovating a one-bedroom apartment is not much longer. Another bonus: the more spaces there are, the more opportunity there is to implement economies of scale and to multi-task! This approach allows you to save both time and money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re considering spacing out several projects (for budgetary reasons), you should consider doing them all at once. While it’s a larger sum upfront, it’ll likely be a better value for your money. For example, while you’re waiting for your cabinets to arrive, your contractor can paint the bedroom or install baseboards. Also, consider the cost– and time–effectiveness in using the permits and crew already scheduled for your project for a full scope rather than securing them multiple times.</p>
<h3>General timeframe for a one-bedroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As always, size and complexity determine how long an entire apartment renovation will take. If you aren&#8217;t moving walls or changing electrical or plumbing, your apartment renovation will be on the shorter side. <strong>On average, you should allocate about three to five months for on-site work in a top-to-bottom one-bedroom apartment renovation.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Apartment Renovation Timeline:</strong><strong> Pre-Construction Phase</strong></h3>
<p>While the attention is usually on the most visible construction phase, there is a lot to be done before then. Here are the details on each box you&#8217;ll need to check before breaking ground on the project.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 1: Close on your property (1-3 months)</strong></h4>
<p>Many homeowners are in-contract or preparing to close on a property when they begin the process of planning a renovation. If this is you, don&#8217;t worry: there&#8217;s a way to get it all done. As one <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> post explains, you should wait until you have <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/dos-donts-closing-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed on the property</a>, with keys in hand, before doing anything. If you’re in a hurry—wait until you’ve at least signed the contract before beginning the design process.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 2: Post your renovation project on Sweeten (5 minutes)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you&#8217;re in contract, or if you already own your apartment, you can post your project to Sweeten and <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin soliciting bids</a>. Add the details about the space you want to renovate, your inspiration photos (optional but useful for our matchmakers), and any other information that would help us find your perfect contractors. We&#8217;ll connect you with 3-5 of our trusted, vetted contractors who are a good fit for your project. </p>
<h4><strong>STEP 3: Schedule site visits and solicit bids (1-3 weeks)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve previewed the Sweeten contractors&#8217; profiles, and have decided you&#8217;d like to set up a meeting(s), our online scheduler will give you a two-week window to mark your available dates for a site visit. Both you and the contractor(s)  will receive an email confirming your available times, by which the contractor(s) will reach out to you to confirm a date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An on-site visit is the best way for a contractor to understand the scope of the project, the physical possibilities, and limitations of the space, and for the two of you to see if you hit it off! (This <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/prep-bid-remodel-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide</a> is a useful read for understanding the key info necessary to secure the most accurate bid.) After you schedule your on-site visit, check out our blog post about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to prepare</a> for the meeting. You should expect a written bid within 5-10 business days after your visit.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 4: Level bids and choose a contractor (1-2 weeks)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once all the written bids have come in, it’s time to compare and contrast! This <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primer</a> on leveling bids might come in handy. If you have follow-up questions, now is the time to ask. You can also schedule time with a Sweeten project advisor to walk you through the various bids and weigh in on the selection.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 5: Sign the contract and finalize construction schedule (1 week)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve decided on a contractor, he or she will put together a contract for you to review. This will typically include a description of the work to be done, an estimated timeline for completion, as well as the timing of payments throughout the project.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 6: Obtain permits and approvals (ranges widely)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of all the steps where hiccups or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delays might occur</a>, this is it. Obtaining the correct permits and board approvals have held up many a renovation, but don’t be daunted: our experts are well-versed in navigating these processes and can advise you on how best to achieve your renovation goals with the least amount of hassle. If you’re moving plumbing or gas lines, you’ll need an architect and additional DOB permits. Sweeten homeowners have reported obtaining approvals in as little as two weeks—but it’s more common for it to take a couple months.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you live in a stand-alone house, you won’t need to worry about building board approvals, but you’ll still need the requisite city permits for any electrical or plumbing work to make sure that everything is up to code.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 7: Source materials (ranges widely)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are responsible for sourcing all or some of the materials in your renovation, be sure to place the orders as soon as the design plan is finished. Certain items have long lead times, and you don’t want that one faucet to hold up the entire renovation. If time is a concern, look at what’s currently in stock and ready to ship. Speak with your contractor about timing the product delivery to coincide with time of installation.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 8: Tell your neighbors you&#8217;re renovating (15 minutes)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be a good neighbor and warn yours that a renovation is beginning imminently. Tell them what to expect and how long the project is slated to last. It’s always easier to stomach the disruption when you know there’s an end in sight! It doesn’t hurt to bring some sweets, a bottle of wine, or a gift card for a local coffee shop. When the reno is over, invite them over!</p>
<h3><strong>Apartment Renovation Timeline</strong><strong>: Construction Phase</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While most of the steps under “Construction” are your contractor’s responsibility, it’s important to understand what should be happening when. The most important steps you’ll be in charge of here are making scheduled payments to your contractor (as outlined in your contract), and keeping your schedule open for several hours a week to answer questions about details or changes that come up over the course of construction.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 9: Time for demolition (2-5 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Out with the old! Now that you’re done with the paperwork, it’s time for your contractor to pick up that sledgehammer. Be sure to protect the items that are staying with tarp or plastic, and get to work tearing out everything else. Depending on how large your apartment is, and how extensive the renovation, this shouldn’t take more than two to five days.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 10: Reroute plumbing and electrical (2-4 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our national survey, 62% of respondents named finding hidden problems in their home as a top renovation fear. Now that you’ve stripped the space down to the studs, it’ll be easy to get new plumbing or electrical where it needs to go. Consider whether any plans should be altered now, since you&#8217;re able to see what’s behind the walls.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 11: City inspections and sign-offs (1-4 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you needed city permits for electrical and/or plumbing work, you&#8217;ll need inspections and a sign-off before closing the walls. While a master plumber can typically sign off on pipework for water lines in the case of a no-show by the city inspector, an inspector must examine and approve any work on gas lines. You are not allowed to close up the walls and move onto the next phase of the project until this inspection happens. With electrical work, inspectors generally are scheduled for visits once the project is 100 percent complete, and they will check the electrical panel, junction boxes, and outlets. (Note that sometimes, because of city bureaucracy and delays, your electrical inspection may be rescheduled two or three times.) Check with your contractor or architect about what your project requires.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 12: Floor installation (5-12 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To prevent having to redo the floors if you decide to reconfigure your space in the future, make sure that the flooring is consistent throughout, even if some of it will be hidden. After the floors are in, you’ll add new baseboards.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 13: Installation completion (5-20 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Install the kitchen, usually in this order: cabinets, appliances, fixtures and lighting, counters, backsplash, and cabinet hardware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Install the bathroom, including the tub, vanity and sink, toilet, and any built-in shelving. Tiling, lighting, and hardware usually come last.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the hallways and bedroom, if you are doing basic painting and touch-ups, the work will be fairly minimal compared to the kitchen and bath. If you are adding custom, built-in shelving or paneling, plan to add a few extra days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Possible delays: aspects of this may vary, depending on site conditions and the arrival time of the materials.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 14: Clean-up (1 day)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, contracts allow that spaces should be left in “broom-swept” condition. However, you may want to hire post-construction cleaning specialists to make sure that your new floor is clean enough to eat off. For a full apartment, plan on requesting at least two cleaners to work at the same time so that it can be finished in one working day.</p>
<h3><strong>Apartment Renovation Timeline: Post-Construction Phase </strong></h3>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">The finish line is in sight! But don’t forget these last—but important—steps. </span></p>
<h4><strong>STEP 15: Final walk-through with the contractor (1-2 hours)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Review the work with your contractor: try all the drawers and doors, look closely at the edges and finishes, and make sure everything is working the way it should. If there are any problems, point it out and add them to the punch list. The contractor will either fix it on the spot (if it’s minor) or set up another time to return. Sweeten&#8217;s founder + CEO, Jean Brownhill, recommends keeping notepads in each space, and not speaking to your contractor for two weeks during this time. Instead, take notes of what needs fixing as you live in your new home.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 16: Punch list items (1-10 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on what the items are, this step could take anywhere from a day to several weeks. It depends on the items left: are you straightening a cabinet door, or waiting on installing an out-of-stock item? When it’s on the long side, though, it&#8217;s usually due to back-ordered items. Otherwise, your contractor should be able to return and fix everything in a few days.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 17: The final payment (10 minutes)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You’ve (hopefully)! made installments throughout the renovation. When the last item on your punch list is complete, it’s time to pay the remaining percentage to your contractor!</p>
<h3>Ready to renovate your apartment?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This timeline provides a detailed look at the various aspects of renovating and a range of how long each step should take. While some factors may be outside of both your and the contractor’s control, the key is isolating the steps that you think might be obstacles in advance, and allotting more time to get them done.</p>

<h3>Popular Questions Asked</h3>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639487570544"><strong class="schema-faq-question">How long does it take to renovate an apartment?</strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Apartment renovation timelines are highly variable. On the short end, an apartment renovation from beginning to end could take 4 months; on the long end, it could take over a year. Obtaining permits from local municipalities, sourcing materials, and construction can add significant time to the renovation schedule. For example, some municipalities have very strict permitting processes or may require specific plans to be submitted by an architect before permits are issued. If you’re sourcing luxury materials from sources abroad, shipping and importing the products can be lengthy. Also, discovering hidden surprises during demolition (think: water damage, or wiring issues) may require a contracting team to problem-solve before proceeding with construction as planned. </p>

<h3>Be proactive with your Sweeten contractor&#8217;s guidance</h3>
<p class="p1">At Sweeten, our goal is to educate homeowners on the many moving parts of renovating. We share the most common renovation delays that can impact project timelines. While each delay may not be able to be avoided, we offer insight for clarity and tips on how to alleviate its negative impact. Smart prep and setting realistic expectations will help get you to the finish line.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free. Learn more about <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/">how Sweeten works</a>.</span></p>
<h3><b>Renovation Delays 1: Building approval and requirements</b></h3>
<p>Apartment owners generally need approval from the building before starting a remodel. The timeline (especially the start date) for approval is out of your hands for weeks or even months.</p>
<p>Most buildings require that you assemble a package of materials to define the project scope and the qualifications of the team you’re bringing on to complete it. This takes some time and organization to pull together. Depending on your building, the approval turnaround time may last a few days or could be tied to a monthly meeting review cycle. (This can be especially challenging when a building board skips or postpones regular meetings around holidays or over the summer).</p>
<p>Your crew must comply with the building rules throughout the renovation. A document called the “<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-what-is-an-alteration-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alteration agreement</a>” typically outlines the rules, and it can dramatically affect the construction schedule. For example, your building may limit daily work hours, halt work on holidays, or cap total duration of construction. It can also set boundaries on the scope of work, detail lead or asbestos requirements that exceed local regulations, and more. Protecting the common hallway may be another requirement, which adds to the crew&#8217;s daily set-up and breakdown needs.</p>
<h4>Alteration Requirement tips</h4>
<p>We often hear that a building is really strict. The reality is that buildings have wide leeway to run their operations as they see fit. But the rules must be applied equally to all residents. If an alteration requirement is included in your building&#8217;s written agreement, that typically indicates that it has gone through the management structure and is applied uniformly. However, if you are told to follow a rule that is not in the alteration agreement and this is the first you’re hearing about it, you may be able to make the case that the requirement isn&#8217;t being uniformly applied and is therefore unfair. People occasionally try to get the building management to reconsider, but most of the time, the building’s requirements are just accepted as part of the cost of doing business.</p>
<h3><b>Renovation Delays 2:</b><b> Lead times and dependencies</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Picking materials</a> is an exciting part of any reno project</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—especially if you’re using unique or unusual items. However, fabrication and shipping can have extensive lead times. It’s not at all unusual to find 12- to 15-week lead times on handmade products, and international suppliers have to contend with unpredictable border crossing.</span></p>
<p>Even with the best planning, certain renovation steps require that material is installed before finalizing any related elements. For example, a countertop comes with high stakes. The material is a large, heavy piece prepped offsite with no room for error. Generally, you can&#8217;t measure countertops (known as “templating”) until you&#8217;ve installed cabinet bases. Your project might be off to the races and then it will appear to grind to a halt as you wait for the countertop supplier to measure onsite before prepping and delivering your slab. The wait is worth it, but it can be maddening to feel close to the finish line with nothing happening in between these steps.</p>
<h4>Material Tracking Tip</h4>
<p>As you pick materials, track product lead times and be prepared to find a back-up if something is not in stock or is months away. Alert your contractor early on if you&#8217;re using materials shipping from outside the United States. Starting a project before every single item is delivered is a gamble that everyone takes, but tracking lead times will help you stay realistic.</p>
<h3><b>Renovation Delays </b><b>3: Discoveries during construction </b></h3>
<p>Unless your contractor breaks through a surface and does a probe, they can’t know exactly what is behind walls and under floors. A pre-renovation probe sounds great in theory, but the reality is that most people skip it because it can mean having holes in your home before you’ve even decided who to hire. A contractor might be willing to open up a wall for you before you’ve signed a contract, but they will not patch it back up for free. You have to be willing to accept that your team may make discoveries that affect the timeline once work gets underway.</p>
<h4>Site surprise tip</h4>
<p>Ask your contractor about worst-case scenarios given the building’s age and history. Is it possible you’ll uncover major plumbing or electrical needs? What about sub-floor issues or structural problems? If so, what effects could those have on your budget and timeline? Consider the budget contingency you may need to have peace of mind when your project kicks off. Your contractor can’t price out every possible surprise, but you should feel confident that you have a partner who will help you problem-solve when challenges come up.</p>
<h3><b>Renovation Delays 4:</b><b> Permits + Inspections </b></h3>
<p>It should be no surprise to hear that permits affect a project schedule. But one aspect of inspection logistics can be perplexing.</p>
<p>Your local municipality controls permits and inspection approvals. What might be new for a first-time renovator is that there can be multiple inspections needed for a single aspect of a project. Frequently, these inspections are scheduled right as key work is happening. Progress often looks unpredictable or disorganized because work can’t move forward in a linear way. For example, a bathroom remodel that moves plumbing lines has to wait for an inspection before closing up the walls. Also, it might even pause <em>again</em> for a final inspection to close out the permit. Because of this, there can be gaps where a crew can’t continue work and isn’t onsite while the City schedules and conducts its visits.</p>
<h4>Permit &amp; Inspections Tip</h4>
<p>Talk to your contractor about permit and inspection steps to get a feel for the variables. What may feel like a surprise delay could be a planned process step that is just out of your hands.</p>
<h3><b>Renovation Delays </b><b>5: Site downtime</b></h3>
<p>Downtime on the construction site may not actually be a sign of a delay. However, when you&#8217;re living without a functional kitchen or bathroom, days without work happening can feel like torture.</p>
<p>The reality is that project progress doesn’t operate from 9am to 5pm, five days a week. Your contractor should generally schedule the crew to maximize progress. They will also need to balance logistics including the availability of materials, building rules, or logical work sequencing. Some materials need time to cure or set. Also, individual crew member health and family issues as well as commitments on other projects are taken into consideration. These are all moving pieces.</p>
<p>Also, as a job progresses, the required skill level increases. The worker who completes demolition may not have the specialized skills of the person installing your glass mosaic tile. Specialized trades are in higher demand, so when more highly skilled subs are needed, it can result in schedule gaps.</p>
<h4>Coverage tip</h4>
<p>Larger, more established teams may manage coverage more seamlessly, while smaller teams may have to get creative to run their businesses. As a result, you may see associated costs or savings with these different levels of service. If you feel frustrated about the schedule, tune into specifics. Are there unexplained gaps in work? Are you uncertain about the overall timeline or a move-in date that might require alternate planning? Communicate with your team about specific areas where crew availability or progress is a concern for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to set realistic expectations on your client</span><span class="s1"> renovation timelines</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47786 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">A speedy construction schedule might seem like the key to happy clients, but realistic expectations may actually be more important in getting to<span class="s1"> the finish line. Sweeten often hears questions and concerns about construction schedules, so we&#8217;re sharing what we’ve learned so you, the contractor, can help clients better understand the moving pieces in a renovation. Sweeten has also shared with blog readers <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/common-renovation-delays-how-to-prepare-for-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most common renovation delays</a> and the actions they can take to be prepared.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness, and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">The Start Date Gamble</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an ideal world, everything would be on-site before work starts. But who has room to store a new kitchen for two months before demolition begins? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Starting a project before everything is delivered is a risk that everyone takes. Help your client see this as a reasonable gamble. </span><span class="s1">One that comes with the benefit of speed and the risk of future delay. Make sure you’re both comfortable with the same bet: that project progress and material delivery will depend on each other down the road.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Talk to Clients about Major Renovation Milestones</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Clients often ask, “When will this project be done?”  </span><span class="s2">That question can be tough to answer before the work starts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guide your client to think about major milestones in the project, like:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Target start &#8211;</b>&#8211; <i>Will approvals, design decisions, and other prep needs (like temporary accommodations) affect the date?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Demolition &#8212; </b><i>How long will it take and what might be hidden under floors and behind walls?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Electrical, plumbing, and specialized trades &#8212;</b> <i>Will you need to work with someone else’s schedule and availability?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Inspections &#8212;</b> <i>Will progress pause for inspections?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Finish work &#8212; </b><i>Will materials be available on time?</i><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s always helpful for clients to hear how long a project generally takes from start to finish, so feel free to estimate by days or weeks. But keeping the focus on start date range, major milestones, and potential variables will help your client feel more prepared for what is to come.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Handling Client Expectations for Renovation Surprises</span></h3>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p>You won&#8217;t know what&#8217;s behind the walls until you&#8217;re hired and work can begin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p>Discuss with the homeowner the worst-case scenario based on the building&#8217;s age and history. Will there be issues with the electrical, plumbing, or structure? Let them know if they should prepare for contingencies in their budget. You won&#8217;t be able to price out every possible surprise but communicate with the homeowner how you will problem-solve when hurdles arise.</p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"> Fitting Subcontractors, Crew, and Inspector Schedules into Client Timelines</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten clients are often surprised by downtime once the project starts. They think of a project as moving in a straight line. Also, they may believe you have total control over the crew.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Make sure they aren’t wondering where your crew is! </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Help them understand that some steps depend on sub or vendor scheduling.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Talk to them about how inspections need to be scheduled and then wait for the inspector.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Explain that you may need to wait for a more skilled worker to complete a specific step.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make it clear that there may be days where no work is happening and that this is a natural part of the process.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We also often hear that a crew started late in the day, or left the site early. This can be a big pain point, especially if your client thinks the project isn’t moving fast enough. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can get out ahead of this. Make sure your client knows that you are focused on progress, but that you also have to balance:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The logical sequence of work<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Availability of materials<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Individual crewmember health and family issues<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Commitments to other projects<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This doesn’t mean the project isn’t a priority, it’s simply how you run a business.</span></p>

<h3>Getting your renovation on the calendar</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most common questions that we at Sweeten hear from homeowners is “How long does a kitchen renovation take?” This usually comes right after “How much does a <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen renovation cost</a>?” Our handy <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renovation Checklist</a> tells you what you need to do—but how long does it take to do it all?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Typically, we suggest that after closing on your apartment, you allow three weeks to four months for the completion of your kitchen renovation. The timeframe depends on complexity, the size of your space, and scope.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, if you are 1) not altering the footprint, 2) not changing or adding electrical or plumbing, and 3) using stock cabinetry and appliances, it’s reasonable to expect that your renovation will be done in a few weeks. If, however, you are moving your kitchen from one part of your home to another, requiring both city permits as well as board approvals, and using imported custom cabinets—you should give it several months. The wide range is due to the fact that there can be many moving parts and multiple parties involved. Certain aspects may be beyond your control. Sweeten breaks down a kitchen renovation step-by-step.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3>PRE-CONSTRUCTION PHASE</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the attention is usually on the most visible construction phase, a lot needs to happen before picking up that sledgehammer. Here, the details on each box that needs to be ticked before you break ground on the project.</p>
<h3>STEP 1: Close on your property (1-3 months)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a significant number of homeowners who are in contract or preparing to close on a property when they begin the process of planning a renovation. The best advice is to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/dos-donts-closing-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wait until you have closed on the property</a>, with keys in hand, before doing anything. If you’re in a hurry—at least wait until you’ve signed the contract before beginning the design process.</p>
<h3>STEP 2: Post your project (1-3 days)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First things first: Post your project to Sweeten and begin soliciting bids. On the Sweeten site, add some details about the space you want to renovate. Inspiration photos are optional but useful for us to find you contractors who have done similar styles. Include any other information that would help Sweeten match you with the right contractors. You&#8217;ll receive 3-5 matches with links to check out contractors&#8217; profiles online. Read reviews from clients and photos of their past projects to see whether they might be a good fit.</p>
<h3>STEP 3: Schedule site visits and solicit bids (1-3 weeks)</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Decide which contractors you’d like to set up a meeting with and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/prep-bid-remodel-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prepare for an on-site visit</a>. An in-person visit is the best way for a contractor to understand the scope of the project, the physical possibilities, and the limitations of the space. You&#8217;ll also see if personalities and communication styles mesh. You should expect a written bid within 5-7 business days after your visit.</span></p>

<h3>STEP 4: Level bids and choose a contractor (1-2 weeks)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once all the written bids have come in, it’s time to compare and contrast! This <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primer</a> on leveling bids might come in handy. If you have follow-up questions, now is the time to ask. You can also schedule time with Sweeten to walk you through the various bids and weigh in on the selection.</p>
<h3>STEP 5: Sign a contract and finalize construction schedule (1 week)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve decided on a contractor, he or she will put together a contract for you to review. This will typically include a description of the work to be done, an outline of the costs, as well as the timing of payments throughout the project.</p>
<h3>STEP 6: Obtain permits and approvals (ranges widely)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of all the steps where hiccups or delays might occur, this is it. Obtaining the correct permits and necessary approvals have held up many a renovation, but don’t be daunted. Sweeten contractors are well-versed in navigating these processes and often can advise you on how to achieve your renovation goals with the least amount of hassle. If you’re moving plumbing or gas lines, you’ll need an architect and additional DOB permits. Sweeten homeowners have reported obtaining approvals in as little as two weeks—but it’s more common for it to take a couple months.</p>
<p>If you live in a stand-alone house, you won’t need to worry about building board approvals. However, you’ll still need the requisite city permits for any electrical or plumbing work to make sure everything is up to code.</p>
<h3>STEP 7: Source materials (ranges widely)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are responsible for sourcing all or some of the materials in your renovation, be sure to place the orders as soon as the design plan is finished. Certain items have long lead times, and you don’t want that one faucet to hold up the entire renovation. If time is a concern, look at what’s currently in stock and ready to ship. Speak with your contractor about timing the product delivery to coincide with time of installation.</p>
<h3>STEP 8: Tell your neighbors you&#8217;re renovating (15 minutes)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be a good neighbor and alert them. Tell them what to expect and how long the project is slated to last. It’s always easier to stomach the disruption when you know there’s an end in sight! It doesn’t hurt to bring some sweets, a bottle of wine, or a gift card for a local coffee shop. When the reno is over, invite them over!</p>
<h3>CONSTRUCTION PHASE</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: While most of the steps under “Construction” are your contractor’s responsibility, it’s important to understand what should be happening and when. It is vital to make the scheduled payments to your contractor (as outlined in your contract) so the project can keep moving forward. Also, keep your schedule open for several hours a week to answer questions about details or changes that come up over the course of construction. </em></p>
<h3>STEP 9: It’s demo time (1-2 days)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Out with the old! Now that you’re done with the paperwork, it’s time (for your contractor) to pick up that sledgehammer. Items that are staying should be protected with tarp or plastic. Depending on how large your kitchen is, and how extensive the renovation, this shouldn’t take more than a day or two.</p>
<h3>STEP 10: Reroute plumbing and electrical (1-4 days)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the space stripped down to the studs, new plumbing or electrical can be placed where it needs to go. Consider whether any plans need to be altered now that you can see what’s behind the walls.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">STEP 11: City inspections and sign-offs (1 hour on-site)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you needed city permits, inspections and a final sign-off may be needed before the walls are closed up, particularly with gas lines. <span class="s1">While it may take the inspector an hour to do his job at the site, scheduling the actual appointment could take days or weeks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A master plumber is typically allowed to sign off on pipework for water lines if the city inspector doesn&#8217;t show up. However, an inspector must examine and approve any work on gas lines. You are not allowed to close up the walls and move onto the next phase of the project before this inspection happens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: With electrical work, inspectors generally are scheduled for visits once the project is 100 percent complete. They will check the electrical panel, junction boxes, and outlets. Sometimes, because of city bureaucracy and delays, your electrical inspection may be rescheduled two or three times. </p>
<h3>STEP 12: Installation &#8211; floors (1-5 days)</h3>
<p class="p1">Make sure the flooring you choose is consistent throughout the room, even if they’re hidden. If you decide in the future to reconfigure the cabinet layout, the floors won’t need to be redone.</p>
<h3>STEP 13: Installation &#8211; all other material including cabinets and appliances (1-10 days)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation of all other materials is usually in this order: cabinets, appliances, fixtures and lighting, counters, backsplash, and cabinet hardware. Aspects of this may vary, depending on site conditions, and the arrival time of the materials.</p>
<h3>STEP 14: Clean-up (1 day)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, contracts allow that the space is left in a “broom-swept” condition. However, you may want to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/clean-up-after-major-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hire post-construction cleaning specialists</a> to ensure it is cleaned to your specifications.</p>
<h3>POST-CONSTRUCTION PHASE</h3>
<h3>STEP 15: Final walk-through with your contractor (30-60 minutes)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Review the work with your contractor: try all the drawers and doors, look closely at the edges and finishes, and make sure everything is working the way it should. If there are any problems, point them out and add them to the punch list. The contractor will either fix it on the spot (if it’s minor) or set up another time to return. Sweeten&#8217;s founder + CEO, Jean Brownhill, advises to keep notepads in each space, and not speak to your contractor for two weeks during this time. Take notes of what needs fixing as you live in your new home.</p>
<h3>STEP 16: Punch list items (1-10 days)</h3>
<p class="p1">Punch list items can be issues from straightening a cabinet door to waiting on installing that last out-of-stock item. Completing the punch list can take anywhere from a day to several weeks. When it’s on the long side, though, that is usually due to items being back-ordered. Otherwise, your contractor should be able to return and fix everything in a few days.</p>
<h3>STEP 17: The final payment (10 minutes)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the last item on your punch list has been addressed, the remaining payment is paid to your contractor and the project is complete. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This timeline is meant to give you a detailed look at the various aspects of renovating and typical time ranges. Factors that may be outside of both your and the contractor’s control should be taken into account. In general, Sweeten renovators report that their kitchen renovations are completed between three weeks to two months (depending on the level of complexity). The key to staying on track is isolating the steps that you think might be obstacles and allotting more time to get them done.</p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">Typically, a kitchen remodel will take anywhere from three weeks to four months to complete, depending on several factors, including the project complexity, the size of your kitchen, and your requested scope of work. Timelines may be extended for reasons like delays in material delivery, change orders, and discoveries unearthed during demo or construction (such as leaks, mold, or faulty wiring.)</p>

<h3>Scheduling your remodel on the calendar</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How long does a bathroom renovation take? Sweeten general contractors say the construction period will average 20–30 working days. Overall, a renovation can take between six weeks to three months, from planning to punch list. If you plan to move plumbing or electrical wiring, be prepared to apply for city permits and board approvals. They are the biggest culprits for delaying renovations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten offers the following step-by-step breakdown of a typical bath renovation. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3><strong>PRE-CONSTRUCTION PHASE</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The visual elements of the bathroom might get most of your attention. However, there&#8217;s behind-the-scenes work to be done before anyone picks up a sledgehammer.</p>
<h3>STEP 1: Close on your property (1-3 months)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While some renovators already own, a significant number of homeowners are in contract or preparing to close on a property when they begin planning a renovation. You should wait <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/dos-donts-closing-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">until you have closed</a> on the property, with keys in hand, before doing anything. If you’re in a hurry, wait until you’ve at least signed the contract before beginning the design process.</p>
<h3>STEP 2: Post your project (1-3 days)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Post your project</a> to Sweeten and begin inviting general contractors to bid. On the Sweeten site, add the details about the space you want to renovate, your inspiration photos (optional but useful), and any other information that would help in finding your perfect contractor. You will receive three contractor recommendations right away. Read the reviews and photos of past projects on the contractors’ profiles. Narrow down the contractors you&#8217;d like to discuss your project with.</p>
<h3>STEP 3: Schedule site visits and solicit bids (1-3 weeks)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An on-site visit is the best way for a contractor to understand the scope of the project, the physical possibilities, and the limitations of the space. It&#8217;s also a chance for the two of you to see if your personalities and communication style mesh. After you schedule your on-site visit, read this post on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to prepare</a> for the meeting. Depending on scope size, you should expect a written bid 5-7+ business days after your visit.</p>
<h3>STEP 4: Level bids and choose a contractor (1-2 weeks)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once all the written bids have come in, it’s time to compare and contrast. Sweeten can help walk you through them, both Sweeten and non-Sweeten estimates. This primer on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leveling bids</a> might come in handy. If you have follow-up questions, now is the time to ask. We suggest you schedule a free call with Sweeten to walk you through the various bids and weigh in on the selections.</p>
<h3>STEP 5: Sign contract and finalize construction schedule (1 week)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve decided on a contractor, they will put together a contract for you to review. This will typically include a description of the work to be done, an outline of costs, as well as the timing of payments throughout the project.</p>
<h3>STEP 6: Obtain permits and approvals (ranges widely)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of all the steps that might cause delays, this is the big one. Obtaining the correct permits and board approvals have held up many a renovation. However, our contractors are experienced in navigating these processes. They can advise you on how best to achieve your renovation goals with the least amount of hassle. Moving plumbing or gas lines requires an architect and additional DOB permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten homeowners have reported obtaining approvals in as little as two weeks—but it’s more common for it to take a couple of months. If you live in a stand-alone house, you won’t need to worry about building board approvals. However, you’ll still need the requisite city permits for any electrical or plumbing work to make sure that everything is up to code.</p>
<h3>STEP 7: Source materials (ranges widely)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are responsible for sourcing all or some of the materials in your renovation, be sure to place the orders as soon as the design plan is finished. Certain items have long lead times, and you don’t want that tub to hold up the entire renovation. If time is a concern, look at what’s currently in stock and ready to ship. Speak with your contractor about timing the product delivery to coincide with installation.</p>
<h3>STEP 8: Tell your neighbors (15 minutes)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be a good neighbor and warn yours that a renovation is beginning imminently. Tell them what to expect and how long the project is slated to last. It’s always easier to withstand the disruption when you know there’s an end in sight. It doesn’t hurt to bring a bottle of wine or a gift card from a local coffee shop.</p>
<h3>CONSTRUCTION PHASE</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: While most of the steps under “Construction” are your contractor’s responsibility, it’s important to understand what should be happening and when. The most important steps you’ll be in charge of are making scheduled payments to your contractor (outlined in your contract). Keeping your schedule open for several hours a week to answer questions about details or changes that come up over the course of construction.</p>
<h3>STEP 9: It’s demo time (1 day)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Out with the old! Now that you’re done with the paperwork, it’s time for demolition. Be sure to protect the items that are staying with tarp or plastic. Depending on how large your bathroom is, and how extensive the renovation is, this shouldn’t take more than four hours.</p>
<h3>STEP 10:  Reroute plumbing and electrical (1-2 days)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After you’ve stripped the space down to the studs, it’ll be easy to get new plumbing and wiring where it needs to go. Consider whether any plans need to be altered now that you can see what’s behind the walls.</p>
<h3>STEP 11: City inspections and sign-offs (1 hour on-site)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you needed city permits, you may need inspections and a sign-off before closing up the walls, and a final sign-off as well. While it may take the inspector an hour to do his job at the site, scheduling the actual appointment could take days or weeks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A master plumber is typically allowed to sign off on pipework for water lines in the case of a no-show by the city inspector. However, an inspector must examine and approve any work on gas lines. You are not allowed to close up the walls and move on to the next phase of the project before this inspection happens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: With electrical work, inspectors generally are scheduled for visits once the project is 100 percent complete, and they will check the electrical panel, junction boxes, and outlets. Sometimes, because of city bureaucracy and delays, your electrical inspection may be rescheduled two or three times. Check with your contractor or architect about what your project requires.</p>
<h3>STEP 12: Installation &#8211; floor tiles (½ &#8211; 1 day)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To prevent having to redo the flooring if you decide to reconfigure your space in the future, make sure that the flooring is consistent throughout the space, even if some of it will be hidden.</p>
<h3>STEP 13: Installation completion (1-3 days)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation of everything else, including the tub, vanity and sink, toilet, and any built-in shelving. Tiling, lighting, and hardware usually come last.</p>
<h3>STEP 14: Clean-up (1 day)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, contracts state that the space will be left in “broom-swept” condition. However, you may want to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/clean-up-after-major-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hire post-construction cleaning specialists</a> to make sure that your new floor is spic-and-span clean. For a bathroom renovation, consider having the service clean your entire home since construction dust tends to settle in the most unlikely places.</p>
<h3>POST-CONSTRUCTION PHASE</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The finish line is in sight. But don’t forget these last—but important—steps.</p>
<h3>STEP 15: Final walk-through with the contractor (30 minutes)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Review the work with your contractor. Try all the drawers and doors, look closely at the edges and grout lines, and make sure everything is working the way it should. If there are any problems, point them out and add them to the punch list. The contractor will either fix it on the spot (if it’s minor) or set up another time to return. Sweeten&#8217;s founder and CEO, Jean Brownhill, advises to keep notepads in each space, and to not speak to your contractor for two weeks after project completion. Spend time living with the space and taking notes whenever you discover something that needs a fix or an adjustment.</p>
<h3>STEP 16: Punch list items (1-5 days)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on what the items are—anything from straightening a cabinet door to waiting on installing that last out-of-stock item—it could take anywhere from a day to several weeks. When it’s on the long side, though, that is usually due to backordered items. Otherwise, your contractor should be able to return and fix everything in a few days.</p>
<h3>STEP 17: The final payment (10 minutes)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You’ve been making installments throughout the renovation. When the last item on your punch list has been addressed, the remaining payments are made to your contractor.</p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">Count on it taking <strong>3-1/2 to 10 weeks</strong>, assuming you don’t run into delays with permits or sourcing materials. This includes <strong>2 to 8 weeks of pre-construction</strong> (contractor hiring process, sourcing materials, and obtaining permits). This is followed by <strong>20 to 30 days of actual construction</strong> (demolition, inspections and sign-offs, installations, and clean-up). Finally, there are <strong>1 to 5 days of post-construction</strong> (walk-through with the contractor, fixes and adjustments, and final payment).</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Welcome to #8 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p><em>Feel free to email me at <strong><a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a></strong> with any reno questions or dilemmas you&#8217;d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>When should I start planning for my renovation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>A lot of homeowners come to us when they are in contract on a new property, but haven&#8217;t closed yet. This is a good time to start some preliminary planning, such as outlining the scope of the project—what you&#8217;re aiming to accomplish—and begin selecting materials. However, you really need to wait until you&#8217;ve closed on the property in order to pull permits, get board approval (if necessary), and have easy access to the space for walkthroughs and measuring—all the things that you&#8217;ll need to do to start your renovation.</p>
<p>You might also meet with a general contractor, but keep in mind that close dates sometimes don&#8217;t happen and there&#8217;s a chance the property sale may fall through. It&#8217;s a little harder to get general contractors to come on a site visit at this stage of purchase. It&#8217;s also a challenge to get access to the property. While in contract, we highly recommend starting to plan what you would want to renovate and the level of costs you want to spend on your materials, including your &#8220;must-haves&#8221; and &#8220;nice-to-haves.&#8221; We can&#8217;t emphasize enough how having a good handle on these aspects affect timing and delivery lead times, keeping your project on schedule.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>You’ve got big dreams and big plans—but are you actually ready to start your home renovation?<i></i></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-56822 size-full" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dos-donts-closing-renovating.jpg" alt="Facade of a house before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dos-donts-closing-renovating.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dos-donts-closing-renovating-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dos-donts-closing-renovating-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So you’re in the process of buying a home and you&#8217;re already making renovation plans. Congratulations! This is an exciting time and we understand you&#8217;re eager to get going right away. Sweeten outlines the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts of closing on a home and planning a renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> <span class="s1">matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>The big question: When&#8217;s the right time to start talking to contractors and design professionals?</h3>
<p><b></b><strong>A.</strong> When you make an offer?<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><strong>B.</strong> When you have an accepted offer?<br />
<strong>C.</strong> When you have an accepted offer and a deal sheet from your broker?<br />
<strong>D.</strong> When your attorney is preparing the contract and conducting a due diligence review of the property and building?<br />
<strong>E.</strong> When you have a signed contract and the deposit has changed hands?<br />
<strong>F.</strong>  After you close?<br />
<strong>G.</strong> When the condo, co-op board or town DOB approves the plans?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We talked to James Jantarasami, a New York attorney with expertise in housing and real estate to explore the question. James walked us through a few do’s and don&#8217;ts of buying a home and renovating.</p>
<h3>Own your property before finding a contractor.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DON’T</strong> shop around for a contractor before you have a place. Maybe this is obvious, but we sometimes see prospective owners jump the gun and try to interview contractors about a theoretical project. You will not be able to have a productive conversation with an architect, designer, or general contractor without knowing the exact details about the space you will be undertaking. Don’t start this conversation without an existing layout.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>DON’T</strong> look for a contractor at the offer stage. </span><span class="s1">An <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced general contractor</a> can put together a detailed estimate in 1–2 weeks. Many will only commit to that pricing for 30 days. Therefore, finding a contractor at the offer stage is too early in the process. </span></p>
<h4>Start bid leveling when in contract</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are &#8220;in contract&#8221; to buy a place, you can bring your architect or contractor to take measurements and start planning. However, in order to begin the work, you’ll need certainty of ownership, confirmation of condo or co-op building requirements, and confirmation of your city or town&#8217;s department of buildings’ requirements. All building and city or town DOB requirements have to be satisfied whether you’re buying a condo, co-op, or a single-family home in the suburbs.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Make the most of your time when “in contract,” since access to the home is readily available. Set up site visits with general contractors and receive at least three estimates. This will provide you with a low, medium, and high bid with some variation in services. Just as important, meeting multiple contractors allows you to view different personalities and to experience who would be the best fit as a collaborative partner. Sweeten’s </span><span class="s2">in-house team can provide personal support in breaking down and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comparing renovation bids</a> (both Sweeten and non-Sweeten).</span></p>
<h3>Start your designing after contract</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DON’T</strong> start designing until, at a minimum, you are already in contract and the deposit has changed hands. Anything can happen between an accepted offer and a signed contract. You don’t want to spend money on design only to have the purchase fall through. The safest play is to wait until closing before you engage an architect or design pro. But, if you can’t wait, a signed contract at least gives you a reasonable expectation that you are going to own the property.</p>
<h3>Wait for the board approval process to complete</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DON’T</strong> touch anything until you have closed and formally own the property, have approval from your city or town’s DOB, and have made it through the approval process with the building’s board for co-op and condo purchases. No major alterations and no cosmetic changes until the deed changes hands and all paperwork is signed!</p>
<h3>Consider renovation costs</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DO</strong> consider your home renovation plans before you make your offer. As a prospective purchaser, you can build the cost of the work needed into your offering price. <span class="s2">Check out Sweeten’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation cost guides</a> to factor into your overall budget. </span><span class="s1"> Alternatively, ask the s</span>eller to handle some renovations or repairs before you close as part of the offer negotiation. However, keep in mind that this is rarely a viable option (unless the seller is a developer). Most sellers aren’t going to be interested in doing home renovation work prior to closing. Even if they are, you’ll have to be willing to wait potentially months for permits and sign-offs to be obtained prior to closing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If your seller agrees to handle a few upgrades, you might save time and effort by letting them navigate the building’s and/or DOB’s requirements and completing the work before you close. The same goes if you&#8217;re purchasing a single-family home. But instead of dealing with a building&#8217;s requirements, the seller will only need to meet the DOB’s requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If your seller agrees to a discount so that you can cover certain repairs or renovations, you’ll need to handle the logistics and wait until you close. Having control over the process means you and the seller can avoid disagreements over the quality of the renovated work.</p>
<h3>Plan for delays in the process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DO</strong> plan for delays and variables during the contract and closing process. Delays from the lender are one of the most common reasons a closing stalls. Condo and co-op board approvals can also add a month or more to your closing date, and you’ll still need approval from your city or town’s DOB. If you’re buying a single-family home, you’ll only need approval from the local DOB, so there’s one less step for you as the buyer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your attorney should be looking at everything that can go wrong: debts or liens against the seller, judgments or mortgages against the home, damage to the home that occurs between contract signing and closing (a water leak, floor or wall damage, appliance issues, etc.). If buying a condo or co-op, watch for any fiscal problems in a building’s financial reports that might spook the lender. Hopefully, none of these issues will derail the closing altogether, but you won’t be able to begin any work until all signatures are in.</p>
<h3>Will you need accommodations?</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>DO</b> budget for the in-between time. Since you can’t start home renovation work on a new home until you close, you may need to find another place to live while work is underway, or account for a period of time without rental income if you are renovating before tenants move in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So to recap, when can you start truly planning your renovation? The correct answer (in most cases) is E.  This means that generally, you can start:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Designing once you are in contract</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Building once you close and have official approval from your city or town’s DOB
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If you have a co-op or condo, you will also need to get approval from your governing board</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’ve closed on a new place (congrats!) and are ready to find your general contractor, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project</a> on Sweeten to get started!</p>
