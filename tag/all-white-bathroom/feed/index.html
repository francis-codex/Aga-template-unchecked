<p><i style="text-align: justify;">Looking for a &#8220;bring your architect&#8221; wreck, Jerry and Janet fell for a brownstone with a stately presence and a virtually unsalvageable interior. <em>The couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> and found </em><em>a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect</a> and a Sweeten general contractor to restore the once-glorious home. </em></i><i style="text-align: justify;">Read on down to see how this couple honored the building&#8217;s original architecture and also made room for modern conveniences and an almost-all-IKEA kitchen!</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Historic brownstone, close to trains, and a (relatively) affordable neighborhood. These were our criteria when we selected Crown Heights as our new home. A few years ago, we had moved out of the city to Long Island, but immediately missed our friends and the shorter commute. Janet, who runs the New York School of Design, a fashion design school, wanted to have input on the layout and fittings of our new home. So we decided to limit our search to townhouses that needed a gut renovation. We only looked at listings which included the term “bring your architect”—you know the type.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After many open houses and a fierce bidding war, we were given the keys to a four-family brownstone that “had good bones” but needed a little TLC. During our initial walk-through as new homeowners, it suddenly hit us—the prospect of such a big renovation was really daunting! We used <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matched us to our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architects</a>. Sweeten also suggested three different contractors who each made proposals. We chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3438" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our general contractor </a>and together, we got started.</p>
<p>The goal of our townhouse renovation was to create the perfect mix of old and new. We loved pre-war architecture and wanted to preserve as much of the original detail as possible. During this process, we worked with our architect to think of ways to match the original detail with newer materials. We wanted to rethink the apartment layouts and convert the two-bedroom units to large one bedrooms. In addition to updating the kitchens and baths, we hoped that an open layout would feel brighter and more spacious. Due to budget and timing, we decided to renovate the four apartments in two phases. At the time of this blog post, two apartments are finished. We are currently living in one of them and preparing to rent it out after the other units are complete.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39968" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the demo phase, a lot of time was spent assessing what could be restored and what needed to go. The contractor tried to salvage the original ceiling medallions, but they crumbled once the nearby popcorn ceilings were removed. In the kitchen, it was a pleasant surprise when we found excellent condition hardwood floor underneath the linoleum. We were elated when we discovered that the stairways were in great condition and could be refinished (apparently, new stairs are very expensive). It was a rough day when we found out that the main supporting beam for the building (wooden and over 100 years old) needed to be replaced with a steel beam—a big unforeseen expense. But we were thankful that the general contractor was meticulous and didn’t take any shortcuts in safety.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39972 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39976 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-08.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />After demo, we then installed new electrical, plumbing, and gas heating. Next came the framing of the walls to create the new floor plan. The layout is what really makes the apartment special. We joined the living room and an adjacent closet so that the entire area is larger. This created a small alcove, which is now a quiet sitting area bathed in natural light. The living room then flows into the kitchen and dining area. Eight-foot French doors separate the kitchen from the bedroom. The doors, even when closed, allow more light to flow into the apartment.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The kitchen was very important to us. We like to cook, so we really wanted extra counter space and built-in butcher block. Gray cabinetry and shelving were arranged to maximize storage space, and we incorporated mixed-material countertops, as well as a sink, fridge, and dishwasher—all from IKEA. We chose a counter-depth refrigerator, which fit perfectly into </span>the space<span style="color: #333333;">. A geometric </span>tile<span style="color: #333333;"> backsplash brings it all together.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom is large enough for a king-size bed. We kept the existing wall between the kitchen and bedroom but converted the old kitchen into a dressing room. The dressing room is Janet&#8217;s favorite space. It has a huge closet, room for seating, and a full-sized washer and dryer. The bathroom has two entrances—one from the kitchen/dining area and a pocket door from the dressing room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The window moldings and crowns are all original. We decided to paint them black to contrast with the lighter wall colors. All the doors are original and were reconditioned and adjusted to fit properly. We chose egg-shaped door knobs. Picture rail moldings and new ceiling medallions were added. In the hallways, we restored the original wainscoting and created new panels to fill in missing or damaged areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39967" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="668" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-05-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />(<em>Above</em>) Existing kitchen becomes the dressing room</p>

<p>The bathroom was also designed to mix old and new. We chose a sink and toilet that would go well with the traditional fixtures. For added towel storage, we installed a separate rack. We chose to use elongated tiles, a twist on the traditional subway tiles. The matte texture of the hexagon floor tiles feels amazing on bare feet!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The building exterior also underwent a facelift. We first removed the &#8217;70s screen door and awning. The exterior cornice was repainted black, allowing its architectural detail to shine. We chose a color called &#8220;Velvet Plum&#8221; for the main exterior. We splurged and replaced the front door with historically-accurate mahogany double doors. While this was not cheap, it’s one of our favorite things about the building.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">All this sounds like a lot of work and it truly was. During the build-out phase, we had weekly walk-throughs with our architect and contractor. I realized that this was very important and ensured that the project progressed smoothly. Even though there were detailed architectural plans and specifications, there were often unforeseen circumstances that would require a quick decision. These meetings and open communication with the contractor helped avoid delays and insured that the build-out was to our liking. Because we watched as things were being done, we often gave last-minute input and even changed our minds about things a few times.</p>
<p>For those of you out there who are planning to do a similar project, I highly recommend that you be involved. I know it’s tempting to think, “Hey, I’m paying these people A LOT to do this for me and I just want to see the final result.” That’s understandable. But, although it’s time-consuming and a bit of a pain, I guarantee that you’ll get a better end result if you are involved in the process like we were. In addition, your choice of general contractor is extremely important. Since this was our first renovation, we had put a lot of trust in our team. We feel really fortunate that our contractor was honest and didn’t try to nickel and dime us on every little thing.</p>
<p>Looking back, we really didn’t know what we were getting into with such a big project (we blame cable TV renovation shows for misleading us). But, fortunately, with guidance from our architect and general contractor, the process ended up to be very positive. We absolutely love our new home!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Renovating for resale in Brooklyn: a kitchen and bath remodel enjoyed by current &amp; future homeowners</h2>
<h2><i style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heather and Doug&#8217;s 1980s South Slope condo was in need of an update, but given the family’s eventual plans to move, they kept putting off a renovation. When DIY fixes (also known as “tape”) were no longer enough, it became clear that finally renovating for future resale was the way to go. The end result? A sunny, modern kitchen &amp; bath renovation that the family knows will bring resale value—and that they get to enjoy in the present. </span></i><i style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read on for Heather’s take on major changes in two key spaces.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/all-eyes-on-resale-for-this-kitchen-and-bath-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-19324 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/heather-kitchen.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/heather-kitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/heather-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Heather, South Park Slope homeowner</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My husband, Doug, and I moved into our small condo in South Park Slope shortly after our daughter was born six years ago. The building had been abandoned in the 1970s and then turned into eight small condo units in the 1980s. We love the community, the location, and many things about our space, but the kitchen and bathroom had clearly not been updated since the original condo conversion. With our son, Elijah, and daughter, Alice, now sharing a bedroom, we knew that we would eventually need one more room, so we didn’t see any reason to renovate. But then the cupboards and the appliances began to give out. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I work at a book publishing company and telecommute, so I spend a lot of time working at the kitchen table and dreamed about ripping out our old kitchen cupboards. After one too many times reapplying duct tape to the fridge shelves and silverware drawer, we decided to take the plunge and renovate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19287 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" alt="sweeten_heather_kitchen_bathroom-before-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19286 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_heather_kitchen_bathroom-before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19285" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="sweeten_heather_kitchen_bathroom-before-01" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I loved reading the Sweeten renovation blogs and seeing the amazing transformation of other people’s homes. We had some recommendations for contractors from friends, but weren’t sure about the fit. So we </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">p</a><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">osted our project</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten and started to talk to contractors. What led us to choose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was his experience in renovating for resale. We were able to see some units that he was renovating in progress, and he had great suggestions for things to focus on for a possible sale in the future (like a dual showerhead, </span>which is really great for families with kids).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided on a classic, mostly white approach for the kitchen. Our plan was to add color with paint only, which would be easier for the next owners to change. With no edits to the layout or plumbing, we focused on choosing the materials that would make the most sense. We decided on Shaker-style cupboards from Home Depot and classic white subway tile for the kitchen backsplash from Nemo tile. Our counters are Caesarstone (from Appia Marble), the fridge is Samsung (from Home Depot), and the range is a Viking (from AJ Madison).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best changes was a little one: Previously, the stove was directly next to the sink. We added space between the sink and stove—having a place to rest a pot or put dirty plates out of view from people in the living room is very nice.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bathroom, we continued with the same subway tile from the kitchen for the walls, but veered from the “classic” plan on the floor tile. I loved the blue tile from Nemo and the idea of having a bright color in a classic herringbone pattern. No one was sure about this when we opened the box of tiles, but it is now our (and Lem’s) favorite part of the bathroom renovation. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given our short time frame, we ended up having to make many decisions quickly. But this made some of our choices less overwhelming. Instead of having 2,000 tubs to choose from, we would look at what was in stock (only 800!). While we spent quite a bit of time at big box stores and online, we also became acquainted with a few very helpful local places in our neighborhood that we will certainly go to again. I would encourage others doing a renovation to try to get a schedule of when cupboards, appliances, etc. will be needed (if not dates, then at what point in the process) because once you are</span> into the project, there is very little time to make decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since our apartment was too small to live in with a renovation underway, we planned to move out for five weeks over the summer to accommodate the work. Everything went fairly smoothly, and Lem made sure that the apartment was ready for us to move back into on schedule. Given how small and close-knit our building is, I was very concerned about the renovation being disruptive for our neighbors. Lem took great care to cover the floor and other parts of the apartment so the noise wasn’t too much for our downstairs neighbors, and so that dust didn’t invade other parts of our apartment. All of the workers were respectful of our space, the building, and our neighbors, which meant a lot to us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few add-on items that we chose not to do because we didn&#8217;t want to spend more money. One was having all of the outlets changed to new, stainless steel ones with USB ports. I plan to do this myself but wonder when that is going to happen. It probably would have been worth it to go ahead. The other was to have our floors redone. It seemed like too much to manage at the time, but now that the kitchen and bath look so nice, I notice how other parts of the apartment look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We LOVE our renovated space. The kitchen not only looks better, but it is infinitely easier to use and we have more storage space. It is amazing to have a real size fridge. The bathroom is also much more functional and looks bright and clean (even when it is not totally). Our old appliances in both the kitchen and the bathroom were energy intensive, and it was important to me to get an energy-efficient fridge and a low-flow toilet. They are little things in the bigger picture, but make me feel a little bit better about our environmental footprint.</p>
