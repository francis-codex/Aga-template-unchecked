										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A two-family becomes a single home for a couple and their furry friends</h2>
<p><em>Carol and Jon felt as if they’d won the lottery when they found their first home, a charming, two-story detached place—gray with black shutters, built in 1926—on the western edge of Jersey City. While Jon, a lawyer working with startups, and Carol, who does policy work for a national homelessness nonprofit, had great ideas for renovating, they knew this house would be a challenge: It was an up-down duplex and their dream was to turn it into a single-family residence. But with Sweeten&#8217;s help, the renovation turned out great—and was even featured in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/28/couple-crafts-delightful-bunny-mansion-for-their-beloved-pets/">New York Post</a>. </em></p>

<em>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Carol</em></p>
<p>This was the very first house we toured and it had everything we wanted, including a backyard, driveway, and garage. Best of all, it was around the corner from my beloved <em>tia</em> (Spanish for &#8220;aunt&#8221;), so we can have coffee with her every day. We loved our home, but there were challenges: the electrical had to be upgraded and we had to move radiators around to accommodate the kitchen renovation.</p>

<p>With the ultimate goal to make two spaces into one cohesive home, we knew we’d need to save money. So when we first moved in, we made just a few aesthetic changes. We painted the entire space, including the kitchen cabinets, and we had a family friend remove not one, but two drop ceilings in the kitchen. We added a few new light fixtures and fabulous bunny wallpaper from Anthropologie.</p>
<p>We decided to play the role of landlord, living on the first floor of the house with our four rabbits and three cats while we <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/renovate-your-rental-property-wisely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rented out the top floor</a>. We knew that the renovation process would take time, money and patience, but that it would be worth it.</p>

<p>After two years of saving, we were ready to take on the full renovation. We browsed Sweeten&#8217;s Instagram page for inspiration, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27631" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten,</a> and were matched with an amazing contractor. He really helped this not-so-handy couple transform our kitchen into the perfect space to cook and entertain, and prepare the rest of the house for the next renovation phase: turning the house from a double to a single-family home.</p>
<p>During the renovation, we moved into the upstairs unit and lived without a stove with our seven pets, as well as a cat and her two kittens we were fostering for JerseyCats, a local cat rescue. We weren&#8217;t prepared for the renovation to take as long as it did. We started demolition at the end of March and finished early August. Waiting for permits held stuff up a lot. We were sort of over the whole process very quickly. Fortunately, our contractor was always there to help.</p>

Have I mentioned the bunny wallpaper? Early in our relationship, Jon was in law school and I was in graduate school. We thought bunnies would be low-maintenance pets. HA! Now, we can&#8217;t get enough.</p>
<p>We also wanted to increase storage and counter space and create direct access to the backyard through the kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37766 mb-0 size-full" title="hallway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-08.jpg" alt="New Jersey, Jersey City, renovation, two family, remodel, one family, hallway, wallpaper, bunny" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>To enlarge the kitchen, we tore down a wall and took space from an existing bedroom. One of my must-haves was a big kitchen island. I love to cook and host parties for my friends and family, and everyone always ends up in the kitchen. I kept imagining a huge island surrounded by those I love. I really wanted it to be different and for the cabinets underneath (and the lower perimeter cabinets) to be colorful. I&#8217;ve been going through a green phase. I came across swatches of Benjamin Moore Pine Green and was immediately inspired. I’ll admit, I&#8217;m obsessed with the island.</p>

The contractor also created a new door out of an existing window that allowed direct access to the backyard. For more storage, he came up with the double-door pantry, knowing I wanted enough space for my microwave and all of my cooking appliances.</p>

He took charge of redesigning the entry foyer and exposing an existing staircase, which had been hidden behind a wall. Removing that wall and adding a banister made the two-family feel disappear. We are now able to go upstairs without having to go through the foyer.</p>
