										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">A developer&#8217;s dark style is transformed by its new owner with high-gloss cabinets, drawers turned sideways, and a comfy window seat</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24340 mb-0 size-chrono" title="window seat" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-Portrait-723x1085.jpg" alt="window seat" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</b></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redesign a kitchen</a> with a bright sheen in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: There was much to love about the two-bedroom condo in Bed-Stuy that Ursula, a math teacher, recently purchased. The developer, who had just converted a brownstone into four apartments, did a good job. However, the brand new kitchen just wasn’t her style. The dark mahogany cabinets and kitchen island weighed it down as did the floorboards of a similar color. The cabinets above the range also gave the space a claustrophobic feel. “The developer seemed to have an imagination when it came to painting. The walls were blue and yellow and very specific to his taste,” said Ursula.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>After</b></span>: Since her new apartment only has windows on the front and back, Ursula used <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, <span class="s1">a free service matching homeowners with general contractors to </span>tap her Sweeten contractor and harness that light. So out went the dark cabinets. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wood floors</a> were stripped and restained. To open up the kitchen, the cabinets and microwave above the range were out, too (“it just isn’t a pretty appliance,” said Ursula, speaking of microwaves). In their place is now a sleek <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hood</a>. With the space more open, the hexagonal tiles chosen for the backsplash became a focal point. “I think it must be the math teacher in me, but there is just something about them that I love,” she said. A &#8220;dresser&#8221;-style <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island</a> features three drawers for silverware, cutlery, dishes, and some pots and pans. &#8220;My beech cutting board is always on top of the kitchen island for food prep,&#8221; says Ursula. &#8220;It is conveniently in front of the oven, so I just have to turn around to cook.&#8221; The storage unit&#8217;s glossy gray tone offers contrast to the mostly white space. Her Sweeten contractor also utilized every inch of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinet space</a> including a stubborn area next to the oven. There, a drawer installed on its side—a cabinet wouldn&#8217;t fit—became a convenient <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pull-out spice rack</a>. As for the microwave, a much smaller one is hidden in the upper cabinets.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: Ursula&#8217;s Sweeten contractor used the same kitchen cabinet system from Ikea to create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bench seat</a> near the window. Now, there’s more storage space and extra seating for when guests come over. “That&#8217;s one of my favorite areas in the apartment because it is a little unexpected,” she says. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">From ranges and dishwashers to refrigerators, here are appliances that fit small-space kitchens like a (rubber) glove</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23398 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Manhattan kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-723x485.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02" width="723" height="485" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-723x485.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-600x402.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></span><span class="img-label"> (Above) A 24&#8243; Bertazzoni range in Pallavi and Keyur&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/pallavi-keyurs-manhattan-apartment-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manhattan renovation</a></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the size of their kitchen, most homeowners feel it could be larger. But what if your kitchen is </span><span class="s1"><i> really </i></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">small? Depending on the room’s dimensions—a narrow galley kitchen or even a trim 12- by 12-foot box shape—appliances in particular can seem to overwhelm a space and throw everything out of proportion. Thankfully, manufacturers have responded to this dilemma with smaller-size appliances that still offer the function you want while not overwhelming the space. What’s more, you may find the smaller kitchen, with most everything in arm’s reach, is actually more efficient and thus a happier, more productive place to cook. And with so many major manufacturers on this bandwagon, you don’t have to sacrifice style, either. P.S.: If you have a large kitchen, this is good news, too, providing the opportunity to fit an additional cook surface or fridge, or turn a walk-in pantry into an additional prep space. Read on:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layout in a triangle</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For any kitchen to work well, the layout must be planned for top efficiency. In a small cookspace, appliances in close proximity mean fewer steps and better conservation of movement and energy. Follow the classic kitchen triangle: place the functions of cooking, cooling and washing—stove, fridge, and sink—so that if you draw a line from each one to the other, you create a triangle. This means you will have allowed some landing space next to each of these features, and separation, too, to avoid a collision if two people share the kitchen. Once your floor plan is a go, you can choose the appliances that will do the job you want—and also fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cooking with mini power</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have your heart set on a range, more than a few manufacturers will accommodate you with a compact 24-inch model that allows four burners and an oven, too, of course. <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueStar</a> makes a range in an industrial style that isn’t the size of an SVU but still packs loads of cooking power. If you’re comfortable with classic style, look for a vintage 21-inch O’Keefe and Merritt, a model created when small kitchens were the only way to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Need to go smaller still? You can find two-burner radiant and induction cooktops from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.kitchenaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KitchenAid</a> or <a href="https://www.geappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE</a> in widths starting at 15 inches. Then place the oven on the wall to free up more undercounter space for a slim dishwasher (more on this below). Also check out combo ovens that offer microwave as well as convection (one less appliance!), available from most manufacturers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t overlook range hoods; these come smaller, too, to top off their cooking cousins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21380 mb-10 size-chrono" title="small space appliances" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08-723x1085.gif" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
<span class="img-label"> (Above) An undercounter refrigerator (left of the sink) and 24&#8243; range in Emily&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upper West Side renovation</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Compact cooling </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Refrigeration of smaller stature has come a long way since the top-mount model in your starter apartment. Manufacturers such as <a href="https://www.vikingrange.com/consumer/category/products/refrigeration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking</a> make a model as slim as 30 inches, which can still stow a tray of appetizers. Need to go slimmer still? <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a>, LG, and GE each offer a stainless-steel bottom freezer refrigerator that measures 24 inches wide. If you don’t tend to stock a lot for daily meals, a refrigerator drawer (or two) is an alternative, and can be found from Thermador, <a href="https://www.monogram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE Monogram</a>, or Electrolux for as small as 24 inches wide by 34 ¼ inches high. Plus, the elimination of another swinging door helps reduce the feeling of clutter, easing traffic jams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undercounter fridges that still have a door are also available from companies such as KitchenAid, Frigidaire, Kenmore, and <a href="https://www.whirlpool.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whirlpool</a>. You can get a nice long run of counterspace if you keep all your appliances under the counter, which will make the overall space look less cluttered and hence feel larger.</span></p>
<p><strong>Washing in small batches</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The standard dishwasher comes 24 inches wide, and that will fit in most galley kitchens. But if you wish to go smaller, Frigidaire, Bosch, and Kenmore make models as narrow as 18 inches—just what you need to handle a day’s dishes. Or consider a dishwasher drawer like those from <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel</a>. Typically available at 24 inches wide, these versions can handle dishware for a party of six, but if that’s not how you dine every day, then it’s not a major issue anyway.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Here’s a primer on this traditional appliance, but don’t be fooled—telescopic racks, smart technology, and French doors make it a modern kitchen helper</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">A wall oven is a very handy appliance in the kitchen, even if you already have one in your range. It doubles your ability to bake, broil or roast, especially important if you entertain frequently, like to cook ahead, or just want to host the holidays with more ease. What’s more, with a wall oven, you enjoy more flexibility with regard to placement, not only for its location in the cook space, but also height.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Wall ovens have seen a lot of advances since the last time you shopped. While you can anticipate the one you choose will operate more accurately and efficiently than previous models, you can also expect to find super-sleek styling, sophisticated digital controls to help you find just the right setting for everything, and of course, self-cleaning. Here’s a rundown of what to look for:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choose your heat source</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Probably your first decision will be gas or electric. Your choice will be based on the type of power you already have in your home. Most manufacturers still offer gas, which provides a lower-priced alternative to electric, and more of a moist heat. With electric, the temperature coming from the coils can be controlled more precisely than a gas flame, and heat is radiated from both top and bottom elements. Electric ovens may also offer Sabbath mode, which allows continuous, safe operation over several days without having to turn the appliance off and on.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Multiple sizes offer flexibility</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Unless you’re replacing an existing oven and so locked into specific dimensions, you have some flexibility here, too. While the most common width is 30 inches, many manufacturers offer 27-inch and 36-inch wall ovens, and you will find some at 24 inches as well as 48. Think about what and how you cook, as you need to consider the cubic-foot capacity, too. If you host the family Thanksgiving, you want an oven cavity large enough to handle that huge turkey. Sizes range from as low as 2 to as high as 5 cubic feet with an average about 4 cubic feet. A large turkey usually ranges from 24 to 26 lbs and can fit into a 30&#8243; oven with 5 cubic feet of interior space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Go convection</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Available in both gas and electric, a convection oven uses fans to circulate hot air within the oven cavity for faster baking and roasting, as well as the most even cooking. Your wall oven should be able to alternate between conventional and convection, as you wish, but some double ovens may offer one unit convection and the other conventional.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Don’t forgo convenience</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Who doesn’t want a microwave oven, even if it’s just for reheating soup or coffee? If space is an issue in your kitchen, consider a wall oven that includes a separate microwave, typically on top. It resembles a double wall oven, but not so tall.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cooking on the double</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In the ’70s, it seemed every kitchen (at least those on TV shows) had double wall ovens and a matching cooktop in avocado or harvest gold. While these color choices have been replaced by stainless steel or a return to classic white or ivory, the convenience of double ovens is worth examining. You get double the function, as mentioned above; while a single convection oven lets you cook simultaneously on multiple racks, a double oven permits simultaneous operation at different temperatures (great when you want the roasted Brussels sprouts to be ready at the same time as the broiled chicken, or to have a pie come out of the oven just as you are finishing dinner). It’s also cheaper than two individual wall ovens (unless you have, say, a kosher kitchen and need to keep the ovens in separate places). Just be sure to plan an adequate landing surface nearby to handle multiple hot dishes that may be ready at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stay low-maintenance</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">What did we do before self-cleaning came along? Perhaps this is where the term “elbow grease” originated. In the past, you had to remove the racks and clean them by hand. Check with your salesperson, as some models now allow you to leave the racks inside while cleaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Warming selection</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The warming drawer option first came on strong about 20 years ago, then interest tapered off as wall ovens hit the market with super-low heat and steam features that basically did the same thing. For households where family members eat at different times, or who often host a crowd, and for kosher kitchens, a warming drawer is still a handy appliance worth making room for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Other fun features</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Bells and whistles come at a price, but you may want to justify it for the added convenience, control, and safety (not to mention time) you gain. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">*Operation modes have expanded beyond self-cleaning to control lock, as well as delay start and cook and hold—terrific for busy lifestyles! Even the broil function offers some variability to adjust for foods with different requirements, like the golden brown bread crumb topping or the blackened seasoned sirloin steak.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">*Doors are making a statement, too. You’re used to grabbing the handle at the top and peering in while you dodge a blast of hot air to check the progress of your food, right? Manufacturers have responded to this practice by offering larger viewing windows. You can also find wall ovens where the door opens from the side, as well as French doors. A stylistic choice, they’re also ADA compliant, so you may also find it easier to access a dish inside with one of these types of doors (expect to pay a bit more).</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">*Investigate the racking systems. You’ll hear a term “telescopic,” which refers to a system whereby the rack extends fully with ball-bearing rack guides, to prevent tipping when removing heavy items.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">—</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">For an even more functional and flexible cook space, why not take inspiration from the past and pair your new wall oven with a cooktop?
