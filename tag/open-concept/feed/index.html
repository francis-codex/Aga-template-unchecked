<h3>A full gut renovation</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When we purchased our apartment, we knew that we were going to renovate it.  As someone who loves design, I saw the potential and welcomed the opportunity to take a space and figure out how to best make it work for our family of five including three boys (and two dogs). I did not, however, anticipate we would be undertaking a full gut renovation—and while we had renovated before, those projects were a much smaller scope.</span></p>

<h3>Working with an architect</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before we closed on our apartment, we began working with our <a href="https://www.jwarchitecturedpc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect Jessica Wetters</a> on how to change the layout of the apartment. The plan was to open it up and improve the light and flow. The living spaces would be connected as well as add a bedroom and a half-bathroom. It was clear to our architect that the apartment required a full-gut renovation and that little could be saved. After a few rounds of revising the plans, we arrived at a layout that achieved our objectives.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13.jpg" alt="hallway" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44266" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Finding the right contractor</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before we found Sweeten, we began working with a contractor on the budget for the project and costs kept going up. We were at the point where we were cutting parts of the project that were important to us (like millwork) and making compromises we weren’t comfortable with in order to stay within budget. I decided to post our project on Sweeten. It would allow me to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add more cost estimates into the mix</a> with their network of general contractors and see if I had unrealistic expectations. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg" alt="foyer" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44263" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4.jpg" alt="Henrybuilt kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44264" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sweeten matched us with three contractors, but after <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interviewing this general contractor</a>, I knew he was the one for our project. Not only did he assure us that he could get us everything we wanted within our budget, but he promised that he would minimize the disruption to our lives and work with our aggressive timeline.   </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5.jpg" alt="Henrybuilt kitchen" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44267" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As soon as we hired him, things moved quickly and once we had all of the necessary approvals, we moved into a rental apartment. Demolition began</span><span class="s2"> in February and work was completed over the summer. </span></p>

<h3>Functional and modern</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The first decision we made was the kitchen. I knew I wanted a Henrybuilt kitchen. I love the functionality and feel of our kitchen. We also planned for a black wall in the living room using huge porcelain tile slabs to camouflage our TV and it turned out even better than I expected. I researched industrial factory doors to connect the living room and bedrooms, but it was over-budget (even the reclaimed factory doors I saw were $7,000+) so I had a door made with a similar look for a small fraction of the cost.</span></p>

<h3>Replacing the floors</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In addition to opening up the kitchen, foyer, and living room, we enlarged the size of our master bathroom and added closets in unused space in the master bedroom. Throughout the apartment, we replaced the hardwood floors, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coated the walls</a>, replaced the trim, replaced all of the lighting, and added millwork.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">Even though we lived there without a kitchen which wasn’t optimal, there was no question that it would be worth it in the end. </span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When I told our Sweeten contractor that our rental ended in June and that we wanted to move back in before the apartment was completed, he worked with us to allow us to do that—despite his strong recommendation that we hold off moving in. Even though we lived there without a kitchen which wasn’t optimal—his crew set up a refrigerator in the middle of the apartment—there was no question that it would be worth it in the end. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-bathroom-16.jpg" alt="vertical shower tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44260" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-bathroom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-bathroom-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-bathroom-16-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3 class="p4">The perfect finished product</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When a couple of unexpected structural issues were discovered during demo that required changes to the layout, our contractor immediately contacted our architect and me and proposed solutions that ended up improving the project. Issues that could have induced panic and delays were addressed efficiently and proactively. Our contractor, our architect, and I met at the apartment nearly every week to discuss progress and make decisions to ensure that the project kept moving forward on schedule. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are thrilled with the results. We achieved exactly the look and feel we were going for and I firmly believe that the process went as smoothly and efficiently as it did, thanks to our contractor, his crew, and our architect.  </span></p>

</ul>
<h3>A home with potential</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s incredible what you can do to a house without knocking down a wall. We had to look beyond a lot of challenges, 40-year-old decor, </span><span class="s1">an antiquated electrical system, and thin, stained wooden floors. But we saw something we could work with.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42954 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait.jpg" alt="renovators on couch with dogs" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43007 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior.jpg" alt="exterior 1920s house remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house had a great layout. We loved the open first floor, with its nine-and-a-half-foot ceilings and perfect flow—the foyer, living room, and dining room were all open but the spaces were distinct. The second floor lacked overhead lighting and had wood paneling in every room, but was accessed by a beautiful staircase. Potential! We knew we could make it modern while preserving its ‘20s spirit.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42944 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors.jpg" alt="Black double French doors, living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42945 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway.jpg" alt="remodeled foyer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Hidden architectural designs</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not that it would be easy. The family we bought the house from had owned it for 34 years and it had a very retro feel. We hoped that the layers of carpet and wallpaper might conceal architectural delights, but were disappointed that the few special details we uncovered, like parquet inlays, were beyond salvaging.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We knew that foundational work would eat most of the budget, with the floors and walls requiring considerable attention.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The initial scope that we listed out for Sweeten offered a basic overview of our project, listing last: “</span><span class="s3">Inspect/clean electrical panel.” We mentioned the possible need to replace or expand it, but didn’t realize how much work it would actually require. Finding out that we needed to replace all of the wiring</span><span class="s1"> was one surprise that our renovation served up. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We scheduled walk-thoughs to see the work at various stages, including&#8230;the electrical portion. Seeing exactly what had been done before the walls were closed up was informative and reassuring.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42951 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3.jpg" alt="living room renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Combining the old with new</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We didn’t move or remove a single wall but we did add French doors in the foyer to create a barrier to summer heat and winter cold. Because most of the first floor is open concept, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interior doors help to keep</a> the temperature even and comfortable year-round, while also creating a dramatic entry into our living space. [See more <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/home/photo-gallery/45749027/image/45749041/Modern-Meets-Country">inspiring living rooms here</a>.]</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">One of our goals was to build in details that appeared original. Where we could, we blended the old with the new that included a molding update. We complemented the existing molding on the stairs with new molding on the adjacent wall. </span><span class="s1">Our contractor matched the living room ceiling to the dining room’s original trim and a ceiling medallion was installed, a hint at deco design. It was in this room that the house finally gave us a gift. Our contractor unearthed a window hidden inside the dining room exterior wall—a lovely find that, with some attention, brought us a lot more light.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42943 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg" alt="dining room remodeled" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Choosing the materials</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We stripped, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skim coated</a>, and painted the walls and redid two bathrooms investing in materials that would last. New floors were installed, windows were repaired, and energy-efficient ductless AC went throughout the house. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house felt instantly spacious and bright. The two things we were looking for in every choice we made: quality and classic style. From flooring and tiles to paint and different types of fixtures, we chose finishes we knew would last and look good for decades. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our color scheme, like everything else, is stark, graphic, and, most importantly, bright. White with the occasional swath of black feels timeless and pulls together everything from the foyer to the upstairs bath. A discreet beach vibe is there for those who look—low-key seashell references are hidden in a few small spots, a nod to the fact that we&#8217;re a 25-minute walk from Marine Park.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42955 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1.jpg" alt="Staircase remodel" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting things done to code</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We wound up doing nearly twice as much work and extending our schedule to four times the original plan. We spent a little over $120,000, including materials, a four-month apartment rental, and contractor costs. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">We were scrupulous about everything being done to code. Our Sweeten contractor had great communication skills and sent updates, photos, and videos via WhatsApp. We scheduled walk-throughs to see the work at various stages, including the point when the electrical portion was complete. Seeing exactly what had been done before the walls were closed up was informative and reassuring. As a civil engineer, Luke was heavily focused on ensuring that the electrical, plumbing, and structural elements were sound.</span></p>

<h3>An extensive renovation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This renovation taught us a lot! It wasn’t our first experience, but our biggest by far. We used many subcontractors, including electricians, HVAC specialists, plumbers, hardwood flooring installers, and plaster experts, and asked a lot of questions about the best processes, the ideal order for tasks, and how to complete them on a reasonable schedule. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The best part of the renovation? Seeing the “after” months later, after being so overwhelmed by the “before”! We didn’t gut the house, but we came close. The difference is dramatic. We are absolutely thrilled.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Project</b></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Reimagine a dated kitchen in the East Village</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: The homeowner bought an 860-square-foot apartment on the east side of Manhattan with the plan to renovate before moving in. He wanted the kitchen to be open to the rest of the apartment and give it a more contemporary look and feel. Functionally, the layout wasn’t working for him. The sink was small and in a strange location, and the stove and refrigerator were right next to each other. Cosmetically, the pine cabinets looked behind the times, as did the tile flooring and countertops. Ready to dive in, he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted his project to Sweeten</a> and was <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-Before-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38747 mb-0 size-full" title="oak-kitchen-cabinets-before-renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-Before-04.jpg" alt="oak kitchen cabinets and square tiles on floor and granite countertop and stainless steel appliances before renovation" width="1084" height="723" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-Before-04.jpg 1084w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-Before-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-Before-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-Before-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1084px) 100vw, 1084px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>After</b></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Creating an open concept living arrangement was the biggest goal. The dividing wall between the kitchen and family room came down and a custom unit with storage on both sides took its place. On the kitchen side, it hosts the integrated Sub-Zero refrigerator, while the other side holds pantry items and other essentials. Full-sized and quality appliances were a big priority. “They [general contractor team] worked with me through a few kitchen iterations until we found a great open layout that permitted full-size appliances,” the homeowner shared.</span></p>

Light gray lower cabinets contrasting with white uppers give the illusion of a higher ceiling. The homeowner opted for white quartz countertops and bamboo floors, an eco-friendly and durable option that’s easy to maintain and refinish when needed.</p>
<p>His contractor came across a few issues, including an immovable gas line. He worked around it, adding additional cabinets and storage space. The contractor also discovered the apartment couldn’t contain heat. “They adapted their design incorporating larger replacement radiators which are keeping the space nice and toasty as winter is approaching,” the homeowner shared. Because of the building’s age, there were cracks in the living room and bedroom walls, so the contractor repaired them and gave the homeowner a longer-term warranty. “They also skim-coated the entire place because the ceilings and walls were in bad shape.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-04.gif"><img decoding="async" title="gray-corner-cabinets-with-doors" class="alignnone wp-image-38732 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-04.gif" alt="white overhead kitchen cabinets and light gray under counter cabinets with white countertop and gray backsplash tiles and hardwood floors and flush mounted light after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>Another key (but hidden!) element of the entire home included installing voice-control lighting. In the kitchen specifically, the homeowner can control the undercabinet and overhead lighting all with the sound of his voice.</p>
<p>“The team did everything very well, but the thing that has impressed me the most has been their commitment to getting everything right, even when minor surprises have come up months after I moved in, and long after I&#8217;d submitted my final payment,” he shared.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: A mini peninsula provides discreet, but accessible storage.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Style finds</b></span>: White quartz countertops: <a href="https://www.wilsonart.com/">Wilsonart</a>. Cabinetry: Custom by Sweeten contractor.

<p>—</p>
<p>A 44-square-foot kitchen with <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/44-square-foot-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of style and storage</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Slide right into a more flexible living space with these renovations</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Walls and doors are losing popularity in the era of open-plan living, but what if you could have the best of both worlds? Imagine a space that is open to the rest of your home—or closed off—depending on your mood. Enter the sliding door: a feature that takes up minimal floor space and blends into its surroundings when not in use, becoming an architectural detail in the home. Whether you prefer the rustic feel of a barn or the simple elegance of French doors, these Sweeten homeowners will inspire you to create a home with disappearing borders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-31.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33691 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-barn-door-white-living-room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-31.gif" alt="white barn door in a white living room with wooden floor after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A classic barn door separates the living room from the bedroom in Zoe and Arvid&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment combination</a>. Painting the door white to match the nearby walls allows it to blend into the background, while black hardware adds contrast with a modern twist.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-34-35.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25786 mb-0 size-chrono" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-36-38.gif" alt="sliding doors, office doors, natural light " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While not in use as an entryway, a pair of sliding doors gives Larry the option to watch a game on the TV in the adjoining lounge from inside his <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-renovation-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">office</a>. The doors also increase the flow of natural light into the windowless room.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-15-16.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25014 mb-0 size-chrono" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-15-16.gif" alt="sliding doors, open floor plan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sliding doors in Ana and Leo&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/general-contractors-dream-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-plan apartment</a> connect the dining area to the office when open, and transform the office into a guest bedroom when closed. In lieu of a traditional door, the oversized panels allow them to combine both rooms into one big space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-09-10.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22102 mb-0 size-chrono" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-09-10.gif" alt="sliding doors, open space, privacy " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Replacing a barn door with three store-bought doors together in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/food-writer-uses-hotel-inspired-style-art-deco-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dining area</a> (and painting it in the same color as the surrounding walls—Hamilton Blue by Benjamin Moore) makes it possible for Lauren and Ross to hide the study when they want to create a more intimate space.<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33872 mb-0 size-chrono" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" alt="sliding doors, french doors, pocket doors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-nyc-homecoming-prompts-a-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flexible living space</a>, Margery and Jim planned to separate the guest bedroom from the kitchen with a pair of sliding doors. Instead of going for a simple set of barn-style doors, the couple&#8217;s general contractor fused together two salvaged French doors the couple found at an estate sale and built them into a pocket door. When opened, the entire wall disappears. Magic!</p>
