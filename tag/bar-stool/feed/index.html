<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Written in partnership with homeowners Danielle and Michelle</span></em></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Remodeling a converted condo in Hoboken, New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We purchased our home in June 2020, a 1,100-square-foot condominium in a former 1800s schoolhouse. The downtown Hoboken, NJ building was converted into condos 30 years ago, and we love its character—our apartment has 24-foot ceilings with original wood beams.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02.jpg" alt="Galley kitchen with bar seating and black cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52149" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are Danielle, an attorney, and Michelle, a human resources manager, and our plan was to move here with our two cats, Sylvia and Eleanor. We knew going into the purchase that we would renovate the kitchen and bath. Both needed a facelift. We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/67197" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project on Sweeten</a>, with accurate specs, and soon got responses from contractors interested in working with us. It wasn’t long before we found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5676#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a contractor we felt was a great fit</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our goals for the renovation were easy to convey, since the existing rooms’ shortcomings were obvious. The kitchen was closed off from the rest of the living area and outdated—we wanted to open it up and connect it to the living area. It was not only badly designed, but in poor condition, too. The cabinets were falling apart; we had to lift one of the doors with a foot to open or close the dishwasher. The bathroom was also in bad shape, with cracked tiles and water damage.</span></p>
<h3>A black kitchen, bold yet neutral</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wanted our remodel to be clean, modern, and simple, but still a statement. In 5 to 10 years, it should still look updated. We chose black cabinets and other features because they would stand out and look timeless. Neutral tones would complement decorative accents, and we like the clean feeling of white surfaces. We also wanted natural elements that would tie to the condo’s existing wood floors and warm up the space. We felt the palette would come together to create a modern, edgy vibe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04.jpg" alt="View of the renovated galley kitchen with open shelving and globe lights" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52151" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03.jpg" alt="Renovated kitchen with beige tile, black cabinets, and white marble counter" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52150" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our objectives in the kitchen included opening the room, increasing storage, and tailoring the cabinets and drawers to our specific needs. Seating would be added to the design to keep the cook company during dinner prep.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In planning the layout, the inclusion of base <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/semihandmade-cabinets-up-the-ante-without-the-pricetag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinets with drawers to maximize storage</a> was important to us. We wanted, too, to add a pantry, which the kitchen did not previously have; we managed to fit it in just right of the fridge. We were excited to find matte black cabinets—they look expensive but were more affordable than traditional cabinets, and almost as customizable. Plus, they’re made from recycled plastic! The wooden floating shelves add not only a natural touch but easy-access storage for dishes and glasses.</span></p>
<h3>Creating a home baker&#8217;s kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The plan also included new appliances and we decided to splurge on a high-end package. Danielle is an avid baker and successfully jumped on the sourdough bandwagon when the pandemic began—she loves being able to preheat the oven from her phone. We were set on a full-size fridge with an ice maker. We also fit in the world’s smallest wine refrigerator, at about six inches wide. We don’t drink much but love to have a few cold bottles on hand—this fridge holds seven.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06.jpg" alt="Black cabinets, stainless steel appliances, white marble counters, natural wood shelving" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52153" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Wallpaper and black paint for a bathroom</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the bathroom, we wanted to go simple and coordinate with the kitchen. We wanted the space to feel connected, and to that end, we kept to a similar neutral color scheme and same tile shapes. We installed a glass shower, knowing that the transparent walls would make this space feel bigger. In any case, we already have a tub upstairs. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went with a statement wallpaper</a>. We thought it made sense to go playful in the small bathroom. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">What we did participate in was shopping for all of our materials, creating our vision and the end result!</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09.jpg" alt="Bathroom with walk-in shower, vanity, and large mirror" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52156" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Managing during the home remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As first-time renovators, we were unsure about the timing of various phases and what the overall costs would be. We talked about when the materials, which we sourced on our own, needed to come. During the renovation, w</span><span class="s1">e retreated to Danielle’s parents’ home in Arizona. The condo is an open loft and isn’t conducive to phone calls—we didn’t think it would be possible to live, work, and renovate from home.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">What we did participate in was shopping for all of our materials, creating our vision and the end result!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was hard not being able to see the project’s daily progress, and to step back from our inclinations to micro-manage. But we did. We communicated our choices and concerns to our Sweeten contractor, from afar, usually over texts or on phone calls. Our contractor was patient and sent pictures as progress updates. Along the way, we learned the importance of communicating—ask questions and tell your contractor what you want, as you are your best advocate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07.jpg" alt="Bathroom with black and white walls and vanity" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52154" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08.jpg" alt="Bathroom with glass shower door and black matte hardware" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52155" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since we had a great relationship with our contractor, and we made all of the budgetary and design decisions, we didn’t end up needing to use some services Sweeten had to offer. Still, we were grateful for the match with a contractor we knew was vetted. We felt peaceful knowing that Sweeten had our back if an issue were to arise.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Tips on staying on budget</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we had one piece of advice to share, it would be about the budget. Figure out what your limit is—the one that you can actually afford. From there, expect a few unexpected costs. Go through your projection line by line with your contractor and be clear about what isn’t included in their quote. If money is a concern, pick a few pieces you’re in love with to splurge on and go for more affordable options for everything else. We paid about $50,000 for both rooms, all-inclusive of work and materials. We went for the pricier appliance package, which cost about $8k.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s such an incredible feeling to transform a space into exactly what you want and what you need. We’ve never experienced that before. We now understand the appeal. Amazing! At home! It was worth every penny.</span></p>

<h3>Wear-and-tear of a well-used kitchen shows</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 23 years since Susan and Carl bought a one-bedroom East Village co-op, they&#8217;ve made a lot of changes. “The history is long in this space,” said Susan, including withstanding 16 years of kids and dogs. She isn’t exaggerating. This couple bought the neighboring studio apartment in 1997, bumping up their square footage to 1,400. They hired someone to do the bare minimum to connect the two apartments and did everything else themselves. A few years later, while an “inept” contractor did a poor job of fixing up the bathroom, the couple went on to do a DIY job with the kitchen. A leaky dishwasher eventually ruined the flooring.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With low interest rates, they decided to refinance their mortgage and renovate, which brings this story to the present day. Despite those DIY fixes, the kitchen wasn’t at its full potential. A dropped ceiling in certain areas eliminated what could be very useful storage space. The recessed canned lights hanging from the ceiling also made the kitchen feel small. Even with a cutout in the wall toward the living room, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/entertaining-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">layout didn&#8217;t suit entertaining</a>. “Whenever we had company,” said Susan, “everyone would squeeze into the end of the kitchen while I cooked and doled out snacks.”</p>
<h3>Finding the right expertise to get the job done</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the disaster of the bathroom contractor etched in their minds, Susan and Carl promised themselves to scrutinize the next person they worked with. They found Sweeten and posted their project, a choice that paid off many times over. For example, they discovered a beam that they feared would force them to shorten the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets and give up storage space</a>. But the Sweeten contractor they chose “knew exactly how to notch out the back of the taller cabinets to accommodate the beam,” said Susan.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29532 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog08.jpg" alt="nyc kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple spent hours on Pinterest and decided against uniformity in the long, narrow space, opting for family- and pet-friendly materials and layout instead. “We wanted to eliminate the bowling alley feel,” she said. This was achieved by mixing cabinets and shelves, as well as glass and solid doors, and horizontal and vertical lines. Moving the window gate from the inside to outside was another simple fix that made a big difference. That change now enables them to open the bottom half of the gate. They opted for a painted backsplash rather than tile. “It leaves open the possibility of changing colors when you get tired of it,” she said.</p>
<h3>Lessons learned from this East Village renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The job went smoothly with no issues with her contractor—even though the &#8220;construction dust was hard to live with&#8221;—the couple still has tips for other renovators: 1. Triple your <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-kitchen-renovation-take-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timeline estimate</a> to get a realistic sense of how long a renovation will take, and 2. When your kitchen is out of order, there’s a lot you can do in a slow cooker and rice cooker, including pasta!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: This East Village renovation was full of pleasant surprises along the way. When their Sweeten contractor ripped out the dropped ceiling, Susan and Carl had expected to find something that would slow the project down. Instead, no wires, pipes or anything structural was found inside. “Compared to any other [renovation] jobs, nothing significant held us back with this one,” said Susan.</p>

<h3>From Renting to Buying</h3>
<p>I’ve always had a passion for real estate. I even work in real estate tech as a product manager. Since moving to the city over 10 years ago, I’ve spent my fair share of time looking at listings of apartments for sale. After many years in tiny Manhattan studios (think 300 square feet), it was time to get serious about buying an apartment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57243 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/27395-Kayla-KitchenBath-11.webp" alt="Portrait of the renovators with their dog" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/27395-Kayla-KitchenBath-11.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/27395-Kayla-KitchenBath-11-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/27395-Kayla-KitchenBath-11-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-57245 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/27395-Kayla-KitchenBath-05.webp" alt="Image of a sunken living room with wooden floors and cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/27395-Kayla-KitchenBath-05.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/27395-Kayla-KitchenBath-05-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/27395-Kayla-KitchenBath-05-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>I started to hunt for Manhattan apartments (with a preference for downtown) that were both affordable and true one-bedrooms. I spent around nine months going to open houses on Sundays, and after seeing many apartments, I finally stumbled upon the space I ended up buying in Chelsea.</p>
<p>It might have been how quiet and calm the apartment felt, but it was exactly what I was looking for. It is a true one-bedroom in a prewar building and has much of its original charm: a sunken living room and beautiful arches. But the original kitchen was the size of a closet. I used the fact that it was outdated as negotiating leverage and was able to bring the purchase price significantly below asking (a rarity in Manhattan).</p>

<blockquote><p>Everyone I talked to told me that the most I’d fit into the space was a 24” stove, but my heart was set on fitting a large turkey into my oven.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Deciding Who to Hire</h3>
<p>After asking around, I realized that finding a general contractor to do work in a Manhattan co-op was no easy task. I stumbled upon Sweeten, and after <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27395" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting my job</a> there, I connected with a few general contractors. I didn’t go the architect route because it would have added to my budget on top of the renovation materials. Also, I wasn&#8217;t <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planning any significant structural change</a>s. For a one-bedroom renovation, that extra cost is just enough to push the cost over the return. Without an architect, however, finding a detail-oriented general contractor who is on top of their game was paramount. That’s exactly what I found with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3275#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Sweeten contractor I chose</a>.</p>

<h3>Must-Have: An Oven to Fit a Turkey</h3>
<p>The biggest part of the remodel was gutting my tiny kitchen. I hired a kitchen designer to help me optimize the layout. She came up with configurations I couldn’t imagine possible in a 70-square-foot space. As an avid cook, I had a few (okay, maybe slightly crazy) requirements: a full size 30” stove, a large refrigerator, and a dishwasher. I was told the most I’d fit into the space was a 24” stove, but my heart was set on fitting a large turkey into my oven. And after much finagling, we found a layout that allowed for everything I wanted and more (somehow, I even fit a wine fridge).</p>

My Sweeten contractor worked closely with me to come up with a solution: a combination of <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/kitchen-cabinets/buying-guide/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom and standard cabinets</a>. We spent two hours talking through cabinet door sizes as well as placement so that the doors were symmetrical and made sense for the space. (Trust me, this guy pays a lot of attention to detail.) For my peninsula, he took the lead on creating both a practical layout and aesthetically pleasing geometric shape. There needed to be enough room to pass when walking into the apartment (the front door is right near the kitchen).</p>

<h3>A Refresh for the Apartment</h3>
<p>Beyond the kitchen, the remainder of the renovation was giving the apartment a facelift. I refinished the floors, stripped the door frames down to their original steel, replaced the baseboards, changed the grout in the bathroom, added a closet in the bedroom, and put a nice layer of paint on all of the walls.</p>
<h3>Delivery Saga</h3>
<p>While much of the kitchen renovation was a fun process, I’d be lying if I said there weren’t bumps along the way. Most of my friends do not believe me when I tell them I bought six sinks for the kitchen. Yep, you read that right: six sinks. To make a long story short: there was a farmhouse sink that was too shallow (thankfully, my contractor pointed this out to me), one that fell off a truck during delivery, another that arrived and didn&#8217;t fit, another that arrived then got lost (and eventually found again), and two others that ended up getting returned. When the sink saga was over, my boyfriend told me he never wanted to talk about another sink again. And honestly, who could blame him?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I ended up with a beautifully renovated home that stayed true to its prewar nature. A common question I was asked after completing my renovation was: Would I do it all over again? You betcha.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Kayla and Jesse, for sharing your refreshed home!</em></p>

<h3>Wrestling with the idea of renovating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We moved to Clinton Hill over a decade ago, and always loved the neighborhood with its history of housing for returning servicemen who worked in the Navy Yard. On a total whim, we went to an open house in the Clinton Hill Co-ops and made an offer on the first apartment we saw: an 800-square-foot, one-bedroom that had been converted into a junior two-bedroom.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was frighteningly familiar with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span class="s2">Clinton Hill Co-op section</span></a> of the Sweeten website. Our neighbor also used <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to renovate her kitchen, and it looked fantastic. It seemed like a simple concept, but Jim and I were just completely overwhelmed with the idea of a renovation. Because our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment</a> really felt like it was falling down around us, we knew that we would need to change almost everything.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to look for a place upstate, hoping that more room and a home for weekend getaways would help alleviate the stress of our overcrowded and dark apartment. We made an offer on a house, had it approved, started to negotiate, and realized we needed to feel good in our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary residence</a> before we took on a second space.</p>

<h3>Finding our general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We headed straight to </span>Sweeten<span style="text-align: justify;">, were <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with three general contractors</a> right away, and within a week </span>picked our contractor<span style="text-align: justify;">. He was incredibly responsive and patient with us as we walked through our apartment over and over again, thinking about the best way to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open our kitchen</a>, update the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>, reconfigure our bedroom, shore up our pockmarked walls and ceiling, refinish our floors, and add storage everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We were absolutely giddy with the concept of overhead lighting! We were wired for several fixtures in the living room and kitchen, as well as recessed lights in the hallways and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. Because our apartment had been dark and crowded for so long, we gravitated toward a simple, minimalist design with white and gray paint to brighten the space and give it a clean look.</span></p>
<h3>Personalizing the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim grew up with visions of a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> island where everyone could gather</a> to eat and socialize–that became our only non-negotiable. It helped us focus our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning on the kitchen first</a>. We knew we wanted custom cabinets, so our contractor brought in his cabinet maker to meet with us and walk through the layout.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Within a week, they had sent us a 3D rendering of our new kitchen, with Jim’s dream island, plus an extended butcher block counter ideal for our boys to sit and finish homework while we cook. Our contractor suggested the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sophisticated-chalkboard-paint-ideas-4582330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chalkboard paint—now a huge hit with the kids</a>. He created a lot of extra storage under the island, including drawers for our pots and pans, plus a pantry along the extended counter. We have a dishwasher for the first time ever and love the kitchen tile.</p>

<h3>Storage reimagined</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor had the genius idea to extend our bedroom two feet into the living room, which allowed him to build a closet (we used to store our clothes in the boys’ room). It was worth the minimal loss of space to gain more storage. We also hired a closet company to build a shoe closet for us. Since our room has two windows, we decided on an <span>opaque</span> glass door to maintain some privacy, but also take advantage of the natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, kids' bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36112 " srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Our contractor came through on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the boys&#8217;<span style="color: #333333;"> bedroom</span>, our only <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directive was storage</a>, storage, storage. We wanted to find a way to keep all of their things in the bedroom, instead of spilling out into our common living areas. Once again, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our contractor came through</a> on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room, ensuring we lost very little floor space. We’re not falling all over stuff anymore!</p>

<p>In the <span style="color: #333333;">bathroom</span>, we needed to keep a bathtub because we have young boys, and I insisted on a large piece of custom glass as our partial shower door. He warned me it might be difficult to reach around for the water control, but I insisted. It looks lovely, but he was right—it’s a bit of a struggle to help with bathtime.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, bathroom, shower, toilet, home, design" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36116 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Moving out during the renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our biggest challenge was realizing that, because we were <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating the entire space</a>, we would have to move out for an extended period of time. We didn’t initially budget to live somewhere else, so the added cost was a bit of a shock. After three months, we were scheduled to move back in and had left the rental, when our contractor told us he was about a week behind. Much of this delay was due to some delayed deliveries of things I had ordered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had no place to go and had to live in the apartment while there were still tools and supplies everywhere, with no appliances or kitchen counters. It was a bit uncomfortable, but not unmanageable. In hindsight, we probably should have just booked the rental for an extra week as insurance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with Sweeten made us wonder what we had waited for. We were matched so quickly with a contractor, we were able to use the website to see examples of his work, we could reach out with questions and concerns. Another upside was the Sweeten blog, a huge source of inspiration! Our new apartment is <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exactly what we had hoped for</a>: simple, comfortable, bright, and uncluttered. It feels like home.</p>
