										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The decorative trim of crown molding adds timeless character and visual appeal</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-29.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43509 size-full" title="baseboard, crown, mantelpiece molding" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09.jpg" alt="Renovated dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Molding and picture frame molding by</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-traditional-house-remodel-offers-a-dose-of-modern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Are you satisfied with the overall look of the rooms of your house? Furniture and decor aside, does it have the character you crave? If not, consider introducing molding. The addition of trim along the ceiling, at the floor, and around doorways (even on walls) will add the depth and distinction you seek. This is true for new and old, modern and traditional houses alike. When introduced with imagination and care, molding also will boost the perceived value of a home.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;list&quot;,{},&quot;list_item&quot;,{&quot;indent&quot;:1,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;numbered&quot;}]"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Crown molding styles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can add trim to just about any area of a room, from ceiling to floor, and areas in between. Some molding styles will work anywhere; others are designed to fit a specific location. Here’s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding &#8211; Just as the name indicates, crown molding crowns the room when placed at the seam or transition between the ceiling and the wall. Styles can be very simple or highly elaborate and combined to create a unique and refined installation. You can also work with a fabricator to design and cut from wood the exact look you want, but this will cost more than pre-made (see materials and profiles below).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Casing &#8211; This trim serves to conceal the gap between the wall and the door or window frame. With regard to doorways, it also helps to stabilize the opening, so this is one trim you don’t want to skip. Casing and baseboard should match or closely resemble each other for a cohesive look that doesn’t dominate a room (particularly one with a crown molding).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42943 size-full mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg" alt="Old house open concept" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><em>(<span style="color: #76808f;">Above)</span></em> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/1920s-house-remodel-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyli and Luke&#8217;s</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">picture frame molding jazzes up plain walls straight up the stairwell</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Chair rail &#8211; Functioning as both decoration and protection, a chair rail resides about halfway up a wall to protect the surface from dings from furniture placed close by. Decorative options abound here. As a natural separator, the areas above and below the chair rail may be painted a different color, or covered with wood paneling or wallpaper. Another practical benefit: if an area needs to be repaired, you don’t have to replace the surface material—paint or wallpaper—on the entire wall for a perfect match. You can just replace the damaged material above or below the molding.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Panel molding &#8211; This decorative molding is used to trim out raised-panel wall construction. Beadboard and wainscoting are a couple of examples.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Picture frame molding &#8211; This molding serves two types of applications. Use it to create a frame (or frame within a frame) on a wall, which can be further defined with paint, fabric, or wallpaper. Or run it along walls near the ceiling to support hooks for picture wires, eliminating nail holes in the wall.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-25575 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry&#8217;s</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">p<span class="s1">anel molding, painted a deep teal blue, gives their dining room personality.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Baseboards &#8211; Besides casing, this trim is the most common. It sits at the juncture between the wall and the floor. The purpose is twofold: to protect against shoe scuffs and to give the floor a finished appearance, hiding any separation that may occur as the room settles. You can go narrow or wide here, as your taste and the room’s style dictate.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Medallions &#8211; Typically used to conceal the opening through which a light fixture such as a chandelier descends, medallions are also decorative. Available in a range of sizes, apply one or several for pure embellishment on a wall, as an alternative to art.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to use decorative crown molding</h3>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding most commonly runs along the perimeter of two surfaces to conceal or soften the appearance of the transition between them. Think window frames or crown moldings, described above.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It can also be applied to pleasing and elegant effect to top cabinets or a bookcase, for a built-in, bespoke look.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding that is at least a couple inches deep can also serve as a wall shelf or plate rail in a kitchen.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Go even deeper and you can employ molding for a fireplace mantel.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Drop crown molding a few inches from the ceiling and light it for an extra touch of drama in a living or great room, or a romantic glow for a dining room. There are two-piece molding systems available with lights in the lower molding that project upward, illuminating the upper piece. Your contractor can help you create a similar effect with a strip of LED lights.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Also consider UL-Listed hollow crown molding that can hide common household wiring, good for a home office.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28325 size-chrono" title="crown molding and window casing" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-1-723x482.jpg" alt="crown molding" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>(<em>Above)</em> <span class="s1"><span style="color: #76808f;">Crown molding at the top of these twin windows and panel molding below in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janet and Jerry&#8217;s</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">brownstone</span>.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding materials and profiles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Molding is widely available through stores like Home Depot and Lowe’s as well as lumberyards and some hardware stores. You’ll find a vast selection of profiles—the shape or contour that you see when the molding is seen from its side—from crisp, straight edges to sensuous, elaborate curves. Stock items come in six- or eight-foot lengths.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Patterns &#8211; what you see from the front—include classic dentil and egg-and-dart, as well as floral and abstract designs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for what molding is made of, the most popular options include wood, of course, as well as MDF, plaster, and plastic. All of these materials can be painted, and the woods can be stained.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Wood &#8211; Wood molding comes in a variety of species, some hard like maple, and some soft like pine. Go for wood if you want to match walls of the same species or seek an effect from a distinctive grain, like that found in fir or oak. Wood takes stains, varnishes, clear coating, or paint. Some manufacturers will offer wood molding pre-primed and ready for painting.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For an authentic, historic look, check out salvage outlets for reclaimed wood molding from old, deconstructed houses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a natural material, wood will respond to changes in humidity so it’s not for rooms with a lot of moisture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28322 size-chrono" title="medallion molding" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="crown molding" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> </span><span class="s1"><span style="color: #76808f;">An elaborate ceiling medallion takes the contemporary edge off this hyper-modern kitchen in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavi and David&#8217;s</a><span style="color: #76808f;"> historic townhouse. Original molding frames the doorway.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">MDF &#8211; Made of wood fibers and resin, medium-density fiberboard (MDF) is a stable yet flexible material, suitable for surfaces that are not completely flat or even. It resists water better than wood and is lighter than plaster but heavier than the plastic options. It should come pre-primed, ready to paint or finish once installed.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Plaster &#8211; A time-honored molding material going back a couple centuries, plaster offers lots of choice in ornate designs. Since it’s also heavy and rigid, it’s not good for rooms where walls are not plumb. For experienced installers only!</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Plastic &#8211; There’s a range of options within plastics—polyurethane, polystyrene, PVC. All are flexible to conform to rooms with curves. They are also lightweight, and hence easier to handle than plaster and some woods. Of particular importance, plastics are waterproof, and so will not expand, constrict, split, or warp from exposure to changes in temperature or moisture, such as a kitchen or bath. They are also easy to cut and come ready to paint or faux finish.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Metal &#8211; This material is for rooms with stamped metal ceiling panels.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to install crown molding</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unless you are an experienced DIYer, it’s best to work with a pro when selecting the size of crown molding for a particular application. First, you or the contractor will need to match the molding to your home’s era and décor. Note that mid-century architecture, in its drive to streamline, did away with most ornamentation. Because of this, it will be hard to find crown molding examples from this time. However, very simple trim—molding, baseboard, and casings—can enhance even a very contemporary or minimal space to make the room feel truly finished. Here, paint the trim the same color as the walls.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pick the right crown molding for your home</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The array of styles and range of materials make molding a simple and fairly thrifty addition to a room—once you’ve made your selection! It can transform a room without requiring you to move a single wall or replace a bit of furniture. <span class="s1">If your home has a historic or traditional heritage, you have much more leeway for choosing different types of molding, including very elaborate styles. Look at pictures of historic homes online or in books for period-appropriate inspiration and guidance.</span></p>

Guest post by Sweeten homeowners Heather and Eric in Manhattan</p>
<p><em>Even though Heather and Eric knew nothing about renovating, they took the chance of starting a remodeling project before moving into their new apartment. Their interpretation of &#8220;home, sweet home&#8221; meant a non-cookie-cutter space with natural light, a welcoming kitchen, architectural details, and wide-plank flooring. With the help of the team they connected with through Sweeten, the free service that matches homeowners with vetted general contractors, the renovating couple&#8217;s &#8220;get-it-done&#8221; attitude included ferrying materials through the city with up-to-the-minute decisions to meet a five-week timeline.  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we were looking for a new place, we ignored all gut-renovation apartments off-the-cuff, but when we saw this 850-square foot co-op, we knew it had great potential. It was dark, barren, and dated, and probably hadn’t been touched since it was built in 1972, but it had natural lighting from the east, south, and northern exposures, high-rise views, and a prime location. Neither Heather nor I had previous renovation experience, but through conversations with friends and family, and research on Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we felt prepared to post our Gramercy apartment remodel project</a> and move forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Heather, not knowing an engagement proposal was forthcoming, eagerly pushed for the exciting summer project. So only three days before I popped the question, we put in an offer on the property. After she said, &#8220;Yes!&#8221; the project truly began.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our goal was to take this dark space that had no overhead lighting, &#8217;70s popcorn ceilings, and a cramped galley kitchen and modernize it, opening it up to highlight the apartment’s natural light and spaciousness. We wanted it to feel unique and stand out from the crowd of standard New York starter homes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We prepared a timeline to begin the day after closing with the goal to finish the job in five weeks in order to beat our old apartment’s lease expiration. However, after the seller delayed the closing, we had to improvise living remotely for three weeks and then through the final two weeks of construction. With this delay, we, along with our contractor, had to personally roll our new kitchen cabinets across two New York City avenues! On top of that, our building only allowed renovation work between 9 am to 4 pm on weekdays. Did I mention we had no prior renovating experience?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With a timeline like this, Sweeten was critical in hiring our contractor—before which, we had interviewed three contractors who could not meet our timeline or budget. Sweeten immediately matched us with two contractors who both had great reviews and offered competitive quotes. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The one we chose was eager</a> to meet our timeline, always arriving early and ending late. He visited us on weekends and did additional research and buying outside of the labor and roughing. Our contractor provided ideas when asked and would respond with a “No problem” to any request—a luxury during a difficult and stressful project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We created a defined foyer by reframing walls and building a Moroccan archway, which led into the kitchen. Other hallway closets were also reframed to provide symmetry throughout the apartment.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32378 size-chrono" title="gray-panelled-glass-door-white-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13.gif" alt="gray panelled glass door over white counter and white bar stools after renovation " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32376 mb-0 size-chrono" title="black-framed-window-gray-wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen09-723x1085.jpg" alt="black framed window in a gray wall and white kitchen counters after renovation " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen09-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen09-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen09.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We envisioned an open kitchen with a bar counter that provided a natural gathering spot for breakfast and entertaining. To get there, we completely gutted the kitchen, replacing all of the old cabinets and appliances, and took advantage of every inch of space. We moved the refrigerator to the opposite side of the kitchen and raised the microwave by six inches, allowing us to cut through the wall of the previous galley kitchen and create an opening with recessed, under-cabinet puck lighting. We accented the space with quartz countertops, glass cabinetry, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/at-home-with-herringbone-patterns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">herringbone</a> marble backsplash, and stainless steel hardware.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32379 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-bedroom-recessed-light" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen11-723x482.jpg" alt="blue bedroom with recessed light in white ceiling and dark wooden flooring after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tackling the lack of overhead lighting, we chose nonstructural beams in the living room and bedroom with LEDs inserted. The beams gave the space a unique structural aesthetic and provided a clever lighting solution. We then added <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crown molding</a> in the entire apartment for more dimension. The flooring throughout had been a traditional parquet not revisited since the original construction of the building in the ‘70s. We replaced it with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wide-plank-flooring-smart-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wide-plank</a> espresso hardwood flooring to balance the white and off-white cabinetry and furnishings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, at post-renovation, we realize how important it is to plan ahead. It’s better to have all your ideas on paper before you begin, from important aspects like flooring and appliances to the small details that are easy to overlook, such as cabinet hardware, paint colors, lighting fixtures, and electrical outlets. Having this mapped out will make your life and your contractor’s life much easier during the renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Truthfully, we look back and are still unsure how we were able to sketch, design, renovate, and implement all of our aesthetic and structural changes without any background or experience in any of these areas. Day by day, the apartment came together and by the end, we were incredibly proud of what we accomplished. Now we have a few months to relax before the wedding.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26634 mb-0 size-chrono" title="homeowner Miguel" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg" alt="custom closets" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After living in the gritty and creative city of Berlin for several years, Miguel, a native New Yorker who works in the music industry, decided to move home. He searched for about nine months for an apartment with character, but in the end, settled for a one-bedroom in a 1950s co-op that he described as bland, cookie cutter, and a white box. At least the location was good—by the water in Cobble Hill. He <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11725" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his profile</a> and turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten contractor</a> banking on transforming the 700-square-foot apartment—this is his third renovation—into a unique home with custom closets. What he didn’t bet on was uncovering beautiful details the apartment had all along.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: Did you renovate your apartment soon after the purchase or were you living in the space for a while?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> I had it for about nine months. I lived on a mattress on the floor because I just moved back from ten years in Berlin, so I was really starting from scratch. Part of living in the apartment beforehand was to figure out what to do with it. You need to live in the space so you can see how it is going to function in different seasons.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: Where is the apartment and when was it built? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> It is by the water in Cobble Hill. The neighborhood is tree-lined and historically protected. The apartment is about 700 square feet and in a 1950s co-op. It looked like a cardboard box. It had absolutely no character, so one of the hardest things was to incorporate character. It was boxy with a kitchen, living room, and bedroom with no flow between the rooms. I opened up another part of the wall between the living room and bedroom, like a doorway, and now light from the bedroom window can spill out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> <strong>Did you know about the ceiling beams and exposed brick wall before you started the renovation?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> They were not planned at all. My contractor was fixing some electrical stuff and we found this beautiful brick wall behind there and then we found the beams. The beams and the brick walls were a game-changer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> <strong>How did you incorporate them into the renovation?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> The brick wall in the living room was not so pretty so I <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painted</a> it all white, but left the bedroom original. In this way, the texture continues from the living room to the bedroom in two different colors. The ceilings were not very high so I wanted to paint the beams. There was a lot of discussion with my Sweeten contractor about that. He didn’t want me to paint the beams, but we did in the end. It comes down to a personal taste thing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: What did you do with the floors? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> The floors were the original thin pine floorboards, but there was almost nothing underneath so they creaked. We put in a layer of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproofing</a> with an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">engineered wood floor</a> on top. The heat gets pretty hot here in NYC and wood expands and contracts which engineered wood handles better than solid wood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: Was there anything else you did to add character?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> We added crown molding. The walls were literally just sheet rock and the window. Adding crown molding made the windows look bigger and gave them texture. Now, it is almost like a picture frame.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> <strong>What did you do about storage?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> I got rid of a wall of storage closets as you walk in. I made up for it by <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building</a> two small, custom closets on either side of the entrance. This also created a small “entryway” which was missing, but I still needed more storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Around the same time, I had also wanted a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">door</a> for the new opening between the bedroom and living room. I thought about a glass door, but that didn’t feel right. I contacted a local millworker in Brooklyn and asked if a wardrobe could be put on rollers. They said the railings that it would roll on needed to be tight against the wall to stop it from toppling. It is kinda amazing. You never know if it is going to work out right, but it worked out perfectly. So now I have a way to close off the room AND a place to store my clothes and shoes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: The kitchen counter has a nice mix of materials. How did that come about? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> Another challenge was trying to find a dining table. I didn’t have room for one, but I had room for a kitchen counter. I decided to make a table out of a slab of walnut with hairpin steel legs as an extension of the counter. When guests come over, I can move it anywhere in the apartment as a standalone table. It also adds a nice segue to the living room. Above the other counter and range, I decided to keep open shelving. It makes the kitchen feel big as opposed to having a wall of cabinets.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How did your Sweeten help you? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> My contractor was really smooth. I loved that he was fair. There are always going to be mistakes on the contractor&#8217;s end and on mine. I changed my mind a bunch of times—sometimes things in my head didn’t translate into reality. He was really patient with me and open to my crazy ideas.<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These homes were stuck in the past until a (long overdue!) home renovation brought each one back to the future</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners who are feeling ambitious and want to take on a home that hasn’t been changed in decades have a unique opportunity. In an older home that’s been given new life, updated features sit alongside quirky and charming details from the past, such as crown molding and arched doorways. This kind of home renovation where the marriage of old meets new provides all the benefits of a modern space while retaining the character that can only come from a place that has a history. Below, three Sweeten homeowners take on the challenge of revamping older homes—and the results are truly magical.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25404 size-chrono" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><br />

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank">Meredith’s townhouse</a>, built in 1941</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meredith set out to find a fixer-upper and fell in love with a two-family brick Tudor townhouse in Kensington that only had one owner since 1941. With good bones and plenty of personality in the form of arched doorways and a 1950s Caloric stove, the home had potential, but it also required intensive repairs. Lead paint, cloth-wrapped aluminum <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-electrical-work-costs/" target="_blank">electrical wiring</a>, and old steel windows all had to go. Meredith found a contractor on Sweeten and started her renovation, focusing on maintaining some of the ‘40s charm while making necessary functional updates. A new kitchen was designed around the old stove, and in keeping with the theme of nostalgia, Meredith installed a salvaged Sub-Zero fridge and vintage enamel sink. The Pepto-Bismol pink bathrooms were redone in a much more tasteful palette of muted blues and received all new fixtures. Upstairs, the renovation included converting the second kitchen into a master bath, building a nursery, and updating the master bedroom and closet. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the rest of this lovely townhouse.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ron lived in his Upper East Side postwar apartment for 40 years before making the decision to renovate. He worked closely with his interior designer, who came to Sweeten to find a contractor to complete their team. The plan consisted of a total gut renovation of the kitchen as well as painting the apartment, stripping and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank">refinishing floors</a>, cleaning up the crown molding in the living room, and adding custom millwork to hide old radiator units. He decided against joining the kitchen and living room and instead chose to keep the kitchen enclosed and add finishes that would make it feel larger and brighter. With all new appliances from Thermador, including a refrigerator<strong>, </strong>gas range, hood, and dishwasher, the kitchen got the functional upgrade it desperately needed. Architectural details in the kitchen mixed well with traditional <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank">custom cabinets</a> and beveled countertops for a refreshed yet classic style. In the living room, custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank">built-ins</a> with ample shelving were built to show off Ron’s collection of art and treasures from around the world. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the rest of Ron’s home, including his updated bedroom and bath.</p>

</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years after moving into her Upper East Side apartment, Claudia felt ready to renovate. It had been three decades since the apartment’s last home renovation, which had brought with it dated finishes, carpeting, and boxy built-ins. Claudia wanted to highlight the original bones of the home that had been covered up, reclaim some of the square footage lost to the old built-ins, and install some much-needed electrical outlets. She also ripped up the 30-year-old carpeting, uncovering original parquet floors. The windows in the living room were combined, allowing the space to become flooded with natural light, and the built-in surrounding the fireplace was demolished, revealing a wood-burning hearth. Crown molding was designed and placed along doorways, windows, ceilings, and floors to evoke some of the lost 1920s charm. To brighten up her home, the walls of the apartment were <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank">painted</a> white, replacing the dark green shade that had ruled the living room for decades. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see her updated kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">This Upper East Side apartment is now the perfect showcase for travel treasures and curated art collection</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18492" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/samantha-apartment.jpg" alt="apartment renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/samantha-apartment.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/samantha-apartment-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s dispatch comes from the interior designer of a New York City apartment re-do. Samantha was brought on to help modernize a client’s apartment, and while she was up for leading the ambitious design needs, she needed help finding a general contractor who could execute beautifully on the plans. Her client had filled his home with art and travel finds over the course of four decades in the space, and what started as a “refresh” project evolved into a total apartment renovation to create a light and bright canvas for treasured pieces and cherished friends. </span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Samantha Stein, Interior Designer</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stars aligned when a good friend put me in touch with a potential client I’d known for years. Ron, the homeowner, had been living in the same Upper East Side post-war apartment for 40 years (!) and was ready for some interior changes to freshen it up. We met to discuss priorities and a design vision, and then turned to Sweeten for help choosing a contractor for </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were able to use Sweeten’s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">network to narrow our contractor choice down to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1458#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one firm</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which was experienced and great to work with. They had a reasonable price for our initial wish list, and after we began working with them, we grew more comfortable expanding into more custom solutions and additional scope, for what would ultimately become a full gut renovation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, the theme of the renovation was a relatively minimal ‘refresh’ &#8211; new paint, strip and refinish floors, clean-up details such as the custom five inches of crown molding in the living room, add custom millwork covers for the old and dilapidated radiator units, and complete a full renovation of the very outdated kitchen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18494 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18493" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron, the client, wavered back and forth about updating his traditional apartment into a more modern space with an open-concept living and kitchen area. Ultimately, however, his classical taste and the way he uses the apartment in his daily life led us to leaving an enclosed kitchen, but updating its finishes and changing a few details to make the whole living area feel larger and flow more seamlessly. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We removed both doors to the kitchen in favor of open entryways, demolished the two china cabinets that were edging into the dining space, and intended to continue the existing parquet into the kitchen. But, the more we discussed matching the existing parquet in rooms that had either outdated carpeting or badly damaged linoleum, the trickier it seemed it would be to get the clean, flowing feeling that Ron was looking for. After weighing costs and options with George&#8217;s team, we decided that going with a wide-plank engineered wood throughout the entire apartment (with the direction of the planks leading your eye out to the living room windows) was the right solution for a cohesive, flowing apartment. Ripping out the parquet allowed us to fully level and soundproof the subfloor, as well as fully waterproof the kitchen area. Great sighs of relief went up all around when the 40+ year old parquet and carpeting pieces were hauled out, and the textured wood floors (supplied by Glen Floors) look fantastic. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18496 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-02.jpg" alt="living room remodel" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-02-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18495" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-01.jpg" alt="open living room layout" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-01-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron has a fabulous lifelong collection of china, music, and incredible books on art, music, and travel that were hiding around the apartment. So, one of the top priorities for the renovation was storage. Curating a selected display of these items felt to me the best way to celebrate his travels and life experiences – they should be an integral part of the apartment without looking kitschy or messy. I had originally proposed a huge built-in wall of custom shelving and cabinetry, but pricey bids from other contractors made us step back. Once we started with George&#8217;s team, however, we felt confident we could bring back this concept to make up for the lost kitchen/dining storage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We drew inspiration from several interiors that featured shelving surrounding a ‘nook’ for the sofa, and Michael and Dennis were able to help us flawlessly execute this vision with a stunning custom piece. The weight of the real wood doors, soft-close hinges, adjustable shelving, and hardware we selected from Nassau Suffolk Hardware make it all fit in perfectly—it’s hard to believe it wasn’t there before. We added two brass sconces from Ralph Lauren Home to softly light the sofa area at night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18497 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03.jpg" alt="dark wood floors" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> </span><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18498" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04.jpg" alt="traditional dining table" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen was where the majority of the hard work happened. Our expert team was able to match my every demand. We re-centered the sink on the windows, removed a dropped ceiling section just above the windows, and gained upper cabinets by replacing the double wall ovens with a more conventional range. We saved a ton on appliances with some lucky timing with a big sale at Thermador, and chose a refrigerator, gas range, recirculating hood, and dishwasher from their Professional Series line. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The custom cabinets, again made from real wood, fit perfectly and are of incredible quality. We ordered the Kohler sink from Wayfair and the Rohl faucet from Nassau Suffolk Hardware. Our experts helped us choose Caesarstone quartz countertops instead of a pricier granite or marble, and we are impressed with their quality. Under-cabinet lighting and a few LEDs above the sink, in addition to the overhead fixture, make for lots of different ways to light the kitchen at night. The kitchen alone makes the entire apartment feel new and fresh, and its traditional accents (crown molding and the custom bevel on the countertops) keep it in the same design family as the rest of the apartment. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bedroom and living room, we carefully selected vintage rugs to soften the newly wood-clad floors. Custom millwork radiator covers with picture-frame molding and Caesarstone tops replaced falling-apart metal enclosures for the A/C and heaters under the windows. Each has a powder-coated metal grill inset into the top and they act as gorgeous shelves to display a few more curios. These new units alone make the apartment look so much better! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michael and Dennis also helped us outfit each of the seven closets in the apartment with custom shelving, so that we could reorganize all of Ron’s belongings to make more sense for his daily use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-18504 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11.jpg" alt="custom radiator millwork covers" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18505" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12.jpg" alt="traditional bedroom aesthetic" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were so happy with their work that toward the end of the project, we even decided to hit on a long term wish list item for Ron: a deep-soaking tub in the master bath, and brand new shower and sink hardware (all from Rohl through Gracious Homes) in both bathrooms!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18507 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="rohl shower faucets" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18508" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15.jpg" alt="large format white shower tiles" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the full renovation took a lot of hard work, energy, and time. Ron loves showing off his new space and everyone is thrilled with the results. We’re grateful to the team at Sweeten for matching us with George and his crew, who were dependable and creative.
