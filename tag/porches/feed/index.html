<p class="p2"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50364" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01.jpg" alt="Queens rowhouse" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Outdoor space with potential</h3>
<p class="p1">As the initial “space” to welcome your guests, the front porch sets the first impression. Much like a foyer, it’s an extension of your interior home before entering the main living area. Turning a porch into a place to relax and socialize would expand the living square footage. As a result, upgrading a front porch will add to your home’s value as well as its curb appeal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Read on for Sweeten’s pros and cons on porch types, what goes into a porch remodel, and the starting costs.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5">Remodeling a front porch: 6 types to choose from</h3>
<p class="p2">Any front porch must address your needs. In addition, the front porch should be a seamless addition to the house. Keep your front porch stylistically in line with the rest of the home. This assists with permit applications. Also, it helps the front porch blend in better with the home.</p>
<h4>Covered open front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">A covered open front porch is the most popular, classic type of porch. Many homeowners first think about open porches when they imagine a porch design. This porch has a roof or overhang that is attached to the house. Though this porch has no walls, it often has a railing that helps to define the space and to keep users safe.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Traditional</li>
<li class="li2">Unobtrusive</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Does not protect you from insects</li>
<li class="li2">Partially open to the elements</li>
</ul>
<h4>Screened front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">A screened front porch is a covered front porch that has a metal or fiberglass insect screen in its open areas. A screen door fills in the open door area. Screened front porches are highly desired in areas that have mosquitoes and other insects. Building a screened front porch is essential to enjoying your porch from spring to fall.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Protection against insects</li>
<li class="li2">Inexpensive</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Screen may tear</li>
<li class="li2">Some rain may still enter the porch</li>
</ul>
<h4>Enclosed front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">With an enclosed front porch, the walls are semi-solid, much like a sunroom. Often, the lower part of the sunroom walls is solid. The porch’s upper section is devoted to window glass or to insect screens.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Extends usage through the seasons</li>
<li class="li2">Electrical wiring is possible for outlets</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Less of an open, airy feeling</li>
<li class="li2">Can be difficult to keep cool</li>
</ul>
<h4>Full wrap-around front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">A full wrap-around front porch is any porch that partially wraps across the side of the house. This porch may wrap around two sides (front and side of the house) to form an L-shape. Or the porch may wrap across three sides to form a U-shape.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Integrates well with the overall house design</li>
<li class="li2">More floor space</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">More expensive</li>
<li class="li2">Blocks some house windows’ access to direct light</li>
</ul>
<h4>Entertainment front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">An entertainment front porch is a variation of any porch. This variation includes accessories such as an outdoor kitchen, bar, hot tub, gas fireplace, or TV. Some of the entertainment features can be placed on open-air additions to the porch.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">More space for socializing</li>
<li class="li2">More activities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">May be difficult to recoup investment upon sale</li>
<li class="li2">Accessories require greater maintenance</li>
</ul>
<h4>Open-air front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">An open-air front porch is an uncovered off-shoot to any type of covered porch. This adjacent, connected porch allows for other activities. These might be activities that work better in the open air than in enclosed spaces. These activities might include an open-pit fireplace, recreational space for exercising, or a larger hot tub.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Adds flexibility to the porch</li>
<li class="li2">Creates <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the feeling of a deck</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Increases porch’s cost</li>
<li class="li2">Greater weathering due to lack of cover</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p5">Basic timeline</h3>
<h4>Set your budget, scope, and renovation team</h4>
<ul>
<li>Choose the type of front porch remodel you&#8217;ll do by asking yourself a few questions. Firstly, what activity do you imagine yourself doing on your front porch? Do you think you will be on the porch mostly in the spring, and only infrequently? Then, you may want a covered open front porch. Can you imagine yourself on the front porch all through the summer? In that case, choose a screened or enclosed front porch.</li>
<li>Begin looking for a contractor&#8217;s portfolio of work. Read client testimonials and online reviews. Sweeten can help <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">match you with the right general contractor</a> in scope, location, and budget.</li>
<li>Know your budget. How much do you want to spend? As expected, homeowners like to control the cost of the porch remodel. One way to do this is to only spend available funds. But if you expect that the porch will increase curb appeal enough to boost resale value, then costs will be on the higher end.</li>
<li>Begin <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/prep-bid-remodel-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meeting with contractors</a>. Ask about contractors’ schedules and about expected start times. Most importantly, make sure that the contractor is one who shares your vision and is one you can work with.</li>
<li>Sign a contract with a contractor.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The renovation process</h4>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the contractor’s schedule, work may begin immediately. A company will deliver a roll-off dumpster to your property. Workers will begin demolishing some or all of your porch. For small amounts of debris, a hauling company may come instead.</li>
<li>The crew first dig the holes. Then, concrete is poured for the footers. Posts are attached to the concrete footers. These posts, plus a ledger board on the house, support the porch.</li>
<li>After the concrete has cured, workers install beams and posts.</li>
<li>Flooring is installed. Your front porch flooring might be an exotic wood or a composite wood. Unless this is a fully enclosed front porch, it is usually best to install durable, weather-resistant flooring.</li>
<li>The railing and screen are installed if it is a screened front porch. If it is an open porch, usually only a railing is installed. For more elaborate front porches, semi-solid walls may be added.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p5">Permits and restrictions</h3>
<p class="p2">Most communities require you to obtain a building permit for any substantial modification to your porch. Your contractor can give you advice on whether your front porch remodeling idea will require a permit.</p>
<p class="p2">In cities that have historic preservation and historic landmark overlays, you may need to apply for an additional preservation permit. These permit applications usually require a full set of plans, elevations, and photos.</p>
<p class="p2">If your house is in a housing association neighborhood, the HOA board must approve your project. HOAs tend to carefully look at how the proposed front porch remodel fits in with other houses’ front porches. Also, rules regarding home alterations should be specified in your HOA documentation. You should have received these documents when you bought the house.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Cost to remodel a front porch</h3>
<p class="p2">Any front porch remodeling idea that remains basic and uses few materials can start at $10,000—$15,000. This type of front porch is usually not enclosed. For remodels of this type, the railing might be replaced and the porch is painted. Depending on the size of the space, new materials, and the amenities being added, costs can go as high as $50,000 and more.</p>
<p>As an extension of the interior of the house, the porch is more than a path to the front door. <span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your front porch or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Renovating your front porch? Here&#8217;s what you need to know about renovating (or building!) one, including style, materials, and size</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46915 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Porch-WashingtonDC-72DPI-CROP.jpg" alt="Front porch" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Porch-WashingtonDC-72DPI-CROP.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Porch-WashingtonDC-72DPI-CROP-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Porch-WashingtonDC-72DPI-CROP-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A well-designed front porch is an important part of the home&#8217;s design. Plus, it serves a function; like a place to relax or a space for greeting visitors. Sadly, many porches don’t suit homeowners&#8217; needs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is especially true of porches on older homes that have been remodeled in the past. Previous homeowners often selected design details that clashed with the character of the house. Some removed the front porch entirely, damaging the integrity of the home&#8217;s design.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take note: Porches for historic houses need to be approved by the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) for Washington DC. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s a good idea to list what you don&#8217;t like about the current porch. From this starting point for the front porch renovation, Sweeten outlines the path to building a structure that works with your lifestyle and the house&#8217;s architectural style.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How will you use the front porch?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Porches are transition spaces between the outside world and home. At the same time, they are an extension of living space that is not quite inside or outside. Start your project by determining how you will use the porch space. Will it be a space to greet guests? Will it be a family gathering spot? Do you plan to eat on the porch?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your answers will help determine the features of the new porch. In the Washington DC area, a ceiling fan will make summer evenings more pleasant. The way the porch will be used also determines its size.  Importantly, not all porches extend across the entire front of the building. <strong>Want to estimate the space needed for renovating your front porch? </strong></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A covered entry for greeting guests or judging the weather before venturing outdoors can be about four feet deep.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Porches for relaxing and living on require more space.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Comfortable seating requires a porch that is at least five feet from the wall of the house to the railing. </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Add a dining table and you will need a wider, or deeper, porch. There should be at least 36 inches from a dining chair to an obstruction, like the house&#8217;s wall. </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">To be comfortable when using the table, plan on a 10-foot-deep porch.</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Fitting the front porch with the house</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes renovating a front porch is done to enhance curb appeal.  A well-designed porch can certainly do that, whether it is a renovation or building a whole new structure. However, it&#8217;s important that the porch complement and contribute to the design of the house. It should not look tacked on.  This is especially important where the original porch was renovated in the past or removed altogether. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Renovating or adding a porch to a period home requires a little research. You can take cues from similar houses in your neighborhood.  And there are historical references, including some online, that list period details. Local designers and contractors can also help get the details right. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Porch designs can relate to the house in a few ways, including using similar materials, roof style and architectural details. Matching roof styles, such as gable or hip roofs, will help the porch integrate with the house. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Match exterior materials</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wood frame houses usually have wood porches. Brick houses have brick or other masonry foundations. The roofing material on the porch should match the material on the house. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Architectural details</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Architectural details can be anything from moldings, decorative brackets and medallions, railings and banisters, and columns. The goal is to incorporate the house&#8217;s style characteristics into the porch design. For example, the trim style around the windows might be used for the fascia of the porch.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Using the correct style of front porch columns</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Columns not only support the roof, but they play an important role in porch design. The trick is to use columns that match the style of the house. A colonial home requires classical columns that are in proportion to the porch and house. A craftsman, or bungalow, house can have stone columns or columns that are clad with siding that matches the house. Also, columns should frame doors and windows. They should not be added where they block a window, for example. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Front porch railing design</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The right railing can make or break a porch design. Victorian homes usually have elaborate &#8220;gingerbread&#8221; type railings. Simple railings with clean lines work well with contemporary home designs.  Your own research and advice from experts can help you settle on the right railing system. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding a new front porch</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Placing a porch where one does not exist should follow the same design rules as renovating a front porch. But the process includes building everything from the foundation to the roof. You will be selecting materials for the flooring, ceiling, and railing that work with the original house. In addition, the porch space has to be in proportion to the original house. And that is important because a house and porch not in proportion will never look right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New porches planned for historic homes in Washington DC have special provisions. Basically, a new porch, as well as a renovated porch, must be historically accurate. Approval for changes come from the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) for Washington DC. It is best to check what is and is not allowed before spending too much time on the design process. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Expanding on the back porch</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Back porches are another matter. There is a 20- or 25-foot setback from the rear property line, depending on location in Washington D.Cthe city. But you cannot build out beyond 10 feet from an adjoining house.  So if your back walls lines up with your neighbor&#8217;s, you can <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build a 10-foot-deep back porch</a>. But if their wall or porch is five feet beyond your wall, you can build out 15 feet. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Building permits for porches</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DCRA is the body that issues building permits. The process from application to approval can take two to four months. DCRA circulates the permit application to a number of government agencies, including the Historic Preservation Division. Navigating the process is difficult. But an experienced designer or general contractor will handle the permit process for you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DCRA will consider property setbacks in the process. In the front, you cannot build beyond an existing structure that is closest to the street. So if houses on your block have porches, you can build out to the porch nearest the street. </span></p>
<h4>Starting a front porch renovation</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Considering your own front porch renovation? Porches provide valuable living space, plus they can <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/curb-appeal-goes-a-long-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enhance the curb appeal</a> of a house. But remember—the design, whether a renovation or new construction,  should look like an extension of the main house.  </span></p>
