										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, I got to live vicariously through a delightful homeowner&#8217;s Upper West Side kitchen transformation. Hafeeza and her husband made the big move from a 4,500 square foot home in suburban New Jersey to Manhattan&#8217;s Upper West Side in 2013. After raising five children, Hafeeza and her husband were ready for a retirement relocation that would put the City at their feet and free them from maintaining a large home. They spent a year in a temporary spot before finding the long-term city apartment where they planned to enjoy the essentials: family and friend get-togethers and nightly meals prepared by Hafeeza&#8217;s husband, the devoted family chef. The new space was ideal for those plans, except for the kitchen, which was functional but outdated and lacked the storage and prep space they envisioned. After talking to a number of contractors who weren&#8217;t available for or interested in the scope of the job, Hafeeza took to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to find a contractor for her list of simple and smart upgrades.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/kitchens/upper-west-side-kitchen-and-bathroom-renovation"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11635 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath-00.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath-00.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath-00-585x390.png 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath-00-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Our Sweeten Expert was a true professional from the initial meeting until the final payment.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Hafeeza M., Upper West Side homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Usually, when I talk to homeowners about their renovations, I get a dose of renovation envy: I want THAT sparkling new kitchen, too! But after talking with Hafeeza, I ended up with something extra and unexpected: a renewed appreciation for New York City living and the William Morris mantra we recently explored on the Sweeten blog. One look at <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1962" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hafeeza&#8217;s Sweeten project post</a> and you can see why. Hafeeza started with a call for<span id="more-11633"></span> a no-frills kitchen upgrade to minimize clutter and simplify the space. Her ideas for big and small upgrades were straightforward and to-the-point, with a few unusual details to tailor the kitchen to her lifestyle and her new city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen is enclosed and compact, so Hafeeza planned to add new cabinets, countertops, and appliances, and initially explored removing part of the wall to create a more open feel. The couple also wanted to relocate a closet, coat the entire apartment in fresh paint, and rig the kitchen for a fridge with an ice machine. If I had to name the worldly desires of most New Yorkers, more kitchen space, new paint, and an ice machine might well top the list. However, one request stopped me in my tracks. Hafeeza and her husband wanted to remove the dishwasher. Exclamation points!!! Hafeeza laughed when I helpfully explained to her that a dishwasher is kind of an integral part of a kitchen renovation, if not the holy grail for many new homeowners. She and her husband were certain that they valued more drawer space over the gadget and were happy to pitch in on the dishwashing together. Well. That is a new and interesting dishwashing philosophy!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11673 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_02.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_02.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_02-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11677 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_06.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="901" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_06.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_06-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We matched Hafeeza with Sweeten Expert Pedro who delivered big time with a flawless and angst-free kitchen renovation, first creating clean lines and a unified feel for the cabinets with a plywood base for the upper set, finished in acrylic laminate. The lower set of cabinets and drawers feature acrylic laminate over engineered wood. The glossy finish makes these cabinets easy to keep clean and will guard against dings and wear over time. To create more counter space without changing the room&#8217;s dimensions, Hafeeza relocated the sink from the middle of the counter to the home of the former dishwasher, leveraging plumbing already in place, opening up a more continuous counter prep area, and installing an extra-deep sink basin. Hafeeza chose a stainless steel Blomberg fridge and her husband selected a compact <a href="https://us.bertazzoni.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bertazzoni range</a>. They finished the look with Silestone quartz counters, a neutral and luminous glass tile backsplash, and porcelain floor tiles with a faux wood finish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11674 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_03.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_03.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_03-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11678" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_07.png" alt="SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_07" width="600" height="915" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_07.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_07-197x300.png 197w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, Hafeeza and her husband decided to leave the existing kitchen wall in place. Trying to open it would have added only 18 inches to the galley kitchen. Altering the plumbing to get a fridge with an ice machine also turned out to be overly expensive and unnecessary, so they skipped that detail as well. As they adjusted their plans to get the most out of the work, Hafeeza&#8217;s husband mentioned to Pedro that they had some minor upgrades in mind down the road for the bathroom. With a few quick calculations on the back of a napkin, Pedro and the couple realized they could make room in the budget for re-tiling and new fixtures. Hafeeza found the bulk of the new fixtures at <a href="https://www.decorplanet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decor Planet</a> in Manhattan and outfitted the bathroom with an energy efficient dual-flush toilet from <a href="https://www.frescabath.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fresca</a>, a full-wall medicine cabinet with mirrors inside and out, and a new vanity with storage drawers topped by a vessel sink. With extra storage, new lighting, and an upgraded shower head, Hafeeza and her husband were thrilled to find that they could re-vamp the bathroom within their budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11675 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_04.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_04.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_04-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11679 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_08.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="919" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_08.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_08-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After less than a month of work, Hafeeza and her husband moved into their new home to enjoy more than they had bargained for: the new kitchen, fresh paint throughout the apartment, gleaming bathroom finishes, and a space that let them stay focused on family, friends, and their vibrant new neighborhood. I tried (like three times!) to get Hafeeza to pick her favorite part of the new space but she wouldn&#8217;t budge. &#8220;The whole apartment! We&#8217;re just thrilled! We have New York City at our doorstep. What more do you need?!&#8221; Truly, I have been repeating that mantra to myself for the last week. Thank you, Hafeeza, for sharing your space and your unflappable urban dweller attitude with me!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna moved into their two-bedroom home &#8212; a former kindergarten classroom in a converted South Slope / Greenwood Heights Catholic school &#8212; four years ago. High ceilings, check. Big windows, check. Modern urban oasis, check. Erica, who works for the City of New York, and Donna, a digital product consultant, were initially drawn to industrial and rustic decor as a way to balance and warm up the contemporary feel of their new space. But, after overspending on a pricey couch and accenting the windows and doors with a red paint that grew to irritate them both, the couple decided they needed design help. After they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a>, we introduced them to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/814" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten designer</a> to help bring new life to this old-school space.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="small-bedroom-with-hardwood-before-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47989 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3.jpg" alt="small bedroom with hardwood floor before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="bedroom-with-teal-accent-wall" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47984 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2.jpg" alt="small bedroom with teal accent wall and wall lights and hardwood floors and windows after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Our designer had a lot of creative ideas. Some of the areas of our apartment that she transformed were not even on our radar design-wise until she pointed them out.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Erica W., Brooklyn Homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna focused first on their bedroom. They wanted tranquility, comfort, and a little romance; they also needed to maximize the long, narrow layout of the room and find art to make the space feel personal and vibrant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The designer sought to create a relaxed retreat, in tune with the couple&#8217;s design preferences. She put together an inspiration booklet to illustrate creative concepts, drawings, and to simply nail the creative vision. The trio took group shopping trips and worked together to upgrade the shabby-schoolhouse-chic vibe with cleaner lines, bolder colors, and improved. Their designer led the way with an accent wall in Benjamin Moore Venezuelan Sea, offset by the existing gray on the remaining walls. Two smart tricks here: first, the accent wall appears to wash onto the overdyed rug, lengthening <wbr />the space in a way that makes the furniture selections look custom and built-in, and second, the accent wall provides an immediate visual shift, just by painting a single wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="bedroom-with-teal-accent-wall" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47983 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1.jpg" alt="bedroom with teal accent wall and adjustable long reach wall mounted lights after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna love the gray tufted Cisco Brothers bed &#8211; it anchors the room and offers geometric depth to the monochromatic bedding (full disclosure: I am <a href="https://sweeten.com/team/apartment-renovation-east-village/">partial to gray tufted upholstery</a>!). The designer found a gorgeous and super-functional armed lighting fixture on <a href="https://classifieds.apartmenttherapy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apartment Therapy Classifieds</a> to feature above the bed &#8211; a hat tip to Erica and Donna&#8217;s fondness for industrial pieces but with a decidedly glam finish. Mounting the lighting fixture on the wall above the bed freed up space on each bedside table, crucial in a room with just eight feet in width to spare. If you look closely, you can catch a side glimpse of Marilyn Monroe swimming in the photo on the left wall. Erica especially loves this piece and the shot of red and green it offers up to complement other accents in the room.</p>
<h2>&#8220;I sought to create a refreshingly relaxed retreat. The solution was to carry varying hues of blue and green heavily-pigmented accent walls &#8211; the colors of the sea &#8211; throughout the space. Serene, but invigorating.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>&#8211; </em>Sweeten Designer</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the open living room, their designer set out to rehab the &#8220;expensive mistakes&#8221; that frustrated Erica and Donna. They focused on highly saturated paint colors and new, more comfortable furniture. The windows are such a central feature to the space; the designer restored their presence with Benjamin Moore Super White throughout the room and cleared away stuff that had accumulated on the unusually deep window sills. They also selected a central wall to saturate with yellow, anchoring the space. To further play up the industrial loft theme, a structural beam and elements of the sprinkler system were coated in a dark bronze.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="deep-windows-in-living-room" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47988 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-2.jpg" alt="open living and dining room with hardwood floors and deep windows before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="dining-with-black-framed-windows" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47985 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-3.jpg" alt="open dining area with hardwood floors and windows with black frames after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna swapped out their dining set for Eames molded chairs. The dining table, already part of their collection, reflects the couple&#8217;s love for reclaimed materials, but looks updated with the clean lines of the new chairs. The Milo Baughman coffee table is simple and uncluttered; the Saarinen side table plays up the clean and modern furniture touches &#8211; both were savvy finds on eBay.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Toward the kitchen, visitors get their first glimpse of an accent wall coated in Benjamin Moore Juniper. As a standalone feature, it&#8217;s a fun addition to the yellow and white throughout the room. But, it also serves as a sneak peak into the new bedroom and ties the spaces together visually. Erica and Donna revived the old kitchen cabinets, originally finished with a faux cherry wood stain, by painting them with Farrow &amp; Ball&#8217;s Light Blue. I love this color &#8211; it is equal parts vintage and modern, simple but playful.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Behind the kitchen, Erica and Donna invested in creating a new closet space to help them keep stuff organized and out of sight. Working from the design, this Sweeten contractor built shelving and enclosed the closet with sliding doors and simple hardware.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;ve been following this high-style, high-design project in Chelsea for the last year. The owner of this 900 square foot apartment in the iconic London Terrace building is a friend of Sweeten&#8217;s founder and CEO, Jean. We watched as the homeowner and contractor worked together to bring new life to a space with gorgeous historical roots and we were so psyched about the work happening here, we did what any friend would do: take the referral of a great contractor! These photos would probably be convincing enough, but as we do with every expert in our network, we checked references and interviewed the contractor to get a feel for his talents, expertise, experience, and professionalism. After finishing the project and going through the Sweeten screening process, we&#8217;re delighted to introduce <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/226">Sweeten Expert Gregorio</a> as a new member of our network of professionals. I&#8217;ll have more to share with you this spring about how our screening process works, but first, you have to see these swoon-worthy photos!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11303 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-021.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="397" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-021.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-021-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11304 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-031.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="397" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-031.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-031-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11305 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-041.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-041.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-041-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jean&#8217;s friend, an architect, had lived in the building for almost a decade before this unit hit the market. Prior to moving in, the new homeowner set out to address two main issues: the apartment had a series of cramped rooms dotted with small closets, and the entryway was unnecessarily divided in two segments. Both of these elements were disruptive to the flow, feel, and function of the space<span id="more-11282"></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The results of addressing these two goals alone were dramatic: by combining and moving a closet from the entry hall into the bedroom for a larger walk-in, and annexing another storage area into the bathroom for a true linen closet, the owner opened up the flow of the rooms and created far more functional storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11318 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-01.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-01-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Storage aside, the owner took a meticulous approach to recreating the visual presence of the building&#8217;s heritage. Sweeten Expert Gregorio added accentuated molding details throughout each room to exaggerate the space and add a grander feel. The homeowner was able to keep the original wood floors but transformed them with a matte black finish. The resulting contrast with the white and gray color palette makes the space feel bright but also infuses each room with some grit. It looks natural and effortless now, but it took the homeowner more than six tries, and eight coats, to get the stain effect he had in mind!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11306 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-051.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-051.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-051-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11307 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-061.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-061.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-061-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11308 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-071.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-071.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-071-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gregorio&#8217;s team removed the kitchen island, expanded the flooring into the kitchen to unify the living space, installed white lacquer cabinets, white calacatta countertops, and put in a 24&#8243; Bertazzoni range.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11312 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-111.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-111.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-111-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The homeowner designed the custom built-in millwork in the living room with a high-gloss lacquer section combined with a walnut storage unit to create a light, bright feel complemented by the warmth of the natural wood. The millwork hovers cleanly over the floor, doubling as a showcase for favorite items and as a hideaway for the tv. To continue the play on materials, the radiators were stripped to expose original metals. The new radiators are an unlikely star of the show: visitors to the apartment typically comment first on the apartment&#8217;s views and then on the metallic radiators. A circular lighting fixture from Ochre anchors the living room between original ceiling beams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11309 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-081.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="955" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-081.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-081-188x300.jpg 188w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-081-565x900.jpg 565w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11310 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-091.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="955" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-091.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-091-188x300.jpg 188w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-091-565x900.jpg 565w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11311 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-101.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="955" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-101.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-101-188x300.jpg 188w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-101-565x900.jpg 565w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gregorio worked through a full upgrade of the windowed bathroom, removing the tub to replace it with a walk-in glass shower, ripping out old tile and bringing in black travertine slabs, and swapping out old fixtures with modern sink and toilet selections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedroom, the homeowner designed a second custom built-in that beautifully offsets the neutral palette. Throughout the apartment, in a nod to his architecture and fashion background, the homeowner chose Benjamin Moore&#8217;s Coventry Gray (HC 169), a color favored in Dior stores around the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11313 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-121.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-121.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-121-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So many thanks to Jean&#8217;s friend and Sweeten Expert Gregorio for a peek into this brilliantly designed and expertly built home.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What do you do when you realize that your bathroom is just not working for you anymore? Ben &amp; Therese&#8217;s Brooklyn Heights bathroom wasn&#8217;t even 10 years old before they recognized that the space was ugly, outdated, and felt cramped &#8212; even little Enzo (pictured above) didn&#8217;t want to bathe in what he regarded as a cheap, generic tub &#8212; it was time for an update.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple took a savvy approach, collecting enough inspiration and research online that, together, they were ultimately able to design the bathroom of their dreams and a space that would reflect their personal tastes. They even built a 3D model of their ideas using Google SketchUp to help them plan and visualize the space; according to Ben, &#8220;we didn’t want to leave anything to chance, and we wanted to make sure we utilized every square inch as best we could.&#8221; With their very real vision, Ben &amp; Therese were more than ready to renovate, so <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project on Sweeten</a> to be matched with a vetted general contractor who would help them finish the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10793" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_02.png" alt="brooklyn-heights-bathroom-renovation" width="475" height="462" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_02.png 594w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_02-300x292.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ben &amp; Therese moved forward with their first match who was just the right fit for the project, and in just 4 weeks, Sweeten Expert Aleks and his team were able transform the generic bath into the homeowners&#8217; inspired vision. Here&#8217;s their space before &amp; after:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10794 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03.png" alt="brooklyn-heights-bathroom-renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10795 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_04.png" alt="brooklyn-heights-bathroom-renovation" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_04.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_04-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple took a universal ideal of clean, simple and modern, but made a space that is uniquely theirs by incorporating industrial elements like cement tile &amp; shower doors on sliding hardware, and adding a splash of color with Moroccan-inspired flooring tiles. Ben even says that it feels bigger and more open after renovating (a big plus in BK), not to mention that it&#8217;s much more functional. I love it, they love it, their friends love it, and little Enzo couldn&#8217;t be happier &#8212; sounds like a win!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great work to Aleks &amp; his team &#8212; and big congrats and many thanks to Ben, Therese &amp; Enzo!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Around the end of last year, Elliot, a Graphic Designer, and Katie, a Benefit Specialist, decided that the time had come to take the scary but sensible plunge and become first-time homeowners of an older 1,800 sq/ft, 2-story townhouse in Williamsburg. The couple fell in love with this house&#8217;s lovely bones, plus it had a backyard for their dog, Desmond; but what they did not love was that it had the common NYC problem of disjointed spaces caused by a layout of many smaller rooms, not to mention the interior&#8217;s outdated <em><span style="color: #000000;">everything</span></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the couple had never done a renovation before, they were excited by the idea of fixing up an older home. So the next task was to find their general contractor, which wouldn&#8217;t be easy (they thought) since they didn&#8217;t know many other homeowners, and therefore word-of-mouth was out of the question. After hearing about our resources at Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katie &amp; Elliot posted their project</a> right away to get matched with members of the Sweeten Network. After comparing their matches, the young homeowners chose to put their project in the trustworthy hands of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten general contractor</a> focused on sustainable design-building. The contractor worked with the renovation newbies to think through everything from the practicality of materials to overall design concepts, before beginning construction on their 4-month project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10650 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10651 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10652 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Katie &amp; Elliot&#8217;s first order of business was to re-do the kitchen so that they could finally enjoy eating-in, as much as they do dining out at their favorite neighborhood spot. Ecostruct enlarged the space by opening up existing entranceways and creating larger floor-to-ceiling cabinet systems. During demolition, Ecostruct&#8217;s team, lead by Jon Eklund, found that the existing plumbing needed to be replaced because it was not up to code (and was actually a ticking time bomb inside their walls). This added some extra time, expenses, and maybe a few gray hairs to the project, but both the homeowners and Jon&#8217;s team were confident that it was a problem worth solving right away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10653 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10654 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10655 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luckily, Elliot and Katie have similar taste when it comes to interiors. The couple wanted to create a home that had a warm, clean and modern feel with plenty of light. For the kitchen, they choose to use both recessed lighting and Caravaggio Matte Grey Pendant Lights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10656 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jon helped Elliot and Katie think about the new materials in terms of cost, aesthetics and sustainability &#8211; triple bonus! The couple picked Caesarstone in White Farina for their countertops which is known not just for its simplified fabrication and installation process that makes it budget-friendly, but also for its nonporous and scratch resistant qualities which will help it retain a perfect surface without sealants or waxes, keeping harmful toxins out of the home. For the floors, the couple went with Mirage Knotty Walnut floors throughout the living room, open kitchen and dining room. The wood adds nice warmth to the space and its natural irregularities make a nice contrast with the white clean lines of their kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10657 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10658 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether it was the mix of mid-90’s earth toned floor-to-ceiling tiles, black accented toilet seat, or the fact that the faulty old pipes in the walls were about to bust open, updating this bathroom was a must. I loved how, by continuing with the same color palette and general clean aesthetic of the adjacent kitchen, the bathroom  now reads as an integrated part of the home and less of a time warp.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10659 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/09_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/09_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/09_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The living room is tied both aesthetically and visually by opening up the island and updating the dry bar so the ever so hospitable Katie or Elliot can do what they do best, serve their lucky guests a cocktail while cooking up a meal in the kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10666 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the entry foyer, the homeowners had Jon&#8217;s team replace the front door and repaint the concrete flooring and wood staircase; they also hung a nice big <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/park-slope-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mirror that looks pretty familiar</a>. I really like the shabby-chic but very gender-neutral vibe of the foyer, which I&#8217;m sure is making many great first impressions for the Katie and Elliot&#8217;s visiting friends and family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks and congrats to Katie and Elliot! And a big thanks to Jon and his team at Ecostruct!</p>
