										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>In 2021, bathroom trends are breaking traditional rules about materials, style, and function</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48339 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-13.jpg" alt="Image of black and white geometric wallpaper in powder room" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-13.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-13-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-13-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />In 2020, we looked for a respite from the outside world. We needed to focus on self-care to help us navigate the stress of the pandemic. Enter the bathroom! It was a key spot to take time to ourselves, to relax with a glass of wine and a soak, or to nourish ourselves through daily beauty routines. Naturally, with a renewed focus on the bathroom comes the desire to renovate and refresh. Sweeten sees thousands of renovations a year, and in 2021, these bathroom trends are appearing in more and more homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>2021 bathroom trend: Doorless showers</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21435 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04.jpg" alt="Image of bathroom with walk-in shower " width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Walk right in! Homeowners are forgoing shower doors in their bathroom renovations. It&#8217;s all about the look and feel of the bath, and without a shower door to close off the space; bathrooms can appear larger and more luxurious. It can also help to make the space look fresh and contemporary. (One other upside: there&#8217;s also one less thing to clean!)</p>
<p>In the bathroom above, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovators Kate and Arthur </a>replaced the tub with a wet room—an open shower without curtains or doors—to keep the lines clean and open up the room.  Their Sweeten contractor included a wing wall to keep the water from splashing out. Other Sweeten renovators are following this trend too. Check out Sweeten homeowners, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/an-l-a-bath-remodel-reveals-wet-room-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liz and Kevin</a>, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brownstone-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giulia</a>, who designed their dream baths sans shower doors.</p>

<h3>2021 bathroom trend: Concrete bath counters</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34511 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06.jpg" alt="Image of bathroom with bathtub and concrete counters" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Traditionally, countertops in bathrooms have been ceramic, porcelain, or natural stone. Lately, there has been an uptick in the call for other materials, such as concrete. Concrete is seen as a major selling point as well as a way to modernize a space. It is durable and strong. You will need a fabricator and contractor to install it, however. And it is a bit more pricey than quartz or granite. But many think it&#8217;s worth it for industrial charm. Here, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovators</a> added it to their remodeling plans as a point of interest in their otherwise white bathroom.</p>

<h3>2021 bathroom trend: Whimsical wallpaper</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46962 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-13.jpg" alt="Image of black and white geometric wallpaper in powder room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-13-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Wallpaper is a great way to make a statement. It can be dramatic or subdued in color, texture, and pattern. Half-baths are the best candidates for wallpaper with a smaller footprint than a master bath. While many are concerned that steam would be an issue, there are <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wallpaper products made to resist</a> humidity.</p>
<p>Whichever type of bath you are looking to renovate, think about your design style and match it accordingly. These Sweeten renovators selected a black-and-white wallpaper for their powder room. &#8220;I wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all eyes to be on the geometric wallpaper,&#8221;</a> says homeowner Kirsty. &#8220;How could they not be?&#8221;</p>

<h3>2021 bathroom trend: Bold and black</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="gold-faucets-fixtures-in-white-bathroom" class="alignnone wp-image-48283 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-After.jpg" alt="bathroom with black walls and floating sink and toilet and gold faucets and fixtures after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-After-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-After-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Color is back and it&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">black!</a> Opposite to what many believe, using a black hue can actually make rooms look bigger because it allows the corners of the room to be undefined. And since they are not defined, it isn&#8217;t easy to tell where the walls start and end. In addition, black has a way of elevating a design. It is sophisticated and really matches any style decor—from contemporary to rustic.</p>
<p>For the bathroom above, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-bath-refresh-from-leaky-to-luxe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovator Veronica</a> decided to embrace the darkness of her space. “The bathroom got very little light to begin with, so I decided to embrace the cave-like atmosphere and go dark.”</p>

<h3>2021 bathroom trend: Medicine cabinet comeback</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brown-floating-vanity-black-floor-tiles" class="alignnone wp-image-44077 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-Richardson-blue-tile-bathroom-2.jpg" alt="brown floating vanity and large white sink in bathroom with clear glass shower door and black patterned floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-Richardson-blue-tile-bathroom-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-Richardson-blue-tile-bathroom-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-Richardson-blue-tile-bathroom-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Medicine cabinets used to be a thing of the past. However, today they are enjoying a newfound appreciation. In addition to many providing a mirror, they are great for storage. Homeowners choose them because mirrors are a necessity in the bath, so why not get some extra space for toiletries too? You can get one that is mounted on the wall like the <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/apartment-vs-house-a-brooklyn-family-decides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovator</a> did above. Or, you can have your contractor install an inset one so that the front is <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/88-year-old-master-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flush to the wall.</a></p>
