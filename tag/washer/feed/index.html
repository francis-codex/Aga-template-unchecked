<p>If you thought you couldn&#8217;t add a washer and dryer in an apartment, think again! Many homeowners have worked with Sweeten to make room for washers and dryers, even in small and unlikely spaces. <span class="s1">These renovations feature small laundry room ideas that work best in wet zones like a kitchen or bathroom with stackable or all-in-one combinations.</span></p>
<p>Is your home a candidate for an installation? Consider these details if you&#8217;re looking to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add a washer and dryer</a> to your home—<span>space, building approval, permits, electrical, and plumbing.</span></p>

<h3>Double duty: kitchen/laundry room</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44555" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-4.jpg" alt="washer dryer kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Beth and Bob Judge relocated to Manhattan after many years in the Midwest and the South. As soon-to-be empty nesters, they rented for a few years before finding a place that would fit their lifestyle—a co-op in a 1917 Beaux-Arts building. Part of their full-home renovation would include <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-check-all-the-boxes-apartment-for-empty-nesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laundry in the kitchen</a> as a must-have.</p>
<p>They spent a few years in Manhattan without their own washer-dryer, after enjoying full laundry rooms in suburban homes, &#8220;and we didn’t want to do that ever again,&#8221; Beth said. They were able to update the kitchen and add in a stackable unit with stainless-steel trim to complement the oven and dishwasher of the same finish. It blends in nicely next to the dishwasher, with cabinet space above for laundry accessories.</p>
<h3>All-in-one washer dryer</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jessica-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="small laundry idea in kitchen with combo washer dryer" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56230" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jessica-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jessica-Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jessica-Kitchen-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Homeowners Jessica and Alex rented in New York City for a few years before finding their dream apartment, which, not surprisingly for a 1930s co-op, needed renovating. The new <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/long-time-renters-shine-as-renovating-homeowners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen remodel</a> &#8220;was like putting together a giant puzzle,&#8221; Jessica said. &#8220;But it was good for our budget and timeline.&#8221; The kitchen includes an under-counter, all-in-one washer dryer, showing that even a small galley kitchen can include luxurious amenities.</p>
<h3>Accessibility as a priority</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-10.jpg" alt="washer and dryer" width="1000" height="655" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47295" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-10-300x197.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-10-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Mickey loved his Prospect Heights apartment. But after living there for 26 years, he felt he deserved an update. He got over his fear of renovation and turned to Sweeten for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/an-accessible-kitchen-and-bath-remodel-make-good-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gut remodel</a>. The kitchen would be overhauled and include a washer/dryer unit.</p>
<p>“My kitchen priorities were not typical,” says Mickey. “Having a washer and dryer in my apartment has been my dream for years.” But Mickey decided that it would be very convenient. He wanted apartment-sized units (really the only ones that would fit) on a pedestal with a counter above. This luxury ensures that he doesn’t have to bend down to fold the laundry. Although the plumbing needed some reconfiguring, it all aided in his look ahead towards accessibility and retirement.</p>
<h3>A perfect niche for a small laundry room idea</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/69496-Isis-Bathroom.gif" alt="small laundry idea with washer dryer and sliding barn door" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56229" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isis and Stephano&#8217;s</span> fourth-floor <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-brooklyn-brownstone-bathroom-gets-its-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brownstone bathroom renovation</a> took a backseat for other more pressing home repairs. But their<span style="font-weight: 400;"> small laundry room ideas were worth the wait. The space would borrow square footage from an adjacent closet. It would be large enough to move their existing washer and dryer in and double as a laundry room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But once again, they encountered another hiccup. Measurements were miscalculated and it was discovered the units would not fit in the space after all. Their Sweeten contractor came to the rescue reconfiguring the space to fit a 24-inch stacking washer/dryer unit. “It was like a game of Tetris,” said Stephano, describing their contractor’s creative space solutions.</span></p>
<h3>From alcove to laundry space</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41960" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05-585x878.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05-1170x1755.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-subway-tiles-laundry-niche" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48742" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-01.jpg" alt="White subway tiles and blue paint in bathroom and laundry niche with washer dryer after renovation" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-01.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>For their 953-square-foot studio loft in DUMBO, Brooklyn, Ashleigh and Jonathan desperately wanted to add a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/washer-dryer-bathroom-renovation-dumbo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laundry area.</a> The apartment didn&#8217;t come with a laundry hook-up, and adding one required more work than anticipated. Ultimately, it drove them to renovate the entire bathroom, taking space from a nearby alcove to allow for the stackable washer-dryer unit. &#8220;We’ve lived with and without a washer and dryer and much prefer life with one,&#8221; said Ashleigh. &#8220;So the fact that we could solve that problem with the apartment makes it infinitely more livable for us.&#8221;</p>
<h3>A ventless washer/dryer for the rescue</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/desperately-seeking-a-laundry-room/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-10.jpg" alt="white farmhouse sink and round vanity mirror near washer dryer in gray laundry room after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34634" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-10-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lynn and Craig</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> really didn’t want to carry their laundry up and down five flights of stairs in their apartment building. So they decided to add a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/desperately-seeking-a-laundry-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small laundry room idea</a> to their renovation list. The problem? No contractors were willing to take on the job of remodeling two tiny bathrooms, which included a washer-dryer installation. Then Lynn and Craig found Sweeten and hired a contractor who made it work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When other contractors told Lynn and Craig putting in a washer-dryer was not a viable option, their Sweeten contractor disagreed. Other contractors insisted the only way to install was to tap into the toilet line and disrupt the neighbor below. Not a good option. So their Sweeten contractor came up with a workaround. He used the small sink’s line, and the couple bought a compact, ventless washer/dryer. Lynn and Craig now have a convenient laundry room to call their own. </span></p>
<h3>A closet with a soapy surprise</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44272" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-laundry-17.jpg" alt="washer and dryer closet" width="1000" height="1498" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-laundry-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-laundry-17-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-laundry-17-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>When a family of five bought their <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/family-remodel-design-forward-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1,800-square-foot home in Manhattan</a>, they knew they wanted to redo the entire living space. They turned to a Sweeten general contractor and architect Jessica Wetters to open the space and enlarge the master bathroom. They also wanted a laundry area that would be functional while fitting the home&#8217;s contemporary aesthetic. To accomplish this, they hid a stackable washer-dryer behind closed doors in a closet. &#8220;We are thrilled with the results,&#8221; said the homeowner. &#8220;We achieved exactly the look and feel we were going for. I firmly believe that the process went as smoothly and efficiently as it did, thanks to our contractor, his crew, and our architect.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A small laundry room idea for a house</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Nadia-Laundry-16.jpg" alt="small laundry room idea with combo washer dryer" width="1000" height="1497" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56231" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Nadia-Laundry-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Nadia-Laundry-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Nadia-Laundry-16-600x898.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadia and Stephen&#8217;s search for a space</a> that would fit their multigenerational family landed them in a 2,030-square-foot brick rowhouse in Brooklyn&#8217;s South Slope/Greenwood Heights area. The house needed major work to meet the needs of all members of the family. They added a fully functional laundry area with a washer and dryer, which<span class="s1"> &#8220;also functions as a mudroom, with custom cabinetry and a pull-down drying rack where we can hang wet clothes,&#8221; says Nadia. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>If you thought this appliance was indispensable now, features like self-cleaning, an integrated sink, and a mini washer will wash your socks right off</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DavisonKitchen-06_Crop.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22857 size-chrono" title="washing machine" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DavisonKitchen-06_Crop-723x506.jpg" alt="washing machine" width="723" height="506" /></a>(Above) A washing machine tucked under the counter in Davison and Bernice&#8217;s kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doing laundry is unavoidable, but happily, washing machines are doing more of the heavy lifting for you. Digital controls, cycles tailored for everything from delicates to lycra to bath towels, vibration reduction, and childproof locks make wash day safer and less of a chore. While innovation breakthroughs have not gone so far as to make washing machines touchless, like some other appliances, there are more than a few new features that further reduce the time spent while increasing efficiency. Here’s a rundown:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The pros of front-loading</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The washing machine with the door that opens from the front, as opposed to the top, is not brand new; Europeans have enjoyed this feature for decades. However, it is becoming more widely available from manufacturers. The advantages: Front-loading machines require less water, can take more clothes, and tend to clean more gently and thoroughly than their top-loading counterparts. Top-loaders wash with the help of an agitator. Versions without the agitator are high-efficiency (HE) washers. Like front-loaders, they use less water, have larger capacities, require more time to wash, and spin faster, too, wringing out more water to save drying time later. They also cost more than the agitator version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Automatic dispensers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This receptacle releases detergent, bleach, and fabric softener, each at the appropriate time, so you don’t have to hang around waiting for just the right moment. Every minute saved is a minute you get back to do something else.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Self-cleaning and low maintenance</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Water will collect in the machine, particularly front-loading models, without evaporating if you wash frequently, creating a risk of mildew and bacteria. New technology now keeps washers fresh, without introducing chemicals, through a combination of soaking, pulsating, and high-speed spinning. And you thought self-clean was just for ovens!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23154 size-chrono" title="two-in-one washer and dryer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="washing machine" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) Tim and Lindsay&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/overhauling-upper-west-side-co-op-make-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-in-one washer and dryer</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Load capacity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Capacities for front- and top-loading machines can range from about 3.8 cubic feet up to 6 cubic feet. Your habits for doing laundry—weekly loads of towels or sports clothes versus say, small loads separated by color—will guide your decision. Larger capacity machines help cut down the number of washes you run. Expect to pay more for these models.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Steam wash</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Released from inside the washer, steam helps remove stains without pretreatment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Secondary access door</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have a top loader and you stumble upon that missing dirty sock, no problem. But what if your machine is a front loader? Now you’re in luck: Last year saw the introduction of a front-loading model with a secondary access door that lets you add small items mid-wash from Samsung.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-55-AFTER.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27425 size-chrono" title="washer and dryer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-55-AFTER-723x482.jpg" alt="washing machine" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) A <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-basement-turns-into-family-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">front-loading washer and dryer</a> in Cristiana&#8217;s laundry room located in the basement of her home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Integrated sink</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’ve ever soaked clothing with a pesky stain, you’ve probably had the experience of rushing with the drippy item from the sink to the washing machine, then going back to wipe up soapy water on the floor. No more. Samsung makes a top-loading machine with a hinged sink on top of the wash drum. A water jet aids the soaking or scrubbing; when the item is ready for the wash, lift the sink to drop the clothing through a slot at the back and into the machine, then begin the cycle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Two-in-one machine</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you like to wash small loads of a particular color, or can’t wait to launder those sweaty gym clothes; the two-in-one machine is for you. In addition to a central or primary drum, there’s another smaller drum at the base or top of the machine. You can run both washers simultaneously or independently, as needed. LG also offers a compact washer that can be retro-fitted to an existing machine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Black stainless steel finish</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Less industrial looking than its silvery-colored older sibling, black stainless steel makes a stylish statement in the laundry room, joining the ranks of ever-classic white, and some colors, too, which you may find on the market for a few seasons.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Meg and Brett had grown comfortable with their rental—despite its tiny shower, inadequate climate control, and chronic water problems—but dreamed of something to call their own. Having searched for years without success, they finally landed on just the thing: a spacious loft apartment in Hamilton Heights with a history. They went to work restoring some of the industrial charm that previous owners had plastered over with drywall, and the result is a stunning combination of original wooden beams, salvage finds, and touches of warmth that make an apartment a home. Read on for Brett’s take on how he worked with Sweeten to create the ideal space for his growing family.</i></span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Hamilton Heights homeowner Brett</span></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had been renting in NYC in different neighborhoods for many years, including most recently, our rental of eight years at the corner of 63rd Street and 2nd Ave. We loved our rental, but it had its share of problems&#8230;it would heat up like an oven in the summer, and in winter, it was so cold we could see our breath in the living room. It flooded every other year, and we could hear honking almost 24/7. It was imperfect but it was comfortable, and we loved it. We thought about purchasing a place for many years, but every apartment we looked at was a step down from where we were. Then we found it…the perfect place in the perfect neighborhood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">&#8230;after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment! </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment we found was an 1,800-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath condo loft in the historic district of Hamilton Heights. In an old carriage house that had been converted to residential lofts, the building was one of the few remaining carriage houses left in the city. We can track its existence back to 1903 from old ads in the Tammany Times, but I am sure it was built before then.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The place had been renovated not too long ago and was finished nicely. It had everything we ever wanted, and had we moved in as is, it would have been a huge step up from our current place. Most people would have moved in and not changed a thing. Our friends, our parents, and our brokers all thought we were crazy to even touch it. But after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as our vision was concerned, we wanted our loft apartment to feel high-end, but not stuffy or fancy. It should have a modern and clean feel to it, while still being classic and forever. We wanted to feel like we were on vacation when we were at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This place had a lot of history and interest to it, but we felt that the previous owner covered up a lot of the historical aspects, and aimed to expose them literally and figuratively. We describe it as smashing-a-modern-apartment-into-a-barn because that is kind of what we did. Attention wasn&#8217;t paid to trends, design rules, or motifs. We picked what we liked, and things that would be forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love watching &#8220;<a href="https://youtu.be/t221YNSCFLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open House&#8221; NYC</a>, our normal weekend activity, and saw an ad for Sweeten come on. Knowing that work needed to be done on the place, we thought of this as a good sign and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/8578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed up on the site</a>. Looking through their bios and past work, we found a few contractors who we were matched with that we liked. After speaking to three on the phone, there was a good feeling with one Sweeten design/build firm. His pictures showed he could do nice work, and he seemed like a straight shooter. We met with him at his office and got a quote on the scope of work. My wife and I liked the Sweeten contractor and felt him to be honest. We never got another quote or met with another contractor. His price wasn’t cheap but I didn’t want cheap work. I wanted someone I knew would do the job right.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I discovered during this renovation that developers will often square things off and use preset sizes for things to make the job easier and cheaper. After we did some demo, we found a ton of extra storage space just behind the sheetrock in the kitchen—and built an 8-foot-tall <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry</a> into the wall to the left of the fridge. Don’t be afraid to knock a few holes in walls. It’s all going to be painted anyway. After all, ours ended up being floor-to-ceiling in the kitchen which rivals most suburban pantries. Lastly, we recessed all the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a> except pendants over the peninsula, which we replaced with classic handblown Simon Pierce light fixtures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the exposed brick in the living room—which had 11-foot-high ceilings—and looked to continue the theme. We walked around and knocked on the drywall—if it felt hollow, we put a hole through to see what was underneath. This method allowed us to find original beams and columns all over the apartment and expose them. The wooden beams were original to the carriage house, whereas the iron beams were installed to support the original structure at some point in the building’s history. Some of the beams had initials in them, and we even found a horsehair or two caught in the wood!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wood-burning fireplace was originally wrapped in an ugly stone, so we wrapped it in black steel and replaced the mantle with a natural soapstone. Behind the fireplace, we built a niche for all the electronics and hung a TV above the mantel. We stripped the yellow varnish off the wide-plank oak <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a> throughout the loft apartment and refinished them with an eco-friendly, non-toxic, two-stage fuming process. The ceiling was painted the color of the sky—Benjamin Moore Grey Sky—and recessed LED lighting was added. A large custom table was built for the space by RE-CO Brooklyn from a single tree that fell during Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I found the tall ladder in the boiler room of an old factory in the Bronx. I work for a company that owns a few buildings in Hunts Point, and there are generations of industries and companies that have come and gone in those buildings. In my downtime, I like to explore the old abandoned spaces. Sometimes you can find the coolest stuff if you aren’t afraid to get a little dirty. The ladder was blackened from the fumes and probably at least 40 years old. I sanded it down and now use it to reach for items and to add some vertical interest. For the plant hangers, I used various industrial parts I found at a supply store to create a way to attach and hang plants to the beam.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, we went for a classic look: white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> with Carrara marble countertops and backsplash, with pulls and knobs in silver. The original kitchen cabinets had a shiny yellow wood finish that was not our style, so they were stripped down and painted in a nice white. Various sections were distressed to better fit the style of the loft apartment. The counters and backsplash are 3.5-inch-thick Carrara marble—the distributor said it was too hard to deliver and install such a thick piece in one slab because of the weight. But we insisted and they had to use 10 men to bring it in and install it! We also enlarged the sink with a Kohler stainless steel model. The range is a Bertazzoni Pro. Next to the sink is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mini-fridge</a> that is stocked with the same items you would find in a hotel mini-fridge—even things I don’t like!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, in the master bath, we went with a large 4-inch <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hex tile</a> in Carrara marble, with a simple white subway tile on the walls to match. I found our sink at an old steel warehouse in the South Bronx—it was filled with debris and pigeon poop at the time but was in surprisingly good shape. It’s a 48-inch Kohler slop sink circa 1948, and our Sweeten contractor was able to create a custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> underneath to fit the unusual shape of the sink. Our contractor also custom-made the mirror above to match.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the kitchen, we found space behind walls in the bathroom and created three linen closets. This room also holds the thing that I’m most excited about in the whole renovation: the shower. It’s spacious and comfortable—I had to duck down to get into our old shower and I’m only 5’8” on a good day. My wife’s favorite thing about the entire renovation is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer/dryer</a>! I didn’t even have to ask what it was…at our old building, the washing machines looked so old, I swear they ran on steam power. Clothes would come out dirtier than when they went in.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom, we redid the floor-to-ceiling closets with custom wooden doors and hid a TV inside. We also added custom wood shutters to the windows, which accentuate the unique shape of the windows. They are super deep, tall and arched. Without many good options, we concluded this was the best way to address the arch without ruining the architectural interest of the windows. As for the rest of the bedroom, it feels very serene and relaxing. Sleep is important to my wife and me, and we wanted it to feel like a retreat from the city. We didn&#8217;t want any industrial elements in here. We wanted it to feel refined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the entire process, our Sweeten contractor stayed on budget, which was very important to us. He completed the project within the time frame we discussed, even though I kept adding more and more work. He was pleasant to work with and fixed every concern or problem I brought up. Even after the project was complete, he repeatedly checked in and fixed a problem or two that was missed during the renovation. Now that we’re done, I’d say that the hardest part was staying on budget with a project of this scope. We kept finding more things that we wanted to do. My advice to future renovators is to anticipate this and to make a list of things that need to be perfect. Don’t be afraid to move backwards or sideways. Better to take your time, and get what you want than rush and end up with something subpar.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Last week in part 1</a>, we visited architect Tina and her husband Fletcher&#8217;s duplex in Cobble Hill. She gave us the tour of the kitchen and powder room on the upper parlor level. Now we&#8217;re back to view their bedrooms and master bath on the garden level. Here&#8217;s how the couple and their contractor transformed a level with lower ceilings and semi-subterranean location into a cozy and very chic space.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>, we decided to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinish</a> the dark wood floors throughout our duplex apartment to brighten the living space. It was especially needed in the bedrooms on the lower level. We ran into our first delay after work began on the floors. Initially, we selected a weathered oak finish, but our mistake was not testing it before moving forward. It wasn’t until after the entire lower level had been sanded and re-stained that we learned the red oak floors didn’t take the color as we had expected. To complicate things, we discovered the wood on the stairs was white oak, while the upper level floor was maple. The renovation timeline was delayed a week as we tested combinations of stains to find a neutralizing color that worked on all three wood types. Fletcher made the ultimate selection of Bona Grey, and we could not be happier with how it turned out!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The new floors immediately brightened the lower level of the duplex, which was key in disguising its semi-subterranean status. In addition to a lighter floor stain, we painted the bedroom walls with light colors—a cool gray in the baby&#8217;s nursery and a calming off-white in the master bedroom. White bedroom furniture, accents, and linens maintained the bright palette. To give the impression of larger windows, we added floor-to-ceiling sheer curtains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lower level had no base molding or traditional casing around the windows, and the interior doors styles were flat with concealed hinges, creating a sterile look. To introduce more character, we added base trim throughout the bedrooms and shaker-style panel doors. Our contractor helped us realize how cost-effective this strategy was. It was a low-cost improvement that made a huge impact. The garden level feels as comfortable and inviting as the upper living area.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We were already very pleased with the layout of the main bath, and found it was efficiently designed. Within a small space, it contained a tub—essential for our growing family—a large walk-in shower, and even a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washing machine and dryer</a> that already existed! It may have been more convenient to have them in a room where we could fold laundry, but we were happy to not give up significant apartment real estate. We just avoid running the ventless dryer while taking a shower. The amount of moisture in the room can become overwhelming!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the powder room upstairs, we kept the original Duravit fixtures, and were conscious of choosing materials that would make the space feel larger and brighter. This was especially important because we decided to tear out the existing back-lit vanity mirror that spanned the entire length of the main bath wall. And it was actually effective in making the room feel larger but we replaced it with a more traditional vanity mirror and sconce lighting. We continued the marble mosaic into the shower to avoid visually dividing the space, and kept the walls bright with the same Nemo white 2&#215;8 subway tile used for the kitchen backsplash.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to our Sweeten contractor and his crew, the renovation process was relatively quick and painless. By having the design decisions completed before work began, we eliminated on-the-go decision-making and were able to work with the team and budget effectively. We were happy to have a contractor with a calm disposition, who was extremely sensitive to our schedule and accommodating to hiccups in the process.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Although the work moved quickly, it wasn’t completed on schedule due to minor delays. Working with a tight timeline, there was little room for contingency. Our scheduled move-in landed just a week before our baby’s due date. As luck would have it, I went into labor early, on moving day!<span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because our kitchen cabinets had been delayed a few weeks, we returned from the hospital as they were being installed. We introduced our newborn to a home with appliances stacked in the living room and unpacked boxes occupying the rest of the apartment. We camped out as a family in the nursery (equipped with my college dorm mini-fridge) for a week while major work was being completed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two weeks after our move and into parenthood, the renovation was 95% complete. We unpacked boxes while the baby slept. Talk about exhausting! Looking back, transitioning was certainly hectic, but we couldn’t be happier with our new home. It is the perfect environment for our growing family.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Reimagine a woefully <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insufficient kitchen</a> for a busy Manhattan family in Morningside Heights</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: With only a single lonely cabinet under the sink, a rolling island from Ikea serving as extra counterspace, and two white-painted shelves, homeowner Janna resorted to stacking her family’s dry and preserved foods on freestanding shelving. “We joked that it looked like a corner deli,” she recalls. With an inadequately small refrigerator and two stove burners that needed to be lit by match, Janna was ready to reimagine her storage situation along with smart space planning for new appliances.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: The main hurdle was designing a plan more unique than a galley-style kitchen. Janna and her husband Jeremy credit their Sweeten contractor for being an enormous help in creating a usable space. A large new archway to the living room lets the cook keep tabs on family and guests while also making the kitchen look bigger. Removing an abandoned dumbwaiter contributed precious extra square feet, in which a generous walk-in pantry closet with a red door now sits. “Sometimes I just stand inside and admire it,“ Janna admits. A side benefit was that the extra storage allowed her to comfortably skip upper cabinets in favor of display shelves with integrated lighting for an airy vibe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">New walnut lower cabinets run below the exterior window, flanking the 24-inch Italian range. Not concerned with resale, they chose a teal-colored backsplash for a bold statement. Turning the corner, the L-shape ColorQuartz countertop serves as a pass-through and doubles as a laundry center thanks to a new washer beneath. Janna skipped an electric dryer to save space, preferring instead to hang-dry clothes. Also under the counter is a smaller dishwasher since their previous full-sized one was never fully utilized.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Though a splurge, the Elica pendant range hood increases air circulation without requiring wall-mounting like a traditional hood, which would have blocked the kitchen window.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Last year, Lindsay and Tim bought their first home together<i>—</i>a sprawling two-bedroom apartment on Central Park West. The couple—a medical student and financial analyst, respectively—saw the potential to create an incredible home for themselves, but had a list of renovation items to tackle first. With Sweeten&#8217;s help, they created a classic but thoroughly contemporary apartment with room to grow. By updating their existing kitchen and baths, they carved out new spaces for living, working, and entertaining. Read on for how they reconfigured walls to add an expanded office, a half bath, </i><em>AND bonus storage space </em><i>to their prewar apartment! </i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23151 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Upper West Side homeowner Tim Laurie</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After purchasing our first apartment together in June of 2016, my wife, Lindsay, and I decided to take on a co-op renovation in order to make it our perfect living space. We were attracted to the location and design of the 1929 Art Deco building on Central Park West, but the interior of the apartment left a lot to be desired. The 1,500-square-foot home offered a very spacious feel, with nine-foot ceilings and light coming through windows on three sides of the apartment. The layout, however, was dated and not very efficient. The “before” layout consisted of a cramped corner kitchen, large but divided living and dining spaces both of which had duplicate doorways on both sides, old en-suite bathrooms, and a dark walk-in closet converted to a cavernous office space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23304 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Before-and-After-Floorplans.001-720x540.jpeg" alt="Before and After Floorplans.001" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23305 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Before-and-After-Floorplans.002-720x540.jpeg" alt="Before and After Floorplans.002" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When planning the new layout, first and foremost, our renovation needed to address the practical features that were lacking. Specifically, we wanted: 1) a toilet that didn&#8217;t require guests to venture on an embarrassing trek through a bedroom in order to get to an en-suite bathroom; 2) more usable space, such as a den or optional third bedroom; 3) a washer and dryer in the apartment; and 4) a larger, but not galley-like, kitchen. With the help of Sweeten, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/10047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> and went with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contractor</a> that stood out as most reliable, reassuring, and within our cost estimate. We initially interviewed five contractors for our project, and received three quotes. Our contractor was not the least nor the most expensive, but he offered to include the finishing touches on our apartment to ensure we got the most out of our renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23378 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Manhattan renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-2-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23154 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23156 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23157 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest change in the kitchen was changing the entrance from a narrow doorway to a wide foyer and pass-through, allowing us to add a bar area, more counter space, and plenty of light. Our contractor helped us with the kitchen layout and where to place the washer/dryer so it connected to our water lines. We went with stainless steel Frigidaire appliances, adding a separate bar fridge under the counter to make up for a shallower built-in refrigerator that we chose. A stainless backsplash tile with white grout and slate gray floor tiles contrasts well with the white custom cabinets and brushed nickel handles throughout. We love the custom wine rack, glass cupboard, and bar shelf on one side of what used to be a duplicate doorway. A powder room—formerly small storage space—was also installed off the kitchen with double half doors, to take up less clearance space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23158 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23159 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of design, we wished to open up the main space by removing the mirrored french doors and a wall blocking the light between the living and dining rooms. For a modernized look, our plan included staining the hardwood floors, painting and papering the walls, and adding crown and floor molding. <span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">living room</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we removed the non-functional decorative plaster fireplace and the walls between the living and dining rooms to open up the main living space. A large dining room table from Pottery Barn (which nearly didn&#8217;t fit up the elevator) and chandelier sit between the bar and new office door. In this same area, we were able to build a third bedroom/den with french glass doors for light to shine through.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our en-suite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bathrooms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned out beautifully, with our master bath getting floor-to-ceiling tile in the shower and on the feature wall, as well as a custom-built vanity and top-mounted sink. The white, tan, and natural sand colors flow nicely into the main bedroom, which also got repainted. The guest en-suite bathroom is filled with clean white subway tiles and Carrara marble flooring, as well as an ebony vanity with matching Carrara countertop. Although the renovation progressed well from our standpoint, the contractors had their work cut out for them! They had to cut back old bathroom tiling and build new walls. We also had to replace old bathroom plumbing within the concrete deck floors, which was unexpected, but handled well by the subcontractors that our Sweeten contractor hired.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slightly expanded but cozy and carpeted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">office</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a bonus room for studying and work, accessible through the new matching french doors off the dining room, rather than from the bedroom hallway. The office neatly fits our double desk and two chairs, as well as a bookshelf. A new transom window in the hallway allows more light to shine through. </span>We were especially excited about a tweed Edinburgh gray wallpaper that we chose for the entrance foyer, which makes a big statement right when you enter the apartment. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least is the updated &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">garage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; where we leave the bikes, storage, and our cat&#8217;s litter box. This storage room was coated with a fresh coat of white paint and new gray tile as well, giving it a clean look despite its utilitarian purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Overall, we are very pleased with the renovation of our Central Park West co-op apartment. At the end, we decided to add extras along the way, which extended the project time frame by several weeks and stretched our budget slightly; however, our contractor did his best to complete these while not adding labor to the total bill. He was detail-oriented and very patient, despite a lengthy co-op approval process.</span><span class="s2"> The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team kept the work to a reasonable time frame of just over three months and were very understanding as we lived through the process.</span></p>
