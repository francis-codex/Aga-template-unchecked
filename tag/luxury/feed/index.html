<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Fix water damage and give the main-floor bathroom a facelift in Valley Stream, Long Island</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The problem with the first-floor bathroom in Marilyn’s 1950s home was twofold. While undergoing a separate renovation in the basement, the family discovered water damage in the bathroom that needed to be fixed ASAP. The subfloor was rotting out from what they assumed was pre-existing damage prior to their ownership of the home, plus a slow leak. Marilyn, a veteran renovator and construction manager, also wanted to give the bathroom a cosmetic facelift to make it more cohesive with the rest of her house. “I felt like my house was really modern (and totally my taste), and that bathroom was an eyesore,” Marilyn said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="beige-bathroom-with-pedestal-sink"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48884 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="Beige bathroom with pedestal sink and bathtub before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Eager to complete the renovation in time for Christmas dinner when plenty of guests would be in her home, Marilyn posted her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25914" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project on Sweeten</a> and was matched with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a> early in December. They tackled the water damage first by reinforcing joists and demoing the rest of the space, removing the bathtub, toilet, vanity, and old tile flooring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She had initially debated replacing the bathtub with a rain <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/luxury-shower-systems-steaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shower</a>, but it was the only bathtub in the house (and one her kids loved to use). Instead, she set out to find a deep tub that would add to the luxury feel of the space. “I actually had to get this special ordered, because it&#8217;s really, really deep and wide,” Marilyn said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marilyn spent an entire day at the tile store, searching for the perfect ones for the wall, floor, and shower. “I fell in love with the white subway tile, but I went with a gray grout,” she said. Along the shower and bath wall, she opted for a gray gradient tile, and then a pop of color in the storage niche with a turquoise that ties in with the wall color. The modern <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> boasts lots of storage for the smaller space, thanks to the large drawers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given her expertise and knowledge of the industry, Marilyn was very hands-on throughout the renovation and worked directly with her Sweeten contractor on finding, picking, and negotiating prices on materials. One of the biggest and only challenges they ran into was accommodating the oversized bathtub. “It’s almost like jutting out past the wall a little bit, but he was able to get a nice little silver trim just so everything looks kind of consistent. We had to shimmy things to make it straight,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The results were totally worth it and the project was completed just in time. “I absolutely love it. I get lots and lots of compliments from everyone who comes to my home, and it&#8217;s always really nice,” Marilyn said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Marilyn’s daughters are in love with the giant new bathtub. She said, “Both of my girls get in this big tub, and it&#8217;s like a little swimming pool for them!” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Bathtub, 21&#8243; deep: <a href="https://maax.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maax.</a> Hague 3-light vanity light, Maxted modern wall shelf, robe hook, toilet ring, and Kohler medicine cabinet, K-2967-BR1: <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>.
