<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Homeowner:</strong> Veronica posted her </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/home-remodeling-projects/new-york/new-york/10024/39852#after"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bathroom remodel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Where:</strong> Upper West Side in Manhattan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> Leaky plumbing expands to renovating the whole small space bathroom</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>With: </strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4810#overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Homeowner’s quote:</strong> “I was really looking forward to designing a bathroom that had a walk-in shower with a glass door.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with homeowner Veronica. &#8220;</i></span><span class="s1"><i>After&#8221; photos by Kate Glicksberg.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When commercial photographer, Veronica, moved into her Upper West Side apartment in 2014, she considered it move-in ready.  “All I had to do was paint and tile the kitchen,” she explains. “I hoped to redo the bathroom one day, but it seemed like an overwhelming and big job—and especially expensive in New York City.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="bathroom-with-pink-walls-before-renovation" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43856" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-before.jpg" alt="compact bathroom with single vanity and medicine cabinet and pink tiles walls and floor and bathtub before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-before.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-before-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cut to a few years later. She received a complaint from her neighbors directly below and after investigating, it turned out her tub was leaking into their apartment. “I had a plumber check it out, and he confirmed I’d have to get the tub replaced to fix the leak,” says Veronica. Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it), that meant the attached surrounding tile would need to be replaced. “It kind of became a domino effect of redoing everything, but I figured it was a good time to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make some upgrades</a>,” she says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veronica was more than happy to get rid of the outdated beige tile and grimy old jet tub and posted her project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>. “I was really looking forward to designing a bathroom that had a walk-in shower with a glass door,” she says. The light fixture didn’t work and the vanity was small and crammed in next to the shower so it was a no-brainer to replace those as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bathroom was transformed from a basic beige bathroom into a rich, modern space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Through Sweeten, Veronica found the contractor who would renovate her space with her vision in mind. “The bathroom got very little light to begin with so I decided to embrace the cave-like atmosphere and go dark,” Veronica says.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="shower-with-black-subway-tiles" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43858" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-6-dark-tile-walkin-shower-jpg.jpg" alt="bathroom with floating sink and gold faucet and fixtures and black paint on wall and walk-in shower with black subway tiles and glass wall after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-6-dark-tile-walkin-shower-jpg.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-6-dark-tile-walkin-shower-jpg-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-6-dark-tile-walkin-shower-jpg-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44130 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-bathroom-4.jpg" alt="Black bathroom tile" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-bathroom-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-bathroom-4-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added matte brass fixtures for warmth as well as marble floor tile for texture. “My favorite thing is the walk-in shower,” says Veronica. &#8220;It’s so much easier to clean, it makes the tiny space feel more open, and it gives a modern look and feel.” </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having a wall-mounted sink without a vanity also opened up the room. Veronica was &#8220;glad not to have crammed in an 18-inch vanity that doesn’t hold much anyway and visually disrupts the room.&#8221; Initially, the plan was to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-hung-toilets-look-behind-scenes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">install a wall-mounted toilet</a></span><span class="s1"> but found out that it was out of the budget and required permits.</span></p>
