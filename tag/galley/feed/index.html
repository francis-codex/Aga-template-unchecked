										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Original flooring sets the color tone, while hidden storage provide max capabilities</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-26840" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Treanna_Kitchen-02-07.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Treanna_Kitchen-02-07" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Adding storage and style to a haphazard kitchen in Manhattan’s Upper East Side</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When Treanna embarked on the search for her new home, she knew that apartments within her budget would probably require a remodel of some kind. She set out to find one in which she would only need to redo one of the two big-ticket items—the kitchen or bath—but not both. When she saw the kitchen in her current apartment, located in a 1960s co-op building on the Upper East Side, she spotted a lot of underutilized space and a lot of potential. There was enough room for a full galley, while the current owners had only one wall of cabinets and appliances with a lone undersized fridge on the other side. All the appliances were rental-grade, and there was no dishwasher—a must for this enthusiastic home chef. The few cabinets that existed were mismatched, and the space flow was not good. As she closed on the apartment, Treanna <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached out to Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted contractors, and selected her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: While almost everything in the old kitchen had to go, Treanna found charm in the existing checkered black-and-white flooring, and it became the basis for the new color palette. She envisioned a calm, serene space in white and gray—anything dark would make the galley space feel too confined. “Open, inviting, and warm,” were the operative terms for the updated kitchen design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the guidance of her Sweeten design-build contractor, Treanna chose white <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a>, a light-colored Caesarstone <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertop</a> with a bit of marbling, and a backsplash in clear and white tile (although the gray grout tinted the look of the clear tiles). Minimalist hardware in stainless steel finished the look. Working with just 42 square feet, Treanna and her contractor outfitted the space with ample storage by adding four custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-out racks</a> in addition to numerous drawers. The stainless steel range and dishwasher were installed on one side, while the microwave and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/refrigerator-chill-world-fridge-freezer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refrigerator</a> went on the opposite wall. Although the remodel took much longer than expected due to delays with co-op approval, Treanna is loving her new space—especially the pull-outs and the handy Delta touch faucet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Instead of wasting the dead space behind the cabinet toe kicks, the Sweeten contractor added additional drawer space and an ingenious pull-out step stool on wheels. Treanna had trouble reaching the top shelves in the kitchen and this was a way to keep a step ladder out of sight but easily accessible.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Cabinet hardware: <a href="https://www.simonsny.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simon&#8217;s Hardware &amp; Bath</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Revamping a kitchen&#8217;s original floor plans can take your space from workable to wow!</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a major kitchen transformation is your wish, going beyond swapping out kitchen cabinets or simply replacing existing features, you&#8217;ll want to enlist an architect to make changes to your floor plans.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Architects can see potential in the bleakest and most uninspiring places: Where we see darkness, they see spaces capable of being filled with natural light; where we see dead space and awkward cabinetry, they see new configurations and storage solutions. Whether you decide to work with an independent architect and a general contractor to execute your vision, or hire a design and build firm that can provide both architectural and construction services, chances are you won’t recognize your beautiful new kitchen once it’s done. Read on for five Sweeten kitchens that underwent an about-face in the best possible way.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24795 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerry and Janet’s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Crown Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking to find a fixer-upper that had a “bring your architect” vibe, Jerry and Janet came across a historic rowhouse that needed major work. After finding an architecture firm, as well as a general contractor, on Sweeten, they set their sights on updating the severely outdated home. New electrical, plumbing, and gas heating were installed throughout the rowhouse, followed by the framing of walls to create new floor plans. The kitchen was relocated to connect both the living and dining room, improving the flow of the home. Since the couple likes to cook, the space was laid out to allow ease of movement with plenty of counter space, and gray-toned IKEA cabinetry was installed to maximize storage space.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24796 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel and Eric’s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A spacious one-bedroom with loads of potential led Joel and Eric to Sweeten to find a general contractor for their renovation. One of their contractor’s references turned out to be <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowners and designers Casey and Kumar</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, who were brought on board to design the new space. The 1920’s-era apartment had a sunken living room, high ceilings, and lots of ornamental details—as well as a kitchen that was too small and dark. Updates to the floor plans were necessary, starting with a plan to connect the living room to the kitchen. Casey came up with the idea for a unified countertop, a piece that would serve as a bridge between the two rooms with a wraparound counter and plenty of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> underneath. The peninsula allowed the kitchen to feel much more open and inviting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24797 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="1085" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lia and Chris’ kitchen</a> in Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lia and Chris came to Sweeten to make over their two-bedroom, top floor unit with high ceilings, tons of light, and spectacular views. They chose to work with a design and build firm to address the outdated, open plan kitchen that looked out to the living room. The result provided more counter and storage space, filled in the odd angles and edges of the ceiling, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hid the fridge</a> for a more streamlined look. By far the most exciting part of the design included opening up the ceiling and exposing building beams in the living room for an industrial look, with the last exposed beam acting as a visual separation between the two spaces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20833 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sophia-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophia and Leon’s kitchen</a> on the Upper West Side, Manhattan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Natural light was not an issue in Sophia and Leon’s three-bedroom apartment—they had three exposures during the day that received a ton of light, but none of it ever made it into the kitchen due to its “bento box” layout. Working with a design and build firm that they found through Sweeten, they took down unnecessary walls that completely cut off the kitchen. The new floor plans included a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom-built</a>, open kitchen between the living room and dining room, allowing light to flow through the entire apartment. Open shelving on one side of the kitchen helped transition the space into the living area with storage for books.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24799 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="483" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tina and Fletcher&#8217;s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p>Not wanting a cookie-cutter apartment, architect Tina was drawn to a two-bedroom garden duplex with high ceilings and 10-foot windows framing the living room, a space that she was excited to customize for her family. With the couple’s first child on the way, any options that would require significant structural, electrical, or plumbing work were eliminated in order to cut down on both the permit approval and construction timelines. Tina completed her architectural drawings before meeting with contractors and decided to work with a Sweeten contractor who proposed an ambitious six-week timeline. Her main goal: to create an open kitchen by removing a floating, non-structural wall that had separated the space from the living room. New cabinets were continued around a corner, transforming the space from a narrow galley into an L-shape complete with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom kitchen island</a>. Semi-custom cabinets were designed around the existing appliances and maximized storage vertically.</p>

<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Integrated kitchen design, explained</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span>An integrated kitchen refers to a kitchen design in which components and appliances are integrated seamlessly into the overall design of the space. This type of kitchen often has a sleek and modern appearance, with clean lines and a cohesive look. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span>The aim of an integrated kitchen is to create a functional and stylish space that is easy to use and maintain. </span>Sweeten looks into this system called the integrated kitchen, sometimes referred to as a concealed kitchen. Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Before you shop, develop a plan for this specific cabinetry system. Any floor plan, from galley and L-shape to U-shape and open-concept can work. However, only certain appliance styles can be accommodated. F</span><span class="s1">loor-to-ceiling cabinetry lined up seamlessly can hide as much clutter as possible in an open-concept plan. </span></p>
<h4>Colors for an integrated kitchen</h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Choose a color and material scheme that is tonal, with smooth surfaces. The different areas blend into each other or at least transition quietly to create a harmonious living space.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you do have room for a dining table, try a banquette on the wall or in a corner if it’s available. Limiting the number of chairs will enhance the minimal effect and deemphasize a &#8220;kitchen&#8221; feel.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Minimalist kitchen remodel with white cabinets and hidden fridge" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone wp-image-47435 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></b><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> A concealed, minimalist kitchen in a</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenwich Village home remodel</a> with Sweeten</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Panels help hide appliances in an integrated kitchen</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">To some extent, appliances cannot be hidden completely, but certain features make them less noticeable. Consider the refrigerator. Counter-depth versions that are “panel ready” are available from a vast range of companies, including Sub-Zero, GE, Frigidaire, and KitchenAid. Replace the enamel or stainless steel front with a panel kit from your cabinet supplier, and the fridge, which no longer juts past the countertop, will almost disappear. Note that counter-depth fridges come as side-by-sides or top- or bottom-mounts, but they won’t have quite the cubic foot capacity of the freestanding or built-in models. In fact, they may be limited by as much as 2 to 5 cubic feet and up. If you have the room, you could add a refrigerator or freezer drawer that tucks discreetly under the counter.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Many dishwashers can also be fitted with a matching panel, or opt for an “architectural” version like those offered by manufacturers such as Whirlpool and Miele, which have controls concealed on the inside top of the door. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Panels can’t disguise stoves, cooktops, and ovens, but you can make choices that make these indispensable appliances less prominent. Go for induction cooktops that use a smooth, single surface with the heating elements concealed underneath. Digital controls (instead of knobs) also disappear when not in use. As for the vent hood, if you have a cooktop, you can get a downdraft that sits below the counter and pops up only when in use.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56602 size-full" title="integrated kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-19.jpg" alt="which is better kitchen peninsulas and islands" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Integrated</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen project</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">by Mitzie and Jenifer in Brooklyn</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Seamless kitchen cabinets</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">As the feature that typically takes up the most real estate in the kitchen, cabinets make or break the concealed look. European-style units open with gentle pressure applied to the outside of the door, making them a sensible choice for function and style. And hydraulic hinges on upper cabinets cause the doors to lift up and away with next to no effort. This type of sophistication comes at a price, however, so you might consider frameless doors and drawers, which completely cover the cabinet box, to suggest a seamless look. And where you can, take the cabinets up to the ceiling, to visually expand the appearance of the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Before you commit, research whether matching panels are available to fit your fridge and dishwasher. Your contractor can replace the existing panels easily. If you must add hardware, choose handles molded from one piece of metal, or doors and drawers that come with built-in channels that you can grab and pull.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Add outlets to the inside of some cabinets to create small appliance garages, with sturdy hinges that can raise heavy tools like mixers up and out.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Staging a sink in an integrated kitchen</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The sink will never disappear. However, if you choose an undermount sink, it will be less noticeable. An alternative: an integrated solid surface sink and countertop—virtually seam-free! The deeper the sink, the better it hides dirty dishes, of course. Some come with a cutting board accessory that tops the sink and creates an unbroken run of the countertop. Pair the sink with a touchless faucet for fewer visible details.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Concealing electrical outlets</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you use any small appliances or electronics in the kitchen (who doesn’t?), outlets are unavoidable. Minimize their appearance by choosing outlets that match the material or wall color—like with Lutron. When that isn&#8217;t possible, try grouping switches and outlets together to diminish their overall presence. Another strategy: tuck an outlet under an overhang of a countertop, or low on a wall near the top of the counter, where it can hardly be noticed.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Minimize obvious task lighting </b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Probably the easiest feature to conceal, lighting nevertheless deserves a little design attention. Use cans in the ceiling for ambient light, and hide those task lights by using LED strips below your upper cabinets. Do have some fun, however, with pendants over the sink or island and a chandelier above the dining table. This is the place to introduce some wit and individual style—essential ingredients for any successful room.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Make a Brooklyn kitchen feel inviting</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Snug like a ship, a galley kitchen will maximize function in the smallest of spaces. Renovating an efficient galley layout can be as simple as upgrading appliances, lighting, and architectural details.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The room was earth-toned and hardly the apartment owner’s style. Its dated ceramic floor tile was a drab-looking tan and had been laid with wide grout joints that collected dirt. An uninspired backsplash with ugly, inexpensive accent tiles came down onto a counter that looked like mud-speckled granite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: The owners love cooking and entertaining, so they worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3250" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten contractor</a> to remodel not just for function but also to make the kitchen more welcoming. Walls have been brightened with white paint, as has the old radiator cover beneath the window. New white cabinets are taller than the former ones, and a small soffit conceals the leftover space above, simplifying the lines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crisp white subway tile updates the backsplash, and floor tiles were replaced with resilient material. Under-cabinet lighting supplements new halogen track lighting in the center of the ceiling. The stainless steel stove has a stainless combination hood-and-microwave above, and the new dishwasher is a pleasant addition. Cabinets now surround an efficient stainless french-door fridge; its freezer drawer conserves the cool air that otherwise would be lost when you open the door of a side-by-side model.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a bonus, creative space planning allowed the owners to repurpose an adjacent windowed alcove as a second bedroom.</p>
