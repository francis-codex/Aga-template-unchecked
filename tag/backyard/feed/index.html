<h3 class="p1">Overhaul an overgrown urban garden</h3>
<p class="p3">Two years ago, we bought this 2,000-square-foot townhome, located between the Crown Heights and Prospect Lefferts neighborhoods. The attached single-family house was built in 1908, and we’ve been slowly working on updating it. Last year, with the pandemic grounding us at home, we got to work renovating our backyard.</p>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backyard</a> was a blank canvas. The previous owners had laid concrete slabs on the ground in the area closest to the house, but the space was otherwise covered in grass. We allowed it to grow wild our first summer here. The brush got so high that our dog, Sasha, would walk out and disappear. <span class="s1">We wanted to turn our barren backyard into a place that we—my husband, Henry, our son, Gavin, and myself—could enjoy.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h3 class="p1">Solving the rain problem</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Henry and I knew we wanted a deck with built-in seating, and we loved the modern look of horizontal fencing. </span>We liked <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bluestone pavers</a> and wanted to incorporate it. But our first concern was to identify and solve some engineering problems. We’d had a water issue in our fence-enclosed backyard since we bought the place—flooding whenever it rained. We needed a contractor who could fix that.</p>

<h3 class="p3">Seeking the right expertise</h3>
<p class="p3">The process of finding our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor was streamlined and direct. We posted our project and soon received a bid from a small firm we thought we wanted to hire. We threw out many concerns as well as ideas when we discussed the job with the contractor, and when <span class="s2">we saw his great sketches incorporating everything</span>, we knew he was the one we were searching for.</p>

<h3 class="p3">Designing an outdoor living room</h3>
<p class="p6">Once we had what we needed, the team began the work of reengineering the drainage system on our property. This made for a lot of holes in the ground, but they knew what they were doing and they ultimately solved the water problem. To create the deck, they drilled down in a series of spots, so large deck beams could be sunk into the earth. They then created a structural platform connecting the beams, which became the deck foundation.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s3">Our Sweeten contractor and his team were wonderful from beginning to end. </span>We’d decided on the raised deck to break up the flow of the backyard. We agreed there should be a clear delineation between the ground and the spot where you &#8220;step&#8221; up onto the deck, like an outdoor living room. Whenever they had an idea, they would either lay it out or draw it for us. <span class="s3">The result was a truly collaborative design that perfectly reflected our aesthetic.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3">Customizing a Brooklyn deck renovation</h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s4">Long boards were framed horizontally to create the high vertical walls. </span>The contractor came up with the idea of spacing between the boards, and we loved it.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s4">Atop the foundation they’d made, the contractors built <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/building-your-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the large platform deck</a>. Benches and planters were built around the perimeter. </span>They customized everything. The contractor had Henry and me sit on a &#8220;mock&#8221; bench and rest our arms with drinks to determine what height to build the side tables. The bench seat slides out to reveal built-in storage for pillows and gardening tools.</p>
<p class="p7">We picked a wood stain in a color we love—it gives the wood a mixture of brightness and warmth we were looking for. A small but impactful detail was that the design team chose nails in a similar color so it blended with the wood. I didn&#8217;t even realize that nails came in different colors.<span class="s4"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">We chose square, untextured slabs of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/nyc-landscaping-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bluestone pavers</a> to surface the area between the house and the step-up onto the deck. The backdrop is the beautiful old brick of the building behind us!</p>

<h3 class="p3">Loving our Sweeten construction crew</h3>
<p class="p3">The project manager and crew were great. We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a Sweeten contractor </a>who stayed in constant contact, giving us progress updates. <span class="s5">He was <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledgeable, detail-oriented</a>, and efficient, and he was also great with kids. </span>He informed us of any challenges we were running into ahead of time, so that Henry and I were mentally prepared. This helped us to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/nyc-landscaping-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make informed decisions</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Our Sweeten contractor shared everything from design and decor ideas to recipes and movie recommendations. The crew brought such great energy to our backyard that we missed them when work was complete.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Feeling beyond satisfied</h3>
<p class="p3">Now that our backyard is finished, we love everything about it. Having a private spot of green in the city feels like an absolute must. Our backyard is a sanctuary where we can relax, eat, drink, enjoy nature, <span class="s1">and </span><span class="s5">feel at ease.</span></p>

<p><em>Guest post by homeowner Michelle</em></p>
<h3>Finding the right contractors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My journey down the renovation rabbit hole began when I found myself picturing the dilapidated garage in the backyard as my dream “diva den,” as my best friend calls it. While researching different designs and models, I remembered an article on Sweeten I&#8217;d read a few years ago and had always wanted to use their services. It seemed like a no-brainer to have an intermediary help locate vetted contractors. It also solved the huge question of where to begin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since this was my first ever renovation project, I had no idea what my renovation would cost. Sweeten helped me modify my scope of work and nail down a realistic budget. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced me to a few contractors</a> who were a good match for my project. I finally felt like I had a team behind me, which is great once you start writing big checks.</p>

<h3>Planning the &#8220;she shed&#8221; garage remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I knew instantly that the first Sweeten contractor I met was the right fit for the job. Finally, I found someone as excited about my garage as I was! At that stage, I only had a basic idea of what I wanted. We took down most of the existing structure, retaining only the foundation. Since I was renovating a 12&#8242; x 19&#8242; garage, I wanted the interior to be basic and for the structure to retain the identity and functionality of a garage. That meant concrete floors, no molding, and a statement-making garage door. If you took out the rugs and furniture of the she shed, the structure could have use as a garage or workspace. I also wanted a calming space with one stipulation: no white walls.</p>
<h3>Experiencing a real-life renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with everyone on my contractor’s team was amazing. I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way. Most importantly, nobody exposed me for the complete novice that I was. Gaining an understanding of how everything worked also helped reign in some of my design ideas. To top off the contractor’s great service, he downloaded WhatsApp to stay in touch with me when I left for Cuba mid-project. I greatly appreciated his dedication to my peace of mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather was one of the biggest challenges during my project. It wasn’t an issue when my project started in August. However, when November arrived, it was either too cold, too rainy, or was supposed to rain but didn’t. Either way, there were a few bad weather days that halted work on The Shak. My contractor also had to juggle other clients. In my naiveté, I thought contractors worked on one project at a time. I came to understand that The Shak was my highest priority, but contractors work on other dream projects at the same time.</p>

<h3>Building a ladder to the attic</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the exterior took shape, and the interior work began, I became more involved in the project. That is also when my attention to detail heightened. For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage, we utilized the space</a>, we utilized the space above the ceiling. How to access that space became an hour-long discussion. I asked the contractor and his partner how I would get up to the storage space. &#8220;Use a ladder,&#8221; they said. &#8220;That’s what I do in my garage.&#8221; I’m no mathematician, but a nine-foot-tall ceiling plus a five-foot-tall girl does not equal easy movement of big boxes up a six-foot ladder. And where would I keep this ladder when I wasn’t using it? After a bit of selling on my part, they agreed to install an attic ladder. It was worth hashing out and in the end, my contractors loved the ladder too.</p>
<blockquote><p>I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Personalizing the &#8220;she shed&#8221; bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It may sound weird, but finding my dry-flush toilet was exciting. The she shed did not seem usable to me if you had to keep going into the house to use the bathroom. After endlessly searching for a toilet that did not need to be hooked up to sewage lines or have an odor, I came across a dry flush toilet. It is a great invention. It works like a Diaper Genie disposal system with a continuous bag that self-seals when “flushed,” then, a new portion of the bag opens for use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the bathroom is a small 3’ x 4’ space, I definitely wanted some over-the-top designs on the walls. I initially thought of using three-dimensional self-adhesive wall panels but decided against that since I wanted a mix of color and patterns. As a naturally curly-haired girl, the print I chose was a perfect fit for my preference of streamlined chaos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25844 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg" alt="garage bathroom remodel" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A tip on DIY wallpaper hanging</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, by the time I found the mural, the contractors had completed the interior space. So, my best friend and I enrolled in the university that is YouTube. After watching about twenty videos, we felt qualified to hang wallpaper, something neither of us had ever done before. I love what we accomplished, but some things take more skill and patience than she or I possess. I will never hang wallpaper again.</p>
<h3>Ultra-bold backsplash tiles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the contractor installed the sink and countertop, my <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next big project was the backsplash</a>. I wanted something different and eye-catching, something that would not bore me. I came across graffiti tiles but the designs weren&#8217;t bold enough. After feeling empowered with my new construction knowledge, I decided to decoupage my own tiles. We figured out the dimensions for the backsplash and measured out 5&#8242; x 2&#8242; worth of decoupage tiles as well as some purchased ones. It is one of my favorite things in The Shak. Now, when my friends come over, they all choose their favorite tile. I love how they invite interaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have never embarked on a project of this size. At times, it was scary. I would get a call at 8 a.m. from my contractor, asking <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which direction I wanted the French doors</a> to open or what size I wanted the windows to be, with no clue of how to respond. My advice to anyone starting a project would be to pick a contractor that listens to your ideas. It is also helpful to watch some YouTube videos, home improvement shows, or however else you like to educate yourself. The more a homeowner knows, the better he or she can direct the construction of their masterpiece. I couldn&#8217;t be happier with everything I accomplished in making The Shak a reality.</p>
<p><i>Thank you, Michelle, for sharing the story of your she shed, The Shak with us! We hope it brings joy and relaxation.</i></p>

<h3>Choosing between a house or apartment</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My husband and I used to live in Manhattan in a one-bedroom apartment. Once we decided to have children, we knew we wanted to live closer to our families. So we opted to buy a house in the Bronx and have our parents partake in child-raising. Originally we thought we would have one child, live in the area for a few years, and then move back to Manhattan once school started. </span></p>

<p><span class="s1">We were most excited about having a bathroom on the first floor and not having to go upstairs.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Our house addition plan: Envisioning more space</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, we soon fell in love with having a house and wanted to have more kids. Our neighborhood is quite ethnically and socioeconomically diverse. It feels like a nice mix, like we’re away from the city, but not quite in the suburbs. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We wanted more living space on the first floor because it’s where we spend most of our time as a family. We also wanted our children, who are 9, 6, and 3, to have larger bedrooms and decided to add a 250-square-foot attic dormer for that purpose. The idea was for the new space to be airy and maximize the view of beautiful trees in our backyard. Our 280-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement converted</a> into a ping pong room for extra recreational space.</span></p>

<h3>Transformation outside the kitchen</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, the window that previously looked out on the old deck was converted to a passthrough window that now connects to the new sunroom. The kitchen countertop was extended about two feet to the end of the wall that divides the dining area and kitchen. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Off of the kitchen, we added a 280-square-foot sunroom that includes a bathroom, pantry room, and living area. We were most excited about having a bathroom on the first floor and not having to go upstairs. The pantry provides tons of food, toy, and sports equipment storage. The new <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor deck</a> is off of the sunroom and is 250 square feet.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our favorite part of the renovation was working with the architect and our Sweeten general contractor on the layout of the new rooms.</span> <span class="s1">However, the most anxiety-provoking situation was waiting for support beams to be delivered and installed. For two days we had no roof and obsessed about checking the weather to make sure it didn’t rain! </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor had experience with all aspects of our project. He was great at giving us ideas and then executing the plan. We also shared the same taste in simple, modern, open design. He was able to deliver exactly what we envisioned. And if you need to file for city permits, our advice is to use an architect who can do that. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was great to have Sweeten follow up every step of the way. We knew Sweeten would be there if we experienced problems with our contractor. Luckily, we didn’t need that assistance. Our contractor’s team was excellent!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our new house addition space makes us feel less crowded. Now, our children can grow and play without feeling like we’re being swallowed up by all of their toys.</span></p>

			<h3>An overview of how to start planning for your outdoor remodel</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50622" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg" alt="Outdoor remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Sprucing up the out-of-doors</h3>
<p class="p1">Whether your outdoor space is seasonal or livable all year-round, having an exterior spot to relax is an upgrade in lifestyle and property value. You may be wondering how to make the most out of a rooftop deck or an urban backyard. Preparing for an outdoor remodel has many moving parts—some projects more complex than others. We break down how to begin planning and share a timeline so your green space can be ready by summertime.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>Decide on your outdoor space plan</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Santi, the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a> who transformed <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-expert-santiago/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K.V.’s backyard</a>, shared the following advice with us: “Just like any other project around the house, I recommend taking some time to decide what your goal is” for your outdoor space. Will you be using the space primarily for dining, grilling, gardening, or play? Decide what you want to prioritize: functionality or ornamentation. If there are kids involved, that will be a determining factor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Turning her attention to her brownstone’s backyard, K.V. knew she wanted to use the space to host friends and barbecues. She took inspiration from gardens in Mexico and Brazil, leaning toward a more tropical atmosphere. A tall cedar fence to provide privacy was a must-have.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31799 size-full" title="blue-floor-tiles-terrace-space" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg" alt="blue floor tiles in a terrace space with outdoor furniture and blue door after renovation" width="1000" height="649" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck-300x195.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck-600x389.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michelle and Nate remodeled <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their rooftop deck</a> to double as a &#8220;bonus room&#8221; for hanging out. It was outfitted with comfortable seating and plants to make it feel cozy. However, the rooftop felt open and exposed, so a visual barrier of plantings was placed along the perimeter. The couple also brought in a fire pit for chilly, late-summer nights.</p>
<h3>Be flexible with material choices</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">K.V. had her heart set on bluestone to create a walkway to the elevated patio in her backyard. “She had a budget she didn’t want to go over,&#8221; Santi said. &#8220;She asked us to price out bluestone, but it was a little too high, so we looked for other materials.&#8221; He added, “Homeowners should always price projects with different materials [because] changing the materials doesn’t mean changing the final goal or look of the design.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a surprise twist, they discovered bluestone buried under the dirt in the yard during demolition. K.V.&#8217;s backyard remodel paved the ground with gravel, pavers, and bluestone. While a budget might limit some choices, your contractor may be able to suggest alternative materials that fit the budget and achieve the look you want.</p>
<h3>Choosing plants for color, texture, and to enhance privacy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We asked Justin, a horticulturist at <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costa Farms</a>, to fill us in on how to choose the right plants. “The first and most important thing is to get a realistic sense of your area’s growing conditions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Consider the sun, moisture, and exposure to wind, and then pick plants that like or at least tolerate what your space has to offer.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those sunny spots, Justin recommends heat-loving tropical plants, such as hibiscus, mandevilla, and allamanda. In shady areas, birds of paradise and majesty palm are perfect for adding drama. Croton and colorful aglaonema provide a pop of color. If you choose plants that won’t survive the winter, keep them in a pot so you can bring them indoors when temperatures drop.</p>
<p>Nate and Michelle turned to landscaping to soften their space. Their landscape designer proposed lavender and feather reed grass to frame the seating area and a Japanese Maple tree. Justin also suggests other tall plants, like arborvitae, columnar juniper, and yew for privacy.</p>
<p>In K.V.’s yard, Santi filled in the spotty grass with fresh sod to transform the lawn into a thick green carpet. He also added a row of mulch along one wall for a small but manageable garden. Potted plants fill out the patio and walkway, providing color and texture.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32859 size-full" title="outdoor-plants-images" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace.jpg" alt="outdoor plants images" width="1000" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace-300x300.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />

<h3>Choose low-maintenance plants and automated irrigation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors, New Yorkers prefer outdoor spaces that are low maintenance. A landscape plan with a three-season oasis, automated irrigation in the morning, flowering shrubs during the day, and accent lights illuminating trees and fences at night would be ideal. If you find yourself unlucky in plant-love, Justin has some advice: “Coleus is a fun choice that thrives in sun or shade and has delightful, dramatically colored foliage you can enjoy from spring to frost.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Similarly, consider sweet potato vine: It spills down over the side of a planter, creating an elegant look. It also grows as a groundcover or can be trained to grow up a trellis or other structure,&#8221; Justin said. &#8220;Torenia, also called wishbone flower, is another option you can grow in sun or shade.” And if watering is your biggest concern, he advises planting mandevilla, lantana, angelonia, purslane, and evolvulus.</p>
<p class="p1">For the renovation, your landscape design should be set before demolition begins, said NYC-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5301#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Shenna</a>. “The design will determine where plumbing and electrical lines are run, as well as the rough-in for the sprinkler system,” she said. “These are laid down right after demolition.” However, there&#8217;s time with final landscaping choices. They get planted around the last month or so of the project.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>Plan your outdoor remodel in the off-season</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are looking to remodel a green space, start planning and working in the off-season. For those not ready to plant or are just building up towards a green thumb, use the warm seasons to find inspiration, and plan during winter.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a typical timeline to guide you. Pro tip: Start the process early. Use the summer months prior to gather inspiration. In the fall, begin mapping out the design, landscaping, and materials with an architect/designer/contractor. “Planning, designing, and finalizing the fine details of the project can take months,” said Shenna. This gives the contractor enough time to work with the homeowner and/or designer to get all of the pieces in place.</p>
<p class="p1">By December, permits should be submitted, your contractor hired, and materials ordered (keep delivery times in mind).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Demolition should break ground by March/April for an outdoor remodel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“The best time to physically start working on an outdoor space is in the spring.” said Shenna. “The weather makes it possible to get everything prepped and ready.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02.jpg" alt="Backyard deck area with horizontal wooden fencing and barbeque grill after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50569" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h4>Managing the outdoor remodel infrastructure</h4>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6256#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor</span></a> Mike, who is based in NYC said, “The scope of the project, the square footage of the outdoor space, and material delays” will affect how much time goes into the planning phase in advance. Depending on the complexity of the project, an outdoor remodel typically takes two months to finish. However, an outdoor kitchen that requires plumbing, gas, and electrical could take longer for approvals than a deck remodel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an outdoor space, there’s a lot more to consider, like drainage. Your general contractor should have an in-depth understanding of how bulk water will be managed and how your plans will impact the neighbors. If you’re working on a roof, make sure you have access points for clearing roof drains.</p>
<h4>Organizing material delivery and approvals</h4>
<p class="p1">Your team will also have to haul all of the materials to your outdoor space. Hauling roof deck lumber, soil, sod, and plant matter up through service elevators can be costly and time-consuming. An alternative is booming materials to the roof by crane. Contractors usually have partnerships with local greenhouses and lumber yards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>They can move materials from the street to a garden more efficiently and cost-effectively than using a service elevator.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, make sure you have the necessary approvals. Most exterior improvements will require an alteration agreement and approval from the building&#8217;s architect, and many will require filing with the city. If you live in a landmarked building, special regulations will apply.</p>
<p class="p1">Start and plan early with the right professionals onboard. A well-planned deck or garden can greatly increase the value of a property. It will be time and money well-spent. When you’re ready to get started on your outdoor remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</p>

			<h2>From condo to brownstone overhauls, a few of our favorite projects in the neighborhood</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Distinguished by its deep cultural and historic roots, Bedford-Stuyvesant, (aka Bed-Stuy) is a sprawling area also known for 19th-century brownstones, festive block parties, community gardens, and a lively culinary scene. Dough Doughnuts, anyone? The ever-changing neighborhood offers the best of what’s old and new, making it a place worthy of settling down and staying for a while. See how Sweeten renovators did just that and made Bed-Stuy home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32893 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-05-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, living room, brownstone" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having their hearts set on a Brooklyn brownstone led <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellamy and Zak</a> to a two-family home in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Restricted by the home’s layout and their budget, the couple focused on the structural changes that would most impact the flow. They flipped the house to make the top two floors the owner’s duplex and renovated the garden floor as the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-rental-in-a-brownstone-gets-fashionable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rental property</a>. Removing doors in the main entryway instantly opened up the space and created a larger living area. Two walls were torn down to expose the full length of the home—and two mismatched walls—which led to repointing and experimenting with painting techniques.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24342 mb-0 size-chrono" title="ktichen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, kitchen, renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/teacher-writes-lesson-kitchen-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ursula</a> loved almost everything about her recently converted two-bedroom condo—except the kitchen. Between the dark mahogany cabinets and flooring, the room felt anything but open. The space was revamped with white glossy cabinets, a geometric backsplash, and a sleek hood where the microwave used to be. Ursula and her Sweeten contractor got strategic when it came to storage: the new island featured three drawers for silverware, cutlery, and dishes, and they made the most of an underutilized area next to the oven by installing a pull-out spice rack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29885 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-11-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedforod-Stuyvesant, living room, brownstone" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It all came down to location during <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marsha and Adam’s </a>house hunt for their family. They searched across Brooklyn and at one point, New Jersey, before realizing the borough was the place for them. The two-family home they finally found in Bedford-Stuyvesant offered the space and light they were looking for, and just had a “good feeling about it.” A full renovation proved necessary to bring the 2,000-square-foot townhouse up to snuff. Taking inspiration from their #1 must-have—white oak floors—the couple set out to create a simple, clean vibe to carry throughout the home, including the all-white kitchen. The rest of the project centered on knocking down walls to open the living room, dining area, and kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_KV_Yard-03-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20478 size-chrono" title="backyard" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_KV_Yard-03-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn backyard, renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>Every New Yorker’s dream? An outdoor space to call their own. Inspired by the gardens of Mexico and Brazil, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-expert-santiago/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K.V. Harper</a> set out to turn the once unusable outdoor space behind her two-bedroom Bedford-Stuyvesant duplex into a lush retreat for entertaining. A framed cedar fence became the defining element of the oasis, encompassing different seating areas and gardening plots. Another fun bonus: The crew found bluestone during the demolition and repurposed it to build out a pathway leading to the yard.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-25524 noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25524 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedford-Stuyvesant, renovation, brownstone, home design" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-15-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-15.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry</a> weren’t expecting a gut renovation when they purchased their single-family home in the Bedford Historic District. While trying to sort out the mechanicals and ductwork, however, they came to the realization starting from scratch would be more efficient overall. To build a home that would grow with them over time, accommodate guests, and most importantly meet their day-to-day needs as a family, they set priorities. For him: the bells and whistles necessary to create a smart home, and for her, the flow and design crucial to making the house fit their lifestyle. The result?
