<li><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Homeowner&#8217;s quote:</strong> &#8220;You never felt like you were just being fit into their day. We felt like priority clients,” said Tracey. And Sweeten “was great. They checked in regularly to see how things were going and made sure we knew they were available for any and all help.”</li>

</ul>
<p><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowners Tracey and Stephen </i></span></p>
<h3>The existing kitchen made it impossible to entertain</h3>
<p>For years, Tracey Dixon and Stephen Neverson and their three young children were always renters in New York City. But in a confluence of difficult and emotional events—the deaths of Tracey’s parents (just three weeks apart after 42 years of marriage), which led to some inheritance money, followed closely by the sale of their apartment by their landlord—pushed them to decide to purchase a place of their own.</p>
<div></div>

<p>While the ‘40s attached rowhouse in Brooklyn’s East Flatbush had enough space (1,930 square feet), it also had a kitchen with a drop ceiling, wood paneling, an unsightly ceramic floor, and a sink that was falling apart. “We entertain a lot, and the kitchen blocked us from that. The stove was crooked because of the floor, and there was a thick layer of grease on everything that would not come off. The pipes were old as I don’t know what,” says Tracey, a freelance violist who runs the private Dixon String Studio and avid cook with a culinary degree. “I wanted a <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/the-411-on-kitchen-cabinet-door-designs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern, bright, clean design</a>.”</p>
<p>Tracey and Stephen, a high school guidance counselor,<span> </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a><span> </span>to<span> </span>Sweeten, and planned a renovation<span> </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with their chosen contractor</a>.</p>
<h3><b>A chef-ready kitchen with everything a family needs</b></h3>
<p>While Tracey wanted her<span> </span>chef’s kitchen, she didn’t want it to feel sterile. “This is a home, not a restaurant,” she said. “And the kitchen is the center of our home.” The design combines her love for both modern and Japanese aesthetics.<span class="s10_overlay-text"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/16433-Tracey-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="Galley kitchen with white countertops and backsplash" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/16433-Tracey-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/16433-Tracey-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/16433-Tracey-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The dishwasher and stove were the two things Tracey was looking forward to the most. “We are a family of five and a dishwasher is crucial,” she said. The stove is “beloved. It allows me to create. I needed more power out of my stove. In our last apartment, it took me 100 years just to boil water for pasta,” she said.</p>
<p>During the renovation, Tracey said she became a “microwave cooking queen.” It was difficult to navigate the renovation with three small children and all their appliances sitting in the living room. But they couldn’t eat out all the time. “I discovered I could make lovely broccoli and fabulous rice in the microwave!” Tracey said.</p>
<p><span class="s10_overlay-text"></span><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tracey_spice_rack.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-54033 size-full" /></p>
<p>Once they put everything back into the new kitchen, they were glad they had pull-out drawers for the recycling, spices, and oils. “There is so much storage. We also have two open-shelving spaces, which I just love,” she said.</p>
<h3>Learning lessons during the Brooklyn remodel</h3>
<p>If they ever renovate again, she’d know to “save for the renovation and the padding around it. The incidental costs caught us off guard. We factored in some, but not all. We were still able to get everything done, but we definitely could have benefitted from more financial padding.”</p>

<blockquote><p>
We were still able to get everything done, but we definitely could have benefitted from more financial padding.
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Planning the next remodel</h3>
<p>The couple loved working with their Sweeten contractor and designer on the remodel of their Brooklyn kitchen. “They were the absolute greatest,” Tracey said. “The level of professionalism was top notch. They did everything they could on this project. The kitchen was completely gutted and done in five weeks. They worked hard and were consistent. You never felt like you were just being fit into their day. We felt like priority clients.” And Sweeten “was great. They checked in regularly to see how things were going and made sure we knew they were available for any and all help.”</p>

<p>Now that it’s all over, Tracey is looking toward their next possible project. “The outdoor deck is definitely in our future renovation plans for our lifestyle.” She is daydreaming about a deck with Portuguese tiles, maybe a partial patio, and a grassy area. “Nature is important, necessary, and dear to me,” she said. “My family and guests need to have an option of green in our urban landscape.”</p>
<p><span><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Tracey expresses her love and nurturing through food. “Just a few weeks ago, the added counter space allowed me to show my brother some cooking tips because he has a new love for cooking. Food binds our cultures and our lives together,” she explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Emily moved to New York City last year, she went in search of an apartment with a warm, old-world feel. Although originally from California, she had recently spent two years living and studying in Normandy, France, where she developed an appreciation for beautiful prewar buildings that wore their age gracefully. Emily loved that the apartments she came across there—no matter how small or simple—always had ornamental features that elevated the space. Paneling, vintage doorknobs, and other small details contributed to an overall elegance, and she wanted the same for her new apartment in New York.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21355" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-21349"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A six month-long search resulted in the purchase of a 435-square-foot studio apartment in an understated 1940s building on the Upper West Side. It was a prewar apartment but also a condo, a rare combination that suited Emily’s criteria. Although it was a studio, it had distinctly separate spaces: an entryway, dressing area, kitchen, bath, and main living space, which Emily liked. Unfortunately, having been used as a longtime rental property, the apartment had been stripped of most of its original ornamentation. Instead, there was paint a dozen layers thick and worn flooring throughout the studio. In the narrow galley kitchen, there were sticky off-white cabinets, peeling vinyl floors, and almost no counter space at all. The very peachy-yellow bathroom sported tiles that didn’t match in spots where they had once been replaced, and a tank-less, industrial toilet gave the small space an unpleasantly institutional vibe. To the left of the front door, two shallow closets took up valuable floor space, which Emily felt would be better utilized as an office nook.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21368 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-02" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21367" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-01" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Emily envisioned a restoration of sorts: she wanted to add paneling and crown molding to the walls of the main living space, and to create a simple bath with a vintage black-and-white theme. The kitchen would be modern but befitting the age of the building. And although the discrete spaces of the apartment were a major selling point, Emily felt that the narrow kitchen would be much improved if it could be opened up to the main living area. Pinterest provided ample inspiration, and she set out to source the materials herself, relying heavily on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a> and other online stores.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having developed a concrete plan for the renovation, Emily and her dad, John, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> to Sweeten. John had had substantial experience with construction and renovation in the past, and with his input, Emily settled on a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. The crew quickly went to work realizing Emily’s vision, and also provided helpful suggestions and additions along the way. For example, unprompted, the contractor stripped a half-century of paint from the front door, revealing the beautiful metal patina underneath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on Emily’s direction, he created a pass-through from the galley kitchen to the living area, extending the counter through the opening to create a breakfast perch with stools. Open shelving made of marble and brass took the place of upper cabinets, creating more room to breathe in the narrow space. The appliances and sink were lined up on the left, given that the counters and base cabinets on the right were a mere nine inches deep. (The entire kitchen was just about six feet wide!) An under-counter refrigerator, paneled to blend in with the cabinets, preserved the new airiness of the space. Sadly, there was no room for a dishwasher, but a 24-inch gas range fit perfectly at the end of the counter. Finishes were consistent with those found in older buildings, featuring white subway tile, marble counters, brass detailing, charcoal gray lower cabinets, and blackened metal light fixtures with a retro feel. For the floor, Emily chose a fun Spanish tile in black and white.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the original dressing area, the floor space was expanded once the closets were removed. Custom shelving and a desk were cut to fit inside the nook perfectly, creating a cozy home office away from the main sleeping area. In the main room of the studio, her Sweeten contractor added small details that restored elegance to the apartment. Marble ledges on the windows, as well as wall paneling, crown molding, and new baseboards transformed the space in subtle but distinct ways. The bathroom received a similarly unpretentious and classic treatment: white subway tile with a beveled edge and black trim, matched to a matte black towel rack. To prevent an accidental burn and to disguise an unsightly floor-to-ceiling radiator pipe, he suggested that they wrap it with rope.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21359 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-05" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21355 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21410 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-12-1-723x997.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="997" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21356 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-02" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21357" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-03" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, unlike many of Sweeten’s renovating homeowners, Emily and John managed the project from afar—they were in California while her contractor and his team worked on her apartment. They arranged for check-ins via FaceTime or Skype, and he provided photos and updates on the work on a regular basis. Despite the 2,500 miles between them, there were remarkably few hiccups on this Sweeten project. Emily and John attributed this to good communication with the contractor and his team, but also to the fact that they went into the process with a firm plan, and sourced the materials for arrival prior to the start of the job. Emily’s advice to future renovators: “There is a lot that can go wrong when you’re renovating, but it helps to start with a good idea of what you want. And if you source the materials yourself, you can cut down on some of the variables that might delay the project.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks so much, Emily, and we hope you’re enjoying your lovely new-old studio!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years after Claudia purchased her one-bedroom, one-bath apartment in a quaint Upper East Side co-op, she felt ready to renovate. Since arriving in 2001, this software engineer knew that she’d eventually need to address the 30 year-old carpeting, fixtures, and odd space issues&#8230;or simply move on and find a new home. Loving everything about the building, the neighborhood, and her lifestyle, she decided to stay put and find a designer who could bring an architectural approach and a restorative eye to this lovely space. Read on for the stunning reveal of Claudia’s thoughtful and personal apartment renovation!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18472 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg" alt="apartment renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-18306"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia first readied herself with a straightforward list of tasks she wanted to accomplish. Sure, the place hadn’t been updated anywhere in three decades, so finishes throughout were more than dated. But she also craved more space, and after seeing neighboring units without the built-ins and boxy windows that had been added in a mid-80s renovation, she realized she might be able to reclaim some hidden square footage (and long-missing electrical outlets) in her own unit. The kitchen and bathroom needed a complete treatment, and the living room and bedroom required diametrically opposed designs: out with chunky built-ins on multiple walls in the living room, and in with a thoughtful and multi-functional built-in for the windowed bedroom wall.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18334 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18333 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18336 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-05" width="600" height="797" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-05-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18335 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-04.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-04" width="600" height="797" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-04-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18332" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishlist near complete, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claudia decided to post her project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2531" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was matched with a Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who specializes in creating architecture and interior design solutions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon meeting with Frederick and his team, Claudia made an overarching goal clear: She wasn’t interested in solely installing modern finishes over the old. The original bones were just as important as the final coat of paint. That pristine 1929 appeal needed to show through and reveal itself via new design details. With extensive renovations planned in every room, Claudia moved out of the apartment temporarily to allow for Frederick and his crew to get started. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia believed that original parquet floors were hiding underneath all the carpeting, and she was right. Frederick had the wood floors sanded and refinished, bringing them back to life without introducing any new materials. With extra sheetrock walls encroaching in multiple directions, the team chipped away at the wall of boxed windows, disposing of an 18 inch layer of brick and wood. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avert your eyes if you live in a typical NYC co-op, because you will probably NEVER experience this, but somehow Claudia nearly doubled the size of her living room windows by combining them, flooding the space with lovely natural light. All of the windows were replaced with double-paned versions, up to code with the building and boasting the required heat, freeze and UV protections. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the opposite end of the room, the crew stripped away the ever-so-slightly-asymmetrical built-in shelving and cabinetry to reveal an open, wood-burning hearth. Claudia turned to a local Italian couple who specialize in old world mantels for an understated limestone facade, and Frederick brought in a specialist to design and install crown moldings along the doorways, windows, ceiling and floor boards throughout the apartment. Claudia’s mother helped source the final touch: an accent wall in a serene, neutral palette is an elegant and stylish addition to an inviting new living room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the kitchen, Claudia knew she wanted a white kitchen and was unsentimental about getting rid of the “horrible” gray linoleum floors. Cosmetic features aside, she wanted more storage space and a way to install an exhaust fan over a new cooktop. In an attempt to carve out some casual eating space, the previous owners had put some very limited cabinetry along the left-side of the galley, and appliances took up most of the storage and prep space on the right side.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claudia chose a small pearlescent stone tile in a melange of pebble hues to take the place of the severely dated synthetic floor she’d grown to detest. High-impact cabinet changes were custom fit into the small space. Claudia worked with an Italian purveyor specializing in hidden compartments for the fridge and hood, and managed to conceal all of the major stainless steel appliances except for the striking new Bertazzoni range, because, Bertazzoni! The laminate countertops were removed and replaced with a white Caesarstone slab and corresponding backsplash, and an undermount stainless sink&#8211;supplied by the same producer as the cabinets&#8211;was installed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18452 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="white Caesarstone countertop" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18453 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18454 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="stainless undermount sink" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18455" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-08-10.gif" alt="Bertazzoni range" width="600" height="797" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia knew she didn’t need to change the footprint of her bathroom to incorporate the many features she wanted here. The tub needed two shower curtains to keep water in, the full surround of blue-gray tile muted natural light, and the bulky vanity was topped with a throwback plastic ball faucet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia went with a floor tile pick that is complementary but different to those used in the kitchen, and with Frederick’s help, incorporated extra pieces into a design detail border along the wall of freshly installed white subway tiles. The tub came out and was replaced with a slightly larger and more modern German piece to coincide with new spa accessories: a rainwater shower head plus a handheld option for added luxe. The fixed shower rod was taken down to make way for a glass partition and hinged glass door that swings out for maximum function and style. Claudia chose a pedestal sink for extra floor and knee space, opting to place storage behind hidden cabinets in the wall instead. Almost all of the bathroom features were handpicked from local design shop Elegance in Hardware, including the polished nickel door knobs, which are exclusive to the outlet.  </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bedroom, Claudia and her design-build team pursued the opposite approach. Instead of doing away with built-ins, they found areas where custom additions would have a meaningful impact on space use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They added a custom closet in the hallway, outfitted  by California Closets, just outside the bath before entering the living room and introduced this same custom storage concept in the bedroom, behind a mirrored closet wall—one of the only major features that remained. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the carpet was torn out in the bedroom, Claudia approached Frederick with her hopes of incorporating a window seat before new wall treatment and molding went in. The designer re-enlisted his subcontractor to fashion a custom wooden seat built right into the new shelving set. The homeowner would just need an upholstered cushion and good book to make it complete.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18464 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-21.jpg" alt="bedroom renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-21.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-21-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18465" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="window seat" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-22.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-22-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia revealed to us that upon visiting her apartment, after the renovations were complete and the dust had nearly cleared, she stood and looked around the empty rooms and was filled with the sense that nothing had changed. It was as if she were apartment shopping in 1929, which, she explained, is exactly what she wanted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18466" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-23.jpg" alt="upholstered cushion" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-23.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-23-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Here on the Sweeten blog, we aim to translate insight from NYC renovators and contractors into information you can use to make better decisions about improving your home. One surprising lesson we&#8217;ve learned from more than a few great kitchen renovations is that appliances don&#8217;t have to fade into the background of a beautiful space &#8211; they can play a starring role. The stove, in particular, is a workhorse fixture that can double as the centerpiece of a thoughtful kitchen, sometimes even worth designing around altogether, and a big signal of a newly-renovated kitchen for anyone who might be looking at re-sale value. This week: we&#8217;ve rounded up a few of those unlikely &#8220;star&#8221; kitchen stove appliances from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> renovation projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/glam-stoves-unlikely-stars-in-6-kitchen-renovations/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14400 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/inspiration_stoves.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/inspiration_stoves.jpg 580w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/inspiration_stoves-300x196.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a><span id="more-13713"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Starring Kitchen Stoves</h3>
<h4><a href="https://www.subzero-wolf.com/wolf/ranges/gas-range/30-inch-gas-range" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolf Gas Range &#8211; 30&#8243;</a></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instantly recognizable for its signature red knobs, the Wolf Range is made of stainless steel and has four surface-sealed burners and dual-stacked low and high heat settings. <a title="Dan and Mike’s Manhattan Kitchen Renovation — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan and Mike in Hell’s Kitchen</a> coordinated cookware and cutlery to match the bold red color against the warm backdrop of natural and synthetic wood finishes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13725 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04.jpg" alt="Wolf Range Kitchen Appliance" width="600" height="625" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04.jpg 573w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04-288x300.jpg 288w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h4><a href="https://www.vikingrange.com/consumer/index.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking 3 Series Gas Range &#8211; 30&#8243;</a></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Viking Range has become synonymous with performance. The 3 Series Gas Range has five surface-sealed burners and self-cleans by burning off residue in the oven. <a title="Before &amp; After: Robyn and Alejandro’s Columbia Waterfront Industrial Kitchen — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/before-after-robyn-and-alejandros-columbia-waterfront-industrial-kitchen-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robyn and Alejandro in Brooklyn’s Columbia Waterfront district</a> oriented the entire design of their brand new kitchen around this sparkling Viking model.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13739 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed-11.jpg" alt="Viking Range Stove Kitchen Appliance" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed-11-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://us.bertazzoni.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bertazzoni Master Series Gas Range &#8211; 30&#8243;</a></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Made in Italy, the Bertazzoni Master Series Gas Range is a dominant player in the high-end stove world. The cooktop has four dual-ring (outer and inner) surface burners which control flames and distribute heat more uniformly. <a title="Bernice &amp; Davison’s Upper West Side Kitchen Renovation — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-and-after/bernice-davisons-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernice and Davison on the Upper West Side</a> topped off their imported Italian porcelain floor tiles with a Bertazzoni Gas Range to complete their kitchen transformation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13726 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_DavisonKitchen-01.jpg" alt="Bertazzoni Master Series Range Kitchen Appliance" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_DavisonKitchen-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_DavisonKitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h4><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/appliances/oven-ranges/NX58H9950WS/AA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Gas Range &#8211; 25&#8243;</a></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Samsung Gas Range keeps sophisticated techies in mind with its intuitive and sleek touch-screen control panel. The flexible cooktop has five surface-sealed burners as well as a large capacity oven to accommodate multiple dishes at once. <a title="Before &amp; After: Lee’s Midtown East Kitchen and Bath Renovation — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-and-after-lees-midtown-east-kitchen-and-bath-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lee in Midtown East</a> swapped in a new Samsung stove that complements the seamless IKEA cabinet lines in his minimalist kitchen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13783 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-061.jpg" alt="Samsung Stove Kitchen Appliance" width="600" height="428" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-061.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-061-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h4><a href="https://www.capital-culinarian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capital Culinarian Gas Range &#8211; 30&#8243;</a></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike some gas ranges with surface-sealed burners, the Capital Culinarian Range is an outlier known for its high-BTU open burners that provide maximum control and even heat distribution – excellent for wok cooking and stir-frying. An <a title="Five Design Tricks Transform an Uptown Kitchen" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/five-design-tricks-transform-uptown-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upper East Side family</a> that loves to cook selected a Capital Culinarian range with an understated “British racing green” finish for ultimate function and durability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13782 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_UES-03.jpg" alt="Capital Culinarian Gas range kitchen appliance" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_UES-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_UES-03-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h4><a href="https://www.whirlpool.com/kitchen/cooking/ranges/single-oven-freestanding/p.5.8-cu.-ft.-freestanding-gas-range-with-center-burner.wfg540h0es.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whirlpool Gas Range – 30”</a></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Whirlpool gas range offers a more vintage and relaxed look with five dual-powered burners and edge-to-edge cooking grates that span the entire cooktop. Inspired by Scandinavian design, a <a title="Scandi in Brooklyn: Sweetened Clinton Hill Co-op Renovation" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/scandi-brooklyn-sweetened-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton Hill couple</a> installed a simple, white Whirlpool stove for a more austere, low-tech feel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13795 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-11.jpg" alt="Whirlpool Gas Range Stove" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-11-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
