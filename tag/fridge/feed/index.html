			<h2>Let your fridge blend neatly into its surroundings with these paneling ideas</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet with paneling in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-44899 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things you notice in a kitchen is the refrigerator. It is big and usually holds souvenir magnets, wedding invitations, or to-do lists. With more homes featuring open-plan layouts, their size and boxy shape interfere with the visual harmony. </span>Paneling and built-ins help disguise a hidden fridge cabinet by integrating it with cabinetry. The look of the entire kitchen is unified.</p>
<p><span class="s1">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he homeowners below pulled off the ever-popular &#8220;refrigerator in cabinet&#8221; design trend with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help of their general contractors</a> from Sweeten. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3>A designer seeks visual harmony</h3>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet in blue kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56510" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<p><span class="s1"></span>Furniture designer, Mitzie and her partner, Jenifer, chose blue and white for their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrated kitchen</a>. The entire space was simplified and unified from what it had been—outdated with a variety of closets. After laying out mood boards and careful planning, a more pleasant transition was created since it opened to the living space. While the <span class="s2">hidden fridge cabinet</span> blends in with the kitchen cabinetry, two symmetrical closets flank the main kitchen—one is a closet, and the other hides the washer and dryer.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Compact size with a hidden fridge cabinet</h3>
<div></div>
<p class="p1">After renovating all of the rental units in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brownstone they purchased</a>, Janet and Jerry kept the 600-square-foot top unit as a pied-à-terre. Scandinavian minimalism and California casualness meant the sight lines throughout the home would have few vertical disruptions. This would apply to the kitchen too. To emphasize the open and airy studio, they hid all appliances in cabinets. The washer/dryer combo, refrigerator, and pull-out freezer all fit under the countertop.</p>
<h3>A custom touch for a fridge</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinets with waterfall island and brown cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56511" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/for-an-east-hampton-beach-house-a-simple-plan-to-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">East Hampton kitchen</a>, homeowners Jennifer and Alex wanted to keep the redesign simple but inviting. They chose to add a large island for entertaining and splurged on a wine fridge and quartz countertops. To make the design more modern, they decided to install an integrated refrigerator, which streamlined the look of the cabinetry.</span></p>
<h3>A hidden fridge cabinet finds a niche<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_04-05-GIF.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></h3>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_04-05-GIF.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27986" title="paneled fridge nestled within a column" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_04-05-GIF.gif" alt="refrigerator paneling" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Ainsley and Simon’s architect discovered that the column in the kitchen was merely decorative, they came up with a plan </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-lightens-up-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to tuck the refrigerator inside</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of it and add custom panels. “You don’t look at it and think it is a fridge at all,” Ainsley said</span><b>.</b></p>
<h3>A seamless built-in</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31161 size-full" title="blue-kitchen-custom-cabinets-light-floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" alt="blue kitchen custom cabinets and light floor overlooking the living area after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren’s front door led </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly into the kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She had to choose between a traditional entryway or a hybrid space that would add square footage to the kitchen. She chose the latter and added a seamless wall of cabinetry featuring a refrigerator in a cabinet, plus a pantry and a coat closet.</span></p>
<h3>A wall of closets<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet in kitchen with white built ins" width="2560" height="1707" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48230" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To improve the flow between their living and kitchen space, Tara and Brian’s contractor came up with an idea to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">move the refrigerator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a wall already outfitted with closets. Now the refrigerator fits right in with the cabinetry, instead of jutting out in the main cooking space.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46413 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-PostRenovation.png" alt="Post a Renovation Project" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-PostRenovation.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-PostRenovation-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3>A hidden fridge cabinet around a structural column</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Casey-fridge-gif-no-watermark.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22901" title="white-long-cabinets-long-handles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Casey-fridge-gif-no-watermark.gif" alt="white long cabinets with long steel handles diving white living room with open book shelf after renovation" width="1000" height="666" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casey and Kumar’s apartment is full of </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clever storage solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to maximize their limited space. The kitchen is one such example thanks to creative built-ins. Custom cabinetry covers the refrigerator along with a neighboring pantry, while the entire unit conceals a structural column.</span></p>
<h3>A clever closet-turned-fridge idea</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet with paneling in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scandinavian chic was the look that homeowners Roxana and Gabriel were going for in their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/">Long Island City loft</a>.  They turned to a Sweeten contractor who was able to update their space to match their minimalistic style. </span><span class="s1">The refrigerator, which moved from the main kitchen area into what was formerly a coat closet proved to be one of the biggest challenges. They had to find the right size appliance and custom cut the Ikea panels to fit.  </span></p>
<h3>A hidden fridge cabinet unifies the kitchen</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44900" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an open concept living arrangement was the biggest goal for this Manhattan couple. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-cool-and-contemporary-kitchen-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took down the dividing wall</a> between the kitchen and family room and replaced it with a custom unit with storage on both sides. It was really important to the couple that they fit a fully integrated Sub-Zero refrigerator and other standard-sized appliances. “They [general contractor team] worked with me through a few kitchen iterations until we found a great open layout that permitted full-size appliances,” the homeowner shared.</span></p>
<h3>A puzzle of panels</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40347" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1496" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05-600x898.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less like appliances, more like furniture—that was Sally’s directive for her kitchen renovation. Her contractor built out a wall of cabinets to hide <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/integrated-white-kitchen-jackson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the refrigerator</a> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a pantry. A set of narrow units were designed to hold brooms and mops, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re ready to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get started on your kitchen</a> or home remodel, discuss with your Sweeten contractor how to incorporate a seamless kitchen.</span></p>

<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to make your fridge look like a cabinet</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">There are several ways to make your fridge look like a cabinet. One way is to buy a panel-ready refrigerator, meaning a fridge that comes pre-fabricated with a panel already on the door, making it look like a set of cabinets. A built-in fridge has a depth of a typical kitchen cabinet–about 24 inches–which keeps it flush with kitchen cabinets once installed, creating a seamless look.</p>

<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to hide a fridge in a kitchen</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">To hide a fridge in a kitchen, consider the fridge itself: can you use a built-in or panel-ready fridge? These types of appliances are created to fit seamlessly with cabinets, avoiding the typical protruding fridge look, and come with panels mounted to the front, mimicking cabinetry. Some homeowners are able to hide their fridges within decorative columns, closets, or other empty spaces within their kitchen.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Meg and Brett had grown comfortable with their rental—despite its tiny shower, inadequate climate control, and chronic water problems—but dreamed of something to call their own. Having searched for years without success, they finally landed on just the thing: a spacious loft apartment in Hamilton Heights with a history. They went to work restoring some of the industrial charm that previous owners had plastered over with drywall, and the result is a stunning combination of original wooden beams, salvage finds, and touches of warmth that make an apartment a home. Read on for Brett’s take on how he worked with Sweeten to create the ideal space for his growing family.</i></span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Hamilton Heights homeowner Brett</span></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had been renting in NYC in different neighborhoods for many years, including most recently, our rental of eight years at the corner of 63rd Street and 2nd Ave. We loved our rental, but it had its share of problems&#8230;it would heat up like an oven in the summer, and in winter, it was so cold we could see our breath in the living room. It flooded every other year, and we could hear honking almost 24/7. It was imperfect but it was comfortable, and we loved it. We thought about purchasing a place for many years, but every apartment we looked at was a step down from where we were. Then we found it…the perfect place in the perfect neighborhood.</p>

<p class="p1"><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">&#8230;after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment! </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment we found was an 1,800-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath condo loft in the historic district of Hamilton Heights. In an old carriage house that had been converted to residential lofts, the building was one of the few remaining carriage houses left in the city. We can track its existence back to 1903 from old ads in the Tammany Times, but I am sure it was built before then.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The place had been renovated not too long ago and was finished nicely. It had everything we ever wanted, and had we moved in as is, it would have been a huge step up from our current place. Most people would have moved in and not changed a thing. Our friends, our parents, and our brokers all thought we were crazy to even touch it. But after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as our vision was concerned, we wanted our loft apartment to feel high-end, but not stuffy or fancy. It should have a modern and clean feel to it, while still being classic and forever. We wanted to feel like we were on vacation when we were at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This place had a lot of history and interest to it, but we felt that the previous owner covered up a lot of the historical aspects, and aimed to expose them literally and figuratively. We describe it as smashing-a-modern-apartment-into-a-barn because that is kind of what we did. Attention wasn&#8217;t paid to trends, design rules, or motifs. We picked what we liked, and things that would be forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love watching &#8220;<a href="https://youtu.be/t221YNSCFLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open House&#8221; NYC</a>, our normal weekend activity, and saw an ad for Sweeten come on. Knowing that work needed to be done on the place, we thought of this as a good sign and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/8578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed up on the site</a>. Looking through their bios and past work, we found a few contractors who we were matched with that we liked. After speaking to three on the phone, there was a good feeling with one Sweeten design/build firm. His pictures showed he could do nice work, and he seemed like a straight shooter. We met with him at his office and got a quote on the scope of work. My wife and I liked the Sweeten contractor and felt him to be honest. We never got another quote or met with another contractor. His price wasn’t cheap but I didn’t want cheap work. I wanted someone I knew would do the job right.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I discovered during this renovation that developers will often square things off and use preset sizes for things to make the job easier and cheaper. After we did some demo, we found a ton of extra storage space just behind the sheetrock in the kitchen—and built an 8-foot-tall <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry</a> into the wall to the left of the fridge. Don’t be afraid to knock a few holes in walls. It’s all going to be painted anyway. After all, ours ended up being floor-to-ceiling in the kitchen which rivals most suburban pantries. Lastly, we recessed all the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a> except pendants over the peninsula, which we replaced with classic handblown Simon Pierce light fixtures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the exposed brick in the living room—which had 11-foot-high ceilings—and looked to continue the theme. We walked around and knocked on the drywall—if it felt hollow, we put a hole through to see what was underneath. This method allowed us to find original beams and columns all over the apartment and expose them. The wooden beams were original to the carriage house, whereas the iron beams were installed to support the original structure at some point in the building’s history. Some of the beams had initials in them, and we even found a horsehair or two caught in the wood!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wood-burning fireplace was originally wrapped in an ugly stone, so we wrapped it in black steel and replaced the mantle with a natural soapstone. Behind the fireplace, we built a niche for all the electronics and hung a TV above the mantel. We stripped the yellow varnish off the wide-plank oak <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a> throughout the loft apartment and refinished them with an eco-friendly, non-toxic, two-stage fuming process. The ceiling was painted the color of the sky—Benjamin Moore Grey Sky—and recessed LED lighting was added. A large custom table was built for the space by RE-CO Brooklyn from a single tree that fell during Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I found the tall ladder in the boiler room of an old factory in the Bronx. I work for a company that owns a few buildings in Hunts Point, and there are generations of industries and companies that have come and gone in those buildings. In my downtime, I like to explore the old abandoned spaces. Sometimes you can find the coolest stuff if you aren’t afraid to get a little dirty. The ladder was blackened from the fumes and probably at least 40 years old. I sanded it down and now use it to reach for items and to add some vertical interest. For the plant hangers, I used various industrial parts I found at a supply store to create a way to attach and hang plants to the beam.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, we went for a classic look: white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> with Carrara marble countertops and backsplash, with pulls and knobs in silver. The original kitchen cabinets had a shiny yellow wood finish that was not our style, so they were stripped down and painted in a nice white. Various sections were distressed to better fit the style of the loft apartment. The counters and backsplash are 3.5-inch-thick Carrara marble—the distributor said it was too hard to deliver and install such a thick piece in one slab because of the weight. But we insisted and they had to use 10 men to bring it in and install it! We also enlarged the sink with a Kohler stainless steel model. The range is a Bertazzoni Pro. Next to the sink is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mini-fridge</a> that is stocked with the same items you would find in a hotel mini-fridge—even things I don’t like!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, in the master bath, we went with a large 4-inch <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hex tile</a> in Carrara marble, with a simple white subway tile on the walls to match. I found our sink at an old steel warehouse in the South Bronx—it was filled with debris and pigeon poop at the time but was in surprisingly good shape. It’s a 48-inch Kohler slop sink circa 1948, and our Sweeten contractor was able to create a custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> underneath to fit the unusual shape of the sink. Our contractor also custom-made the mirror above to match.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the kitchen, we found space behind walls in the bathroom and created three linen closets. This room also holds the thing that I’m most excited about in the whole renovation: the shower. It’s spacious and comfortable—I had to duck down to get into our old shower and I’m only 5’8” on a good day. My wife’s favorite thing about the entire renovation is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer/dryer</a>! I didn’t even have to ask what it was…at our old building, the washing machines looked so old, I swear they ran on steam power. Clothes would come out dirtier than when they went in.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom, we redid the floor-to-ceiling closets with custom wooden doors and hid a TV inside. We also added custom wood shutters to the windows, which accentuate the unique shape of the windows. They are super deep, tall and arched. Without many good options, we concluded this was the best way to address the arch without ruining the architectural interest of the windows. As for the rest of the bedroom, it feels very serene and relaxing. Sleep is important to my wife and me, and we wanted it to feel like a retreat from the city. We didn&#8217;t want any industrial elements in here. We wanted it to feel refined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the entire process, our Sweeten contractor stayed on budget, which was very important to us. He completed the project within the time frame we discussed, even though I kept adding more and more work. He was pleasant to work with and fixed every concern or problem I brought up. Even after the project was complete, he repeatedly checked in and fixed a problem or two that was missed during the renovation. Now that we’re done, I’d say that the hardest part was staying on budget with a project of this scope. We kept finding more things that we wanted to do. My advice to future renovators is to anticipate this and to make a list of things that need to be perfect. Don’t be afraid to move backwards or sideways. Better to take your time, and get what you want than rush and end up with something subpar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Read this handy primer, from door types—french door refrigerator or bottom freezer—to cool tech and features. Fruit-infused water dispenser, anyone?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24391 mb-10 size-chrono" title="refrigerator" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12-723x534.jpg" alt="refrigerator" width="723" height="534" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12-723x534.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12-300x222.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12-600x443.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span class="img-label">Kristen’s FrenKristen&#8217;s French door refrigerator bottom-mount freezer in her <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/gallery-director-perfectly-curates-apartment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovated Chelsea kitchen</a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s probably the most frequently visited place in your home. It’s the hub of the kitchen. It’s the refrigerator. No other appliance sees so much action. To keep up with all of the demands made on this hard-working member of the household, manufacturers are devising new features and improvements to provide more flexibility and responsiveness. From precise climate control to wireless connectivity, the refrigerator has even greater capacity to keep food fresh and to alert you when items need replacing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While some of these innovations may not be mandatory to a functioning kitchen, they are nevertheless time-saving. They also happen to be fun.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><b>Door configurations</b></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The arrangement of doors and drawers on your refrigerator, or refrigerator/freezer, are not just a style choice. The configuration directs how you use the fridge, and what foods you reach for most often. Classic arrangements still exist—side-by-side, bottom-mount, column—as well as newer styles, like French door and drawers. When choosing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">style</span></a>, first make a checklist of all the things you and your family take from the fridge in a given day. Each configuration has its benefits:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">*Side-by-side</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Giving access to the freezer on one side and the fridge on the other, this type is the most popular category now. The tall slender doors are also good for kitchens with little clearance space. The narrower sides do mean you lose the capacity to stow wide items like pizza boxes and party trays.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">*Bottom-mount freezer</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the freezer on the bottom, the main compartments remain at eye level, a no-brainer when the fridge is accessed more frequently than the freezer. For those times when you need the freezer just as often—during a big party, over the summer, or for frozen snacks—some fridges with two upper doors can be reprogrammed so that one side becomes the freezer, temporarily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several manufacturers, like <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/home-appliances" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LG</a>, <a href="https://www.geappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GE</a>, and <a href="https://www.mieleusa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miele</a>, offer double lower freezer drawers; one of the drawers can be converted to a fridge or freezer as needed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*French door</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A variation of the bottom-mount freezer category, this model features two half-doors that open from the center (like a side-by-side), also good if you have less clearance when a door opens. You’ll still be able to get the full-width shelves in the inner compartment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*Column</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This refrigerator comes in a variety of widths so it can be installed wherever you want for a customized kitchen layout. Add a column freezer next to it or a couple of under-counter freezer drawers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*Door-in-door</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frequent opening of the fridge door is inevitable. This leads to strain on the cooling system and a risk to food placed at the front. If yours is the family that goes in and out all day for drinks, check out the fridge from LG with the upper door that opens with the push of a button to access a slender outer beverage compartment. A tinted glass panel lets you see inside with two knocks on the glass, for those who like to graze with a gaze while deciding what they want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*Drawers</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Undercounter</a></span><span class="s1"> refrigerator drawers are handy for a variety of situations, including small kitchens without much wall space, as well as a large kitchen requiring more fridge capacity for dedicated items, like drinks and snacks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*Top-mounted freezer</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This type falls into the most economical category (remember your starter apartment?). However, it offers the least capacity, and you have to bend over to retrieve most items in the fridge. Not so cool.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cooling for all</b></span></p>
<p id="m_6442250483863752054yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1497642992296_10103">The constant opening and closing of the fridge places a burden on the cooling system of the refrigerator and on the food inside. The variety of items also presents a challenge, as not all perishables keep well at the same temperature—or even together in the same drawer. Some foods, placed together, can even speed each other’s spoilage.</p>
<p id="m_6442250483863752054yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1497642992296_10105">Manufacturers have responded with independent humidity and temperature control for compartments. Miele makes a refrigerator with drawers that offer individual microclimates. With the touch of an icon, the drawer will keep lettuce crisp one week and safely store cheese another. Jenn-Air has a quick-chill feature that lowers the temperature to below liquid freezing for one hour, great for that spur-of-the-moment bottle of wine.</p>
<p id="m_6442250483863752054yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1497642992296_10196">Some new fridges come with separate cooling circuits for refrigeration and freezing sections. The benefit: Independent control of each section contributes to peak function. Since there’s no air exchange between compartments, it also keeps food from drying out. <a href="https://www.subzero-wolf.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.subzero-wolf.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1497730836836000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9637qnK0KHCvDfmC45nx5IwTHQg">Sub-Zero</a> has introduced an antimicrobial filtration system that clears airborne bacteria and prevents the transferring of odors or ethylene gas (emitted by some vegetables) that can speed food spoilage.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Connect with your appliance</b></span></p>

You might also be able to access recipes from a popular cooking site and have the recipe read to you as you work at the prep counter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><b>Ice and water perks</b></span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Water and ice in the door aren’t new, but new functions have been added, including:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* Ice cubes small enough to fit into refillable water bottles</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* Ice and water dispensed at the same time</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* Shaved ice, perfect for smoothies or seafood platters</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* Remote manufacturing of ice ordered from your mobile phone</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* An integrated compartment that holds fruit for infused water</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* High-capacity ice maker</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Probably no other appliance in the kitchen can combine so many innovations as the refrigerator. The future points toward the development of more special features, some that we can’t even imagine yet. In the meantime, you can, at a minimum, enjoy state-of-the-art cooling systems that save you money on electricity and grocery bills. And that’s always cool.</span></p>

<p>The fridge is easily the most-used appliance in the kitchen, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be the centerpiece. With <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom paneling</a>, your fridge can blend into its surroundings and let another feature, like a standout <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island</a>, take center stage.</p>

</a>Photo: Sub-Zero/Wolf</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is so much talk today about creating a “smart home”—since the kitchen is usually the busiest room of the house, it has the opportunity to be the most intelligent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choices for kitchen appliances are driven by how the cookspace is used on a daily basis, what minimizes labor, and what cuts down cooking time. Take into consideration the steam oven cooking 3x faster or the dishwasher that packs more in a single cycle. Whether you are a gourmet chef or simply someone who likes good meals with minimal effort, the following features will help you to work smarter in the kitchen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Combination convection-steam oven</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to consumers’ desire for healthy meals that can be prepared in shorter-than-usual times comes the steam-assist oven. Usually combined with a convection feature, this oven circulates air for more even cooking and emits steam for juicier results with meat, chicken, and fish. Together, these functions can also reduce cooking time by as much as a third to a half, and that means a lower energy bill. This oven is great for reheating food the next day without drying it out. If you don’t want to commit to the triple-thousand-dollar price tag or switch out your present oven at the moment, there are countertop versions available from companies like Cuisinart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Induction cooktop</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not brand new to the scene, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank">induction</a> continues to innovate, ensuring its place in the working-smart kitchen appliances category. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Precision cooking</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Induction works by connecting to the size of the pan, heating only where it’s needed. This reduces energy waste from an open gas flame or an exposed electrical element that emits heat outside of its center of contact. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stay safe</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area around the cooking zone also stays relatively cool, as opposed to electric coils or the grate above a gas burner. So you don’t have to worry about an accidental burn. Look for added safety features such as automatic turnoff in the case of extreme heat or if a cooking zone operates for a particularly long time. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Save time</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some manufacturers, like Thermador, offer an induction cooktop with memory, so if you move a pan to another area of the surface, all the programmed settings will be transferred to the new location of the pan, eliminating the need to re-jigger that perfect heat adjustment. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Fridges with climate-controlled compartments </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication centers that take and send messages, and software that stores and transmits recipes are getting a lot of attention right now, but one factor remains constant: among the top complaints homeowners have for their refrigerators is food waste. Not that it’s the fridge’s fault, but the greater the capacity—and capacity is a major factor in selection—the more likely the cucumbers will get shoved to the back of the drawer, only to be discovered when they have become a slimy mess. To answer this, manufacturers have fine-tuned climate control with drawers that include dedicated convertible temperature settings so the cheese stays fresh and the lettuce crisp in their neighboring compartments. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refrigerator drawers such as those from Fisher &amp; Paykel offer subtle climate control for maximum flexibility when you toggle between the need for extra fridge or freezer space, or even to perfectly chill wine for a party.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bosch_079_rev3_PAGE_1C_jw_v12-noglow-e1495678384366.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24091 size-chrono" title="dishwasher" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bosch_079_rev3_PAGE_1C_jw_v12-noglow-723x542.jpg" alt="dishwasher" width="723" height="542" /></a>Photo: Bosch<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bosch_079_rev3_PAGE_1C_jw_v12-noglow-e1495678384366.jpg" target="_blank"><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Third-rack dishwasher</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the operation of a dishwasher is surely a science, the loading of the dishwasher is something of an art. The range of contents—dishes, pans, flatware, mixing bowls, hinged utensils—can require imagination and strategy to place them effectively for the best wash. With the addition of a third rack that can be adjusted to customize loads, many of those odd and oversized items, like sheet-cake pans and serving trays, can be cleaned at the same time as a complete load of dinner dishes, saving time, electricity, and water. Another option: twin removable trays that can be positioned to allow long-stemmed wine glasses on one side while stowing all the flatware in a rack atop the salad bowls on the other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hands-free faucet</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have two options here: a motion sensor in the shank of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-trends-kitchen-faucets/" target="_blank">faucet</a> that detects the wave of a hand to turn on the water, or a touch-sensitive version that operates with gentle pressure from the back of the wrist or elbow. The benefit is time (and water) saved in clean-up since you don’t have to wash down the handles repeatedly during the course of preparing a meal.</span></p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Take your smart kitchen one step further with a seamless, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank">integrated design</a> to keep your space clutter and chaos free.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">From ranges and dishwashers to refrigerators, here are appliances that fit small-space kitchens like a (rubber) glove</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23398 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Manhattan kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-723x485.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02" width="723" height="485" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-723x485.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-600x402.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></span><span class="img-label"> (Above) A 24&#8243; Bertazzoni range in Pallavi and Keyur&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/pallavi-keyurs-manhattan-apartment-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manhattan renovation</a></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the size of their kitchen, most homeowners feel it could be larger. But what if your kitchen is </span><span class="s1"><i> really </i></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">small? Depending on the room’s dimensions—a narrow galley kitchen or even a trim 12- by 12-foot box shape—appliances in particular can seem to overwhelm a space and throw everything out of proportion. Thankfully, manufacturers have responded to this dilemma with smaller-size appliances that still offer the function you want while not overwhelming the space. What’s more, you may find the smaller kitchen, with most everything in arm’s reach, is actually more efficient and thus a happier, more productive place to cook. And with so many major manufacturers on this bandwagon, you don’t have to sacrifice style, either. P.S.: If you have a large kitchen, this is good news, too, providing the opportunity to fit an additional cook surface or fridge, or turn a walk-in pantry into an additional prep space. Read on:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layout in a triangle</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For any kitchen to work well, the layout must be planned for top efficiency. In a small cookspace, appliances in close proximity mean fewer steps and better conservation of movement and energy. Follow the classic kitchen triangle: place the functions of cooking, cooling and washing—stove, fridge, and sink—so that if you draw a line from each one to the other, you create a triangle. This means you will have allowed some landing space next to each of these features, and separation, too, to avoid a collision if two people share the kitchen. Once your floor plan is a go, you can choose the appliances that will do the job you want—and also fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cooking with mini power</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have your heart set on a range, more than a few manufacturers will accommodate you with a compact 24-inch model that allows four burners and an oven, too, of course. <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueStar</a> makes a range in an industrial style that isn’t the size of an SVU but still packs loads of cooking power. If you’re comfortable with classic style, look for a vintage 21-inch O’Keefe and Merritt, a model created when small kitchens were the only way to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Need to go smaller still? You can find two-burner radiant and induction cooktops from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.kitchenaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KitchenAid</a> or <a href="https://www.geappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE</a> in widths starting at 15 inches. Then place the oven on the wall to free up more undercounter space for a slim dishwasher (more on this below). Also check out combo ovens that offer microwave as well as convection (one less appliance!), available from most manufacturers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t overlook range hoods; these come smaller, too, to top off their cooking cousins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21380 mb-10 size-chrono" title="small space appliances" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08-723x1085.gif" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
<span class="img-label"> (Above) An undercounter refrigerator (left of the sink) and 24&#8243; range in Emily&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upper West Side renovation</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Compact cooling </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Refrigeration of smaller stature has come a long way since the top-mount model in your starter apartment. Manufacturers such as <a href="https://www.vikingrange.com/consumer/category/products/refrigeration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking</a> make a model as slim as 30 inches, which can still stow a tray of appetizers. Need to go slimmer still? <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a>, LG, and GE each offer a stainless-steel bottom freezer refrigerator that measures 24 inches wide. If you don’t tend to stock a lot for daily meals, a refrigerator drawer (or two) is an alternative, and can be found from Thermador, <a href="https://www.monogram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE Monogram</a>, or Electrolux for as small as 24 inches wide by 34 ¼ inches high. Plus, the elimination of another swinging door helps reduce the feeling of clutter, easing traffic jams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undercounter fridges that still have a door are also available from companies such as KitchenAid, Frigidaire, Kenmore, and <a href="https://www.whirlpool.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whirlpool</a>. You can get a nice long run of counterspace if you keep all your appliances under the counter, which will make the overall space look less cluttered and hence feel larger.</span></p>
<p><strong>Washing in small batches</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The standard dishwasher comes 24 inches wide, and that will fit in most galley kitchens. But if you wish to go smaller, Frigidaire, Bosch, and Kenmore make models as narrow as 18 inches—just what you need to handle a day’s dishes. Or consider a dishwasher drawer like those from <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel</a>. Typically available at 24 inches wide, these versions can handle dishware for a party of six, but if that’s not how you dine every day, then it’s not a major issue anyway.</p>
