<h3>Keeping their Jackson Heights remodel in view<span>—for years</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">We purchased our co-op roughly three years before embarking on the renovation. Our goal was to totally revamp the apartment into open-plan spaces, while preserving its period features. Like many pre-war homes, it had a lot of small rooms. I think our result is proof that, even if there’s no perfect moment to remodel, intensive planning pays off.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Keeping historic details</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The 1,400-square-foot unit is located in a 1921 historical-district co-op in Jackson Heights, Queens. The place hadn’t been touched since the 1970s and was in rough shape. But there were nice original details, like beautiful wood floors with inlaid borders and a period fireplace. It needed a significant overhaul.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Dia and I didn’t rush it. We’d rented in the neighborhood for a couple of years to make sure we liked the area—and we did. After finding the co-op, we wanted to take our time and put our stamp on it. We spent almost two years planning the remodel. By the time we were ready to proceed, Dia was pregnant with our daughter, Madeleine. We were eager to get the job done, and ready to pick up the pace. </span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">In-depth research and planning </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/50730" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project</a> on Sweeten. We made clear in our overview that we were ready to obtain our co-op board approvals, navigate the permitting, order materials, and get started. By then we’d spent a lot of time planning the layout, materials, and finishes. We had 40 pages of diagrams, renderings, and materials lists. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Five or six Sweeten contractors came for site visits and gave us estimates. Right away, one stood out. He had printed out our mammoth set of plans (which he jokingly referred to as “the bible”), came armed with excellent questions, spoke knowledgeably about what would and would not be possible given NYC building codes, and gave us a detailed and reasonable estimate. We knew immediately that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we wanted to hire him</a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">A gut remodel with an extensive to-do list </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Going in, we made sure the contractor understood that we had a specific vision, and that we were demanding. We planned to open the kitchen, living, and dining rooms, build a modern kitchen, renovate both bathrooms to spa standards, and add closet space. At the same time, we intended to keep original details, and even increase them by adding period chandeliers and other fixtures that would complement the co-op’s 1920s style.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07.jpg" alt="Dark blue built-in cabinets and shelving with white counter" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52013" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Kitchen-Closet-01.gif" alt="Built-in kitchen closet storage with doors opening and closing" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52006" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Our renovation scope was specific. It included replacing and relocating the breaker box, and installing new switches and sockets. We wanted to remove several unnecessary walls, and rebuild two walls and two water-damaged window encasements. We requested new baseboards and crown moldings. In the kitchen, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned to add a peninsula</a>, a custom pantry, and a sideboard. We wanted to build closets in the bedrooms and entryway, as well as custom cabinets and radiator covers. We’d paint every room and refinish the floors.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Problem solving with the general contractor team</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Several miracles occurred in the kitchen. When we removed a wall to make way for the new peninsula, it resulted in a break in the floor inlay, but the floor subcontractor recreated the </span><span class="s2">multi-wood pattern so skillfully that you can’t tell what is original and what is new. Our appliance vendor’s repeated delivery delays caused a need for our countertops to be installed before the appliances. Our Sweeten contractor got them in when they arrived, despite incredible difficulty—installing our refrigerator even required removing the baseboard temporarily.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2">When our single-piece sideboard countertop was too big for the elevator, the guys carried them up five flights of stairs. And when the new electrical box occupied the former microwave place, the cabinetmaker came up with a built-in pantry, designed with an interior cutout to fit the oven.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In our bathroom, we had other inspired solutions. We wanted to move the toilet but a steel beam prevented placement in the new rough-in location. Our contractor proposed a wall-hung toilet that freed up space for it to stay in the original location and squeezed in a vanity, which wasn’t possible with the traditional commode. Thanks to supply-chain disruptions during Covid-19, we ended up sourcing bathroom tile other than that from our original wishlist—and the manufacturer offered no coordinating trim. Our general contractor found a trim that matched and drove more than 700 miles to collect every piece they could find.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Homeowners share their renovation advice</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">As first-time renovators, our biggest questions from the beginning were about how to manage the many subcontractors and aspects of the work happening simultaneously. But our Sweeten contractor pulled it all together. Our initial instincts about planning carefully were validated, but the process also taught us to always have a Plan B. We certainly learned the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweeten-renovator-reviews-10-things-they-loved-about-their-general-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">value of picking the right contractor</a>—one who inspires confidence and keeps your best interests at heart.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2">We couldn’t have asked for a more professional and dedicated team. At the start, he helped us gather the necessary co-op board sign-offs and connected us with an architect. He managed the permitting process seamlessly, despite NYC Department of Buildings changes during Covid-19. At every step, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our general contractor</a> went above and beyond to help us realize our vision.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">I’m not sure anyone comes in under budget in a renovation. We didn’t, but we stayed </span><span class="s2">roughly in line with our expectations. There was a payoff, in any case. Our beautiful result! Even having done the project six months after having our baby and during a pandemic, we feel peaceful. We are in love with our home.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Homeowners:</strong> A young couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27287#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their Bed-Stuy remodel</a> on Sweeten to revitalize their townhouse</li>
<li><strong>Where:</strong> Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> Outfit their 1,500-square-foot Bed-Stuy home with a new kitchen, bath, and open-concept living area</li>
<li><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4715#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Sweeten&#8217;s role:</strong> <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reimagining the Bed-Stuy home for family life</h3>
<p>This Bedford-Stuyvesant home once belonged to the homeowner&#8217;s grandmother. The home came with fond memories of her childhood, so she happily inherited it. However, as the townhouse had been built in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, it needed a lot of work. She would remodel it to accommodate the needs of her own family. They planned for an open concept layout, with open sightlines to keep the family together while in different rooms. To modernize the spaces, they&#8217;d outfit their dream kitchen and bathroom with new, state-of-the-art appliances and finishes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2.jpg" alt="Exterior of the Bed-Stuy home with front yard and metal gate" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52273" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>She turned to Sweeten to find a contractor she&#8217;d be comfortable with handling this important renovation. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27287#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4715#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found the right contractor</a> with experience in old-home remodels. They signed the contract and the work began!</p>
<h3>Necessary behind-the-wall updates</h3>
<p>First, fixing the systems behind the walls had to be done to support updated materials and appliances. The plumbing had corroded and was located in inefficient places. The electrical also needed to be upgraded. Their Sweeten contractor found improperly connected wires in the ceiling, which posed a fire hazard. The subfloor had to be ripped out, and the joists had to be reinforced to keep the kitchen floor from collapsing.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="white-and-gray-kitchen-cabinet-with-island" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-07.jpg" alt="White and gray kitchen cabinets with kitchen island after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-51527 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>All this work made the kitchen functional and safe. The design aesthetic came next. The homeowner chose a contemporary combination of white cabinets along the kitchen perimeter, and gray base cabinets for the island. The owners selected quartz countertops for the work surface, due to their <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/popular-types-of-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reasonable price point and durability</a>. The island became the focal point of the room, which also featured deliberate pops of color, like the must-have bright red range. Other features, such as a gold-finish pot filler, pull-out storage cabinets, and a built-in wine rack, completed the look.</p>
<h3>New layout and features</h3>
<p>The rest of the Bed-Stuy home benefited from the remodel, too. Their contractor removed a wall between the kitchen and living area to open up the flow. They also installed new wood floors, along with all-new recessed lights, a closet, and a front door. Another addition: a new laundry room, which replaced an existing screened-in porch area. The contractor fully outfitted the laundry room—from reconstructing electrical, plumbing, and insulation to subflooring and venting.</p>

<h3>Rejuvenating the master bathroom</h3>
<p>Like the kitchen, the master bathroom would become her dream bathroom. As a mom, it would be her sanctuary. A standalone tub would give her the chance to unwind. The construction crew faced a challenge: nestling the tub into a tight niche without damaging or touching the walls. But the crew completed the task handily, with the result being an inviting clawfoot oasis, flanked on one end by a custom vanity. In a nod to wainscoting, the team <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-much-does-it-cost-to-tile-a-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installed the bathroom tile</a> halfway up the wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-floating-vanity-and-bathtub" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-16.jpg" alt="White bathroom with floating vanity and bathtub after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-51534 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Working with the right contractor</h3>
<p>For this nostalgic renovation, the homeowner saw and worked with her Sweeten contractor for months. Fortunately, she found the right partner who understood her vision. This partnership allowed them to communicate throughout the process and solve problems when issues arose. A solid working bond between the client and Sweeten contractor formed, so much so, when it looked like their renovation would not be done in time for Thanksgiving, their contractor invited them to celebrate with his family. Luckily, their new home is now ready to create brand new memories for years to come.</p>

<p>Homeowners have a personal style that they express through their designs. Kitchen cabinetry uses a good percentage of an overall renovation budget. So, how do you stay true to your design aesthetic without breaking the bank? One way is to opt for the look of custom cabinets without actually ordering custom. That&#8217;s where Semihandmade kitchen cabinets come in!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.semihandmade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semihandmade</a> makes doors specifically for standard Ikea kitchen cabinets, bathrooms, media, and storage units. Here, we round up some top <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> renovations which used these doors transforming a wow-level on an affordable budget.

<p>(<em>Above</em>) Tina + Andrew&#8217;s kitchen</p>
<p>Tina loved her charming 1930s prewar building she grew up in. So when a two-bedroom co-op became available, she and her husband, Andrew, jumped at the chance. It <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">needed to be renovated</a> but that didn&#8217;t stop them. They posted their project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and hired a general contractor to update their kitchen.</p>
<p>The couple needed to stay on budget, so they looked into Semihandmade cabinet doors. <span style="color: #333333;">&#8220;W<span style="font-weight: 400;">e tried to be clever and save where we could,&#8221; says Tina. &#8220;Instead of custom cabinets, we went with Ikea but purchased the cabinet doors from a company that specializes in stylish and modern cabinetry for Ikea kitchen systems.”  They chose a beautiful super matte shaker cabinet in white and light gray. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tip from Beth</strong>: Semihandmade doors are simple to screw on and off, so if down the road you want a totally different look, you can easily change out the doors instead of tearing out your kitchen all over again!</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) A Queens kitchen in a rich neutral</span></p>
<p>Like many homeowners who renovate, this couple&#8217;s biggest concern was budget. After renting for years, they had saved up to buy their own place, a two-bedroom, two-bath in Flushing. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-flushing-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decided updating the kitchen</a> would be the most dramatic change. They chose a mix of neutrals and opted for Semihandmade cabinet doors with Ikea bases. This allowed the couple to get a customized look for a fraction of what fully custom cabinets cost. <span style="font-weight: 400;">“The space is much more open and inviting,&#8221; says one of the homeowners. &#8220;I’ve never been one to hang out in the kitchen, but now I want to spend more time here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Tip from Beth</strong>: <span style="color: #333333;">Semihandmade doors come in 45 different colors and styles, but the doors are also available unpainted so you can unleash your DIY spirit.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Dan + Mike&#8217;s kitchen open shelving storage</span></p>
<p>Dan and Mike&#8217;s one-bedroom, one-bath co-op was in desperate <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">need of a kitchen renovation</a>. To achieve their desired aesthetic, it would require removing a wall, gutting the entire kitchen, and extending the counters and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cabinetry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Removing the wall had a major impact on the look as did taking down the upper cabinets and replacing them with open floating shelves. The shelves were sourced from a shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, that specializes in salvage pieces. For the lower cabinets, they installed Ikea cabinets with <a href="https://www.semihandmade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semihandmade</a> doors and hardware. Floating shelves can make up for storage lost in the removal of upper cabinets.</p>
<p><strong>Tip from Beth</strong>: Lower shelves are perfect for easy-to-grab cooking essentials like cutting boards, spices, and cookbooks. <span style="color: #333333;">Higher shelves tend to be more decorative. It’s the mix of objects and textures that makes floating shelves a standout in any kitchen.</span></p>

<h3>Finding savings to splurge</h3>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Jennifer + Alex&#8217;s two-toned kitchen</span></p>
<p>When Jennifer and Alex Figueroa bought their beach house in East Hampton, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/for-an-east-hampton-beach-house-a-simple-plan-to-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they wanted to renovate it</a> in order to meet their family&#8217;s needs. They have two young boys, so they wanted a space where they could run and play freely. This meant opening up the choppy layout and gutting the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;W<span style="font-weight: 400;">e felt excited about this part of the project,&#8221; says Alex. &#8220;We splurged on a wine fridge, quartz countertops, and an integrated refrigerator but otherwise kept the open kitchen fairly simple.&#8221; This &#8220;fairly simple&#8221; design included their contractor customizing Ikea cabinets with walnut panel doors for a two-toned look. He also added paneling on the ceiling for a luxe look. This took the 1970s home into the new millennium. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tip from Beth</strong>: Two-toned looks work well when complementary styles and colors are used for the upper and lower cabinets. Another popular trend right now is a pop of color for the kitchen island, paired with base cabinets that are more neutral.  </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Marc + Steve&#8217;s kitchen</span></p>
<p>After seven months of living in their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-white-kitchen-sized-just-right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new home,</a> Marc and Steve decided it was time to take the plunge and renovate. &#8220;The kitchen <span style="font-weight: 400;">was perhaps the most outdated room,&#8221; says Marc. The existing cabinets were grimy and the doors were falling off the hinges. They wouldn&#8217;t be able to measure for new cabinets before work began. Marc and Steve decided to use Ikea cabinets with Semihandmade doors in order to get the cabinets quicker (custom cabinets have longer lead times.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To streamline the look of the kitchen, they chose flat-panel doors rather than the popular shaker style. They needed to order cabinets of varying sizes so this choice helped to unify the space. </span>“Design-wise, it’s the kitchen we always wanted and I don’t think we have any regrets about the choices we made (and there were so many choices),&#8221; said Marc.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tip from Beth</strong>: Since we make our door fronts to order, the time it takes from payment to delivery depends on the materials purchased. C<span style="color: #333333;">urrently, the average lead time is 3-6 weeks.</span></span></p>

<h3>A charming (but not functional) Colonial house</h3>
<p>We had been dividing our time between a farmhouse in Dutchess County and a walk-up apartment in Brooklyn. When our son was born, neither of these homes was quite suited to us. We decided to find a place in between with a shorter commute for my husband, more social opportunities for me, and easy access to the home.</p>

<p>When we first saw the house, we were charmed by the time-capsule of a kitchen—salmon Formica, dark-wood cabinets, and a dishwasher that predated the other elements. That said, we knew we would eventually update the kitchen. Having a lavatory on the ground floor and not having to run upstairs was also on the wishlist.</p>

<h3>Their Colonial renovation adds heated floors</h3>
<p>The existing kitchen had one radiator, which was buried in the back of a custom cabinet. It was a clever solution at the time, but ate up a lot of cabinet space and wasn’t heat-efficient. We decided to install a radiant floor heating system that we could run off of our existing hot-water heating system. A more formal, fully-functional <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island would offer storage</a>, outlets, and a bigger counter area.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wanted to create a better flow of traffic and light. The main entrance to the kitchen from the dining room was a narrow 28-inch-wide doorway. It made the kitchen feel isolated from the rest of the house. Bringing down the wall would not have respected the house’s character. Instead, the opening was widened and centered between the two rooms to bring more natural light into the north-facing kitchen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18.jpg" alt="Bertazzoni stove" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45106" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p>Some infrastructural elements dictated a lot of the design. One was that the major waste line for the three upstairs bathrooms lays along the kitchen’s exterior wall. It had been boxed out previously, and the existing cabinets had been customized around it. We didn’t want to relocate that line, so we decided to figure out how to incorporate it.</p>
<p>The second element was a sheetrock box beam of sorts. We didn’t know what was in it, but since it was asymmetrically placed and not detailed like the house’s other box beams, we assumed it was hiding something expensive to move. Our thought was, let’s give this weird beam and column matching mates to create symmetry.</p>
<h3>Odd-ball elements</h3>
<p>These design decisions hid the two odd-ball elements by making it look like they’d always been there. Bonus: We made that second column a sneaky little cabinet right between the sink/dishwasher and our espresso machine. It’s the perfect spot for drinking glasses and cups. We love it!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48250" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p>I wanted to bring the warmth and softness of natural wood into the kitchen, so I chose a darker wood for the cabinets that echoes our furniture. A built-in pantry was replaced with custom open shelving. The adjustable shelves look like they might have been there when the house was built. It enhances the room’s original feel and provides a display for our brown-drip dishware collection.</p>
<h3>Turning closets into a powder room</h3>
<p>There was <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-renovations-that-added-another-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no bathroom on the first floor</a>. We combined two closets—approximately 4’ x 4’—and some square footage where we used to hang coats by the back door. The sacrifice was worth it for what would become the most frequented bathroom in the house. A pocket door with frosted glass saved space and allowed light to flow through. We installed Art Deco wallpaper, wainscoting, a picture rail, and paint in neutral tones.</p>
<p>Though manufacturers say that you can install wood flooring over radiant heat systems, it made me leery, and wood is not an efficient conductor of heat. I was certain I wanted tile, but one that wouldn&#8217;t appear cold or hard.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The right contractor for our Colonial house renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten helped us find a group of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried-and-true general contractors</a> to vet. In the past, we’d tried a few recommended by neighbors, but this time that didn’t work. And this project was too big an investment to just pick somebody out of a hat. It was great to be able to talk through everything with a Sweeten professional and get a curated list. I doubt we&#8217;d have found our contractor on our own, and I&#8217;m so glad we did.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were much more organized than contractors we&#8217;d worked with previously. Our contractor seemed to have experience and know-how beyond his years. When we ran into uncertainties, he was great at suggesting possible solutions. There was a structural issue discovered during demolition that required changes to the design layout. He was quick to help us with potential resolutions, down to providing revised elevations so we could visualize the new design. And he always discussed costs with us before we signed off. They also provided spreadsheets to help me keep track of all the elements I needed to order and have on-site.</span></p>

<h3>Veteran renovators share advice</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with our renovation was waiting for it to be finished! Time moves slowly when you&#8217;re living on the second floor of your home, feeding a family from a makeshift kitchen in your bedroom. This was no fault of our contractors. Our city building department took three months to issue our permits.</p>
<p>If you can, live with your space for a while before renovating. You&#8217;ll end up with a much clearer picture of how to make your new space work best for you.</p>
<p>Also, always budget for 10-20% more than your original estimate, especially for kitchens and baths in old houses. This is our fourth renovation experience, and there has always been a major structural or plumbing issue (or both!) that have come up. It’s never pleasant, but if you plan for it, it&#8217;s way less painful.</p>
<p>Our new space makes us feel happy! We really love all of the new millwork in the home remodel, it feels so harmonious with the rest of our beautiful old Colonial home.</p>

They found a good fit in a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2,030-square-foot brick house</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Brooklyn. However, like most homes built in the early 1900s, it needed work. They found a Sweeten contractor to transform their three-story home, starting with the kitchen. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The existing kitchen was an L-shape with very little counter space; not ideal for a family who loves to cook. The main components of the kitchen—dishwasher, wall oven, sink—shifted to one wall. This created enough space for an island and wrap-around pantry with full wall kitchen cabinet doors. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s amazing how much the wrap-around pantry holds,” explains Nadia. It acts as the other main kitchen wall. It can only fit cabinets up to 15 inches deep so they decided to install full-height, 15-inch upper cabinets. This allowed them to store copious amounts of pantry items and serving ware. </span></p><h3><b>Modern kitchen idea</b><b>: </b>Relocating the fridge</h3><p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="tall white kitchen cabinets built in storage" width="1000" height="1496" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44861" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-06-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-06-600x898.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="white kitchen built in storage" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44862" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally and Ross waited five years to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/integrated-white-kitchen-jackson-heights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fix up their two-bedroom apartment i</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">n Jackson Heights, Queens. They wanted to live in it for a while in order to make the best renovation plan. The couple was tired of trading off who got to cook in the kitchen. Two people couldn’t fit in the kitchen at once and the layout wasn’t functional. When the dishwasher was open, it blocked the fridge. Plus, storage was lacking. Sally had to get down on her hands and knees to search with a flashlight to find what was hiding in the lower cabinets.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With their <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a>&#8216;s help, they devised a plan to increase the functionality of the space, leaving their galley kitchen partially open to the living area. “I found myself gravitating toward kitchens that banked all the tall pantries with the fridges to one side,” says Sally. So, they moved the refrigerator outside the main cooking area, flanking it with tall pantries and kitchen wall cabinets. Inside they “hid” cleaning supplies as well as other everyday essentials.</span></p><h3><b>Modern style</b><b>: </b>A streamlined and clean effect</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44863 size-full mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-David-Apt-06.jpg" alt="grey full wall kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-David-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-David-Apt-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-David-Apt-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one homeowner in Manhattan, his </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-cool-and-contemporary-kitchen-redo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">compact 860-square-foot apartment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> left much to be desired. The kitchen had a small sink in a strange location and the stove and refrigerator were right next to each other. Aesthetically, it needed work as well. The pine cabinets were outdated as were the flooring and countertops. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They found a contractor who specialized in r</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">enovating small spaces.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The main objective was to remove the dividing wall between the kitchen and family room to make the space feel larger and more modern. However, storage was also a priority. They replaced the dividing wall with a custom cabinet unit that had storage on both sides. On the kitchen side, it houses an integrated refrigerator and on the other side, pantry items. This was a nice compromise.</span></p><h3><b>Modern layout</b><b>: </b>An entry wall of tall kitchen cabinets</h3><p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-04.jpg" alt="entry with tall cabinet builts in hiding refrigerator" width="1000" height="1498" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37555" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joseph, an immigration lawyer and painter, and Sunghee, a curator, rented their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clinton Hills co-op </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Brooklyn for several years before buying it. The couple wanted it to reflect their Japanese sensibility now that it was all their own.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help, they found a general contractor who was able to fulfill the couple’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/44-square-foot-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovation scope</a>: increase the storage space within their 44-square-foot kitchen. The key to the solution was moving the refrigerator out of the kitchen and into the foyer just outside the kitchen. Their architect designed a wall of book-matched white oak cabinets in the foyer. One cabinet stored shoes, a vacuum, and microwave; another concealed the refrigerator; while a double cabinet had a modular shelving unit. All in all, the couple was able to maximize their small space to its fullest potential. </span></p><h3><b>Modern materials</b><b>: </b><span class="s1">Mixed-media for texture and depth</span></h3><p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-9.jpg" alt="wooden_kitchen_cabinets_with_concrete_peninsula" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44936" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Kitchen-9-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Designer Matthew Stewart’s new home purchase was a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/renovation-materials-shine-in-designers-full-home-reno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fixer-upper</a>.

He received several high estimates but it was his Sweeten contractor who convinced him he could complete the remodel within his budget.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Matthew’s kitchen would be a simple design using mixed media: wood and laminate with the countertops in concrete. The materials were layered at different depths bringing volume to the kitchen.

Tara and Brian asked their contractor to modernize their space, rework the clunky layout, add a kitchen island—and do it all before the baby was born.</span></p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44867 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-Apt-11.gif" alt="concealed tile full wall cabinets" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contractor suggested a good workaround for the refrigerator. The solution was to conceal the refrigerator in existing closets directly across from the main kitchen. They matched those closets to the other cabinets in the kitchen for a cohesive look. In addition, there was wall space that wasn’t serving a purpose. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To fix this, the couple’s contractor turned it into a small pantry in keeping with the “concealed” theme of the kitchen design. (When shut, it looks like a tiled wall but when open, a 10-inch deep cabinet is revealed.)</span></p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44868 size-full mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-0158-scaled.jpg" alt="white lacquer full wall kitchen cabinets" width="2560" height="1707" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-0158-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-0158-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-0158-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa and Russ loved their new </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/good-design-elevates-park-slope-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two-bedroom co-op</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a historic brownstone in Park Slope, Brooklyn, but like many properties in the area, it needed updating. They wanted to keep their kitchen separate from the rest of the living area. So they turned to designers Casey and Kumar—and a Sweeten contractor—for help. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make the kitchen feel separate, Casey and Kumar suggested building a partial wall. To carve out more storage space, they added a </span>full wall of kitchen pantry <span style="font-weight: 400;">cabinets in white lacquer. Not only were they able to conceal a washer/dryer combo, but also a refrigerator. In addition, their Sweeten contractor built a custom pantry pull-out in the narrow space between these two appliances.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A renovation gives a design-obsessed owner the ultimate pad</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>For a lot of singles in New York City, a 500-square-foot Greenwich Village studio with both a lofted bedroom and an outdoor balcony would sound like a pie-in-the-sky find. But new homeowner Carly Schulte had a higher vision for this downtown co-op—she knew when she saw it that she could improve on it. She snapped up the apartment and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/26202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors. Here’s how Carly literally raised the lofty studio’s roof, with a Sweeten general contractor, making it a party-friendly place that feels larger than it really is.</i></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Carly</i></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I was lucky in the apartment hunt. I’d only been to a handful of showings, but when I saw this place, I knew I wanted to make an offer. I have a soft spot for lofts, and the balcony made it a must-have. I’d been <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planning—and saving—to buy</a> an apartment for years, and it was a good thing I waited. The sellers were motivated. I put in a bid and pulled off the purchase.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I’d envisioned an overhaul that included renovating the kitchen and bathroom, modernizing the loft and stairs, and adding a giant wall-to-wall built-in of shelves and closets in the living room,</span><span class="s1"> but it was once I was there that I clarified my goals. I realized I wanted to expand the kitchen, since I love to cook; I needed a larger kitchen peninsula that would serve as both a work and eating surface. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="carly-against-black-accent-wall"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43379" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Carly-portrait-1.jpg" alt="photo of carly standing in front of a black accent wall after renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Carly-portrait-1.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Carly-portrait-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Carly-portrait-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Although I left things like cabinet dimensions and stair specs to the professionals, I selected all the flooring, cabinets, [and other finishes].</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It dawned on me, too, that I wanted to raise the ceiling. One of the apartment’s previous owners had actually <i>dropped</i> it by at least five feet, wasting space and blocking light. In my mind, high ceilings are pretty much universally beloved and will definitely add value when I ultimately go to sell the apartment. I saw that by reclaiming the height, I could enclose the sleeping loft, allowing it to feel private but still be bright. I designed the windowed loft wall by looking through Instagram and showing the drawings to my Sweeten contractor. He found a way to make the enclosure with sliding glass panels that transmit both air and light.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I knew when I hired my contractor that I wanted to work this way, doing my own design work, and I was happy to find a contractor who would work with me. To say I was hands-on would be an understatement. Although I left cabinet and stair specs to the professionals, I handled most of the materials including the cabinets, tile, and appliances, as well as the layouts for each room (which was surprisingly time-consuming). </span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">When it came to aesthetics, I stayed neutral, particularly in more permanent elements like flooring and cabinetry. But I have a huge interest in texture, and I was excited about mixing flat, modern, cool elements, such as the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/stairs-that-are-a-real-design-treat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">steel staircase</a> and black cabinetry [a <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/home/photo-gallery/45662050/image/45662053/Deep-Dark">great way to create depth</a>], with warmer ones, like the wood-grain floors and golden-brown leather and upholstery. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To achieve the look I wanted, we had to do the work. It was a challenge, with bumps. The worst came early, when we demolished the kitchen and found asbestos. Remediation cost about $6,000 and added three months to the timeline. I would strongly recommend asbestos testing during the diligence phase to any potential buyer. Had I tested up-front and knocked some of the abatement costs off of the purchase price, I would have saved money.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">From start to finish, excluding the asbestos work, my renovation spanned five months. I moved out for several weeks when the contractor knocked down walls and raised the ceiling. For much of it, though, I was there. I had no kitchen for six months and lived out of suitcases and boxes. Luckily, my bedroom remained mostly untouched, so once the enclosure was finished, I spent my home time up there. I don’t regret slumming it. The money I saved on short-term housing enabled me to buy the gas stove of my dreams!</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I heavily underestimated how long the approval process would take. The time it took just to obtain the co-op board’s approval for my plan was nearly six months. Staying in my rental apartment in hopes of a fast renovation was a big mistake. If I had it to do again, I would move in right after closing, live in my new space, and use that rent money for something meaningful. Hindsight is 20/20!</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">People have asked how I lived through the project. I think I blocked some of it out, but I do remember leaning on the Sweeten team after a few long construction delays made me feel frustrated and uncertain. They offered me a sounding board and helped me adjust my expectations, and as a first-time renovator struggling to parse out the delays, their guidance was immensely helpful. When needed, Sweeten contacted my contractor and helped to keep things moving smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Despite the difficulties, I love the way the place turned out. The raised ceiling, now about 16 feet high, changed the entire feel of the place. The library ladder, a functional addition facilitating access to the high cupboards, added a fun touch, and the loft enclosure made the bedroom feel cozy and intimate. My new kitchen has made cooking every meal a pleasure, and even the bathroom is beautiful, which is rare to say about a bathroom. There was stress and sweat, sure. But designing the space was one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever worked on.</span></p>

<p>When shopping for cabinets, your lifestyle, plus the materials available, will guide and influence the appearance of your cabinet doors. Do you like the traditional Shaker-style door with its raised frame and crisp edges? Or a sleek flat-front contemporary panel? Are your kids opening and closing doors all day with sticky fingers? Or is your kitchen the entertaining hub of your home, one that you like to keep looking neat for visiting friends and family?</p>
<p>Just about any style of door panel you choose will offer a range of finishes, many of them protective. Here,<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, lays out how to choose the right kitchen cabinets.</p>
<h3>How to choose your cabinet door style</h3>
<p>Most commonly, the door is a flat panel, a raised panel, or a slab front. What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>A raised panel</strong> has a raised rectangular-shaped center and the surface surrounding it is recessed, creating a frame-like appearance. The raised center may be surrounded by other detailing, such as a beveled edge, and/or an arched top, providing a traditional appearance, like antique cabinetry. This style looks beautiful with painted or stained finishes that play up the three-dimensional qualities.</p>

<p><strong>A flat panel</strong> is three-dimensional as well, but the center panel is recessed (though still flat) and framed by two stiles (rectilinear panels at either side) and two rails (panels at top and bottom). This construction is not simply decorative. It was developed (hundreds of years ago!) to keep the door shape stable with fluctuating temperatures and moisture. Popular examples are Shaker and Craftsman style. You can also find some additional variation, with a glass insert that replaces some or all of the center panel (much like a true divided light window), or a beadboard center panel for a country or cottage effect.</p>

<p><strong>A slab front</strong> is made from a single piece of material—solid hardwood, MDF, or a wood veneer. Because it is one surface with no corners or recesses to capture grime, it is easy to keep clean with the swipe of a cloth.</p>

<h3>Cabinet door materials</h3>
<p>Are you warm to wood or is a sparkling white kitchen more your craving? You can find a vast variety of looks in budget, high-end, and luxury cabinets. The rarer the material—think, solid wood—the greater the price tag. Here’s a quick guide to materials from lowest to highest price:</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30487 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above) </em>Custom cabinets with a walnut and mahogany veneer and inset doors in</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-studio-co-op-renovated-for-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Kim and Ian’s kitchen</a></p>
<p><strong>MDF or medium density fiberboard</strong> is manufactured under high pressure and temperatures by combining wood fibers with a resin binder to create door panels as well as the cabinet box. Because this type of material can be manufactured efficiently from wood byproducts, it’s typically the material for stock cabinets. It takes well to paint. Manufacturers will offer different glaze options to apply on top of the paint, so you can still achieve a custom look for a stock price.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36580 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above) </em>Ikea cabinet bases with Semihandmade doors in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/charm-queens-row-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monique&#8217;s kitchen</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Thermafoil is a scratch-resistant surface that is thermally glued and vacuum-sealed to MDF. It’s an option in the stock category and great for a lifestyle where the kitchen sees a tremendous amount of activity since it’s easy to maintain. Color choice is limited to white or linen.</li>
<li>Laminate is common in countertops. With laminate cabinets, it’s still a resin-saturated printed paper (commonly a high-res photographic representation of wood) fused to a particleboard or MDF core to create the panel. This offering is available in the stock category.</li>
<li>Veneer cabinets have real wood door panels for less than the price of solid wood. The wood surface here is less than a quarter of an inch and wrapped around an MDF panel for stability—good for areas with high humidity. The risk here is that if the wood is chipped or dinged, you will see the synthetic core, and it can’t be satisfactorily repaired; however, if your cabinets don’t see a lot of hard use, this is a well-priced option in the stock category.</li>
<li>Solid wood is the high-end or luxury category for cabinet doors. Each panel is unique, like the tree it was milled from. The big decision here is what species of wood. The most common are oak, maple, hickory, and cherry. All are hardwoods with a natural beauty and all take stain or paint well. Woods that are prized for their natural color and grain, particularly hickory and cherry, shouldn’t be painted.</li>
<li>Maple is a very hard wood, with a finer grain than oak, so it’s a good choice if you want a perfectly smooth finish for paint and/or glaze. With a clear finish, it takes a contemporary look, and with a deeper stain, it becomes more traditional.</li>
<li>Birch and ash are also durable hardwoods good for kitchen cabinets with more pronounced grains. You may remember pine from your grandma’s days. You can still find this classic, and its knotty grain has a rustic appeal, but as one of the softest woods, it will dent more readily than other species.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation of door styles</h3>
<p>The style of your kitchen cabinetry doesn’t stop with the door design. How the door lays on the box also affects the overall appearance; it’s another decision you will have to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full overlay: Doors (and drawers) cover the front of the cabinet box; hinges are hidden.</li>
<li>Partial overlay: Doors cover just a portion of the face frame; hinges remain concealed.</li>
<li>Inset: Doors are flush with the face frame of the cabinet box; hinges may be concealed or exposed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are the types of kitchen cabinets?</h3>
<p>Your selection process will begin with the door material, as it takes the brunt of the action, swinging open and shut all day, every day. Cabinet doors attach as a cover to the storage compartment they serve to conceal—typically, a box made of wood, plywood, or a wood composite. Construction offered by manufacturers, along with price, is defined by three categories:</p>
<h4>Stock cabinets</h4>
<ul>
<li>$60/ linear foot</li>
<li>Door material: MDF (covered in thermafoil, veneer, or laminate)</li>
<li>Box material: MDF</li>
</ul>
<p>Doors and their boxes come in a limited range of standard sizes. Boxes and doors tend to be made of MDF (medium density fiberboard, which is a composite of sawdust or wood fibers with resin to bind it) and covered in thermafoil, veneer, or laminate. Available from large retailers like Home Depot or Ikea, these cabinets can be good quality but are also the thriftiest choice. Prices vary across the country, starting at about $60 per linear foot and rising to a few hundred dollars, depending on any features you add. Most major manufacturers have a stock line. You may think that there are no options for customization in this category but some brands do offer upgrades such as glass doors or a selection of molding.</p>
<h4>Semi-custom cabinets</h4>
<ul>
<li>$90/ linear foot and up</li>
<li>Door material: solid wood</li>
<li>Box material: MDF or plywood</li>
</ul>
<p>A greater range of sizes and styles according to the manufacturer’s offering. Boxes may be constructed of MDF or plywood. Solid wood doors should be part of the selection, along with MDF and veneers. Expect to pay $90 per linear foot and upward, depending on what organization features or finishes you add on. Find this category at some home centers as well as independent kitchen showrooms that carry national brands offering both semi-custom and custom, such as Wellborn or KraftMaid.</p>
<h4>Custom cabinets</h4>
<ul>
<li>$200 &#8211; $500/ linear foot</li>
<li>Door material: solid wood</li>
<li>Box material: higher quality plywood</li>
</ul>
<p>Built to order to exact size specifications. Boxes tend to be higher-quality plywood and doors are solid wood in a range of species. You may be able to find custom cabinets for under $200 per linear foot, but since everything is made to order to your exact dimensions (and will take longer to arrive at your doorstep, as much as three months, compared to five to six weeks for stock or semi-custom), the price rises considerably. You may pay as much $500 per linear foot and into the thousands for special woods and exterior details. Custom cabinetry is also available from national retailers, such as<a href="https://www.poggenpohl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Poggenpohl</a>,<a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Bilotta</a>, and<a href="https://henrybuilt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Henrybuilt</a>.</p>
<p>As you survey the landscape of kitchen door panels for your cabinets, be sure to ask for samples. You may even be able to borrow a door panel from a local showroom. As with any investment for your home, you will want to try it out before you commit. Hopefully, this Sweeten guide helps you choose the perfect cabinets best suited for your needs and style.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Custom kitchen islands are design puzzle pieces that&#8217;ll help meet your kitchen&#8217;s needs</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It could be the convenient location, often the center of the kitchen, or how inviting it looks—a perfect spot to sit down with a cup of coffee and newspaper, or glass of wine. When family and friends come together, it’s a place to collaborate, prep dishes, and socialize. And so it makes sense to design the kitchen island as functional, versatile, and personalized as possible. Depending on how you want to use your space, it can provide storage—think, one large <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinet</a>—a work surface, or serve as a transition between two living areas. Below, we explore 5 custom kitchen islands designed for Sweeten homeowners.</p>
<h3>A kitchen island with waterfall counter</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24402 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/becky-kitchen-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becky and Sarah’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kitchen island and waterfall counter</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a small kitchen, you might think that you don’t have enough room for a kitchen island. Sarah wasn’t sure her space could pull it off. Thankfully, her Sweeten contractor thought otherwise and came up with a design that suited the space. With pull-out drawers on one side, and custom walnut paneling from Semihandmade on the other, which faces the dining area. Topped with a beautiful white waterfall counter, it not only adds storage but becomes the focal point of the kitchen. This extra storage allowed Becky and Sarah to be more adventurous with another <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinet</a> decision: skipping the upper line entirely for open shelving.</span></p>
<h3>A half-height wall-turned-island</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24403 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01-723x496.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="723" height="496" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/before-after-kaija-and-johns-prospect-heights-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaija and John’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wall-turned-kitchen-island</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When there’s a wall separating the cookspace from the rest of your living area, you have a few options. You can keep the wall, introduce a cut-out to join it to the rest of the space, or take the wall down. There’s also a fourth option: cut the wall in half and add a countertop. That’s what the previous owner did, and although the first draft of the kitchen island didn’t meet their standards, Kaija and John realized that a true island would benefit existing storage, prep, and dining options. A new, custom-built island with deep drawers and a poured concrete countertop transformed the look and feel of the kitchen.</span></p>
<h3>A dining table so chic, you won&#8217;t notice it&#8217;s an island</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24404 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/john-and-katharines-sweetened-manhattan-apartment-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John and Katharine’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kitchen island, which doubles as a dining table</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have a kitchen joined with your living room, it can be difficult to make the spaces work as one without making sacrifices. Instead of swapping out a kitchen island for a dining table, or vice versa, John and Katharine wanted a central island in their kitchen to function as both a work space and a place to eat. They also needed a spot to hide their microwave. After discovering that Wolf makes a unit that opens up like a drawer and can be loaded from the top, rather than the front, the microwave found a home in the island. An overlapping countertop in blue-green soapstone stands out as a beautiful centerpiece, maximizing prep space while allowing the couple to dine comfortably.</p>
<h3>A moveable kitchen island (on wheels!)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_ClaireKitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24406 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_ClaireKitchen-04-723x495.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="723" height="495" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/claire-mikes-park-slope-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claire and Mike’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movable kitchen island<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_ClaireKitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24405 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_ClaireKitchen-03-723x1075.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="723" height="1075" /></a>A close-up of the kitchen island on wheels</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a kitchen that’s deemed too small or tight for a kitchen island, the solution is a movable one that can move out of the way when it’s not in use. To replace a butcher block that was too big for the space, Claire and Mike designed a custom piece that was more flexible. With the need for more storage and prep space on their <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wishlist</a>, and with not much room to spare, their Sweeten contractor put the new kitchen island on wheels so that it could sit against the wall or roll into the center of the kitchen.</p>
<h3>A chef&#8217;s best friend: an island for entertaining</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24407 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/steve-upper-east-side-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve and Lauren’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kitchen island with ample bar seating<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For passionate chefs who enjoy cooking and hosting dinners at home, it’s important to keep countertops clear. With the objectives of opening up their kitchen and maximizing prep areas, Steve and Lauren designed a kitchen island that doubled their counter space while adding extra storage below. By choosing a two-tiered island with counter-height on the side facing the interior of the kitchen and bar-height on the side facing the rest of the apartment, the island became dual purpose as a place to cook and easily entertain.</span></p>

<p>Custom kitchen islands can make a big impact on your space, but smaller changes can also increase storage and improve organization. If you love to cook, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a pull-out spice rack or drawer</a> could change your life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">For Frans, a real estate broker, and his wife, Dalal, downsizing from a 2,500 square foot Flatiron District loft to a one-bathroom studio in neighboring Gramercy Park raised only one challenge: Where to put the mudroom! Size was hardly an issue for this unflappable couple, who set out to fit a few custom features into a much lower-maintenance space and came to Sweeten for a general contractor who could bring the vision together. Read on to see how they made room for a mudroom, master closets, and sleeping space for four in this mighty studio!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20138 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-25-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><span id="more-18627"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal were happy to leave behind extra square footage but wanted to bring a few specific features to their new home: A mudroom, to ward off sooty and sometimes snowy layers from city streets, wardrobe closets organized for two, and modern electrical wiring that would support an integrated system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They’d decided on this particular studio apartment because it offered a smaller but markedly similar version of the living room in their loft, and because eventually they planned to relocate to Long Island. So, a revamp would make this home convenient and comfortable until their next adventure, and put everything in place for a future crash pad. Frans enlisted a<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>to achieve the loft-like space they had in mind, while personalizing a number of key features throughout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main studio space was a standard boxy room that backed up to one wall of windows and existing decor was mostly dark and decades old. Because of the single source of light, it took some imagination to carve up the room for use in different ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal designated the windowed area as their new living room, and aimed to update and expand the kitchen, bathroom, and wardrobes while incorporating an urban mudroom into a large hall closet. They also wanted to replace all of the dated finishes throughout the apartment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting with the dark parquet floors, their contractor and his team made way for 7-inch white oak planks from Siberian Wood Flooring, and installed them throughout the home, even replacing the kitchen’s old linoleum black and white floors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original 6 x 8-foot kitchen nook offered very little workspace surrounded by drab brown decor. Directly across from the nook was an oversized closet, which Frans hoped to incorporate into a new, larger kitchen design. The team took on major demolition to create a larger footprint and a workable U-shape, allowing for openness and access. They designed and built custom kitchen cabinetry, finished in putty-gray paint for the bottom cabinets, and white with glass panels for the upper line with seamless metal hardware. A number of cool custom features for specific storage needs are sprinkled throughout, and walnut shelving over the new under-mount sink helps extend the kitchen&#8217;s depth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">White linoleum counters were tossed and replaced with natural white Bianco Brazilian marble with gray veining. Frans and Dalal chose a matte white glass subway-style tile for the backsplash, which now runs up the length of the wall by the new island, where two dining seats, plenty of additional counter space, and black pendant lighting are in easy reach. Top-grade stainless steel appliances replaced the tiny outdated white units, and a large professional-grade hood was fashioned over the 30-inch Bertazzoni gas oven range.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the old closet, their contractor turned part of that into the mudroom Frans and Dalal were after, complete with custom shelving and various storage needs. And as an extension for the new kitchen, white custom cabinetry conceals the refrigerator and houses an exposed wet bar and wine fridge.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal worked with Kris to create two customized and flexible sleeping spaces. Kris built sliding accordion doors out of walnut wood and opaque resin that stack together out of the way when opened, or become solid partition walls when extended and closed off.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom section, Kris built a king-sized platform bed and matching nightstands. In the living room, the team devised a plan for a customized built-in wall unit, incorporating a queen-sized murphy bed and guest closet all conveniently and seamlessly hidden behind white lacquered plywood. Across the room from this addition, Kris installed a single walnut shelf running alongside the wall and just off the floor to corral entertainment equipment and living room knick-knacks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Frans and Dalal had a few simple ideas in mind. Plain white tiles, dim lighting, and very old superficial hardware had outworn their welcome. The couple planned to get rid of all the existing dated decor, change the footprint to allow for a larger, more accessible layout, and customize the adjoining closet to cater to “his and her” needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kris tore everything out and rotated the footprint by 90 degrees to swap the shower and vanity, allowing for greater use of space overall. Old floor tiles were ripped out and light gray ceramic tiles, mimicking that of stone, went down in their place. Upon entering the bathroom directly off the bedroom, you’ll find an oversized white porcelain sink nestled into a new walnut wood vanity built entirely by Kris, finished with ultra modern red and silver metal hardware. To the left of the vanity stands a new glass shower, bedecked with skateboard street-art-style wall tiles for a very artistic, creatively modern, and very hip “New York” aesthetic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new wardrobe situation is impressive. A walk-in closet was already in place, but the couple had a better plan to build a more streamlined and highly organized pass-through closet. Using the door to the old closet, Kris custom built movable shelving units out of corresponding walnut wood for shoes and other sections for hanging clothes. These movable units lead to a separate bathroom entry to the back of the studio, where the living room sits. The homeowners also gained a new compact washer/dryer to complete the turn-around.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Not one to miss the tiniest of details, Frans had the entire apartment wired for temperature, lighting, and sound control he conveniently accesses via phone. Frans and Dalal not only got the mudroom, but also managed to fold in multiple, flexible spaces to this origami apartment. Their new “studio” might be the only one in all of Manhattan with as many separate rooms as they now have, perfectly positioned within one unique space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For five years, I had been parked in a 400 square foot rent-stabilized apartment at a great location on the Upper West Side. As a single person, I felt like it was spacious. When my husband moved <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1178174334" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">in three years</span></span> ago, 400 square feet seemed &#8220;cozy,&#8221; and once I gave birth to our son, Apollo, the space became woefully inadequate. It just could not contain the mountain of stuff that accompanies caring for a baby.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We entered the Manhattan housing market and had a terrible time for a few months; we made several offers and were outbid on everything. All of the two-bedroom apartments within our price range were such wrecks that with construction costs included, they would have been over budget. Two things we knew for sure: we were determined to stay within our budget and I didn&#8217;t want anything that would need the word &#8220;gut&#8221; in it. For the latter, as the saying goes, &#8220;famous last words&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Just when we were about to give up on our search, I decided to go to one last open house for a unit that had been on the market for months. Unbelievably, it was listed at a price that was within our budget and had three bedrooms, even larger than what we were originally hoping to get. It needed some work, but the maintenance was so low that we were convinced even with renovation costs, it would still be within our monthly budget.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The best part was thanks to an unusual catwalk outside the front door &#8212; the apartment actually received three exposures during the day and thus, a ton of light. But inside, it was similar to a “bento box” with lots of walls separating each of the living spaces and blocking all of that great light. The kitchen was dated and the whole thing needed to be gutted.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16388" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3797" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We posted our project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> after hearing from friends who had also found a general contractor on the website. We liked the ability to review candidates’ work online and we were extremely drawn to design-build companies for holistic decisions that would be more likely to contain costs. Sweeten introduced us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a> and I was hooked on their work. I loved the design of their projects and after speaking with their references, we hired them immediately. We were able to get a running start designing the kitchen with Paulina while we were still in the process of closing. As soon as we closed, Paulina&#8217;s group was able to go in and start demolition.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16389" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We went to see the apartment on the first day of demolition at the end of the day. As we stood there in the quiet dusk with the post-demolition dust slowly settling all around us, we both looked at each other with our mouths open…and in a moment of panic, I wondered if they could just put it all back the way it had been and pretend like nothing ever happened.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Once the debris cleared and the actual construction began, things were looking up. Bringing the dividing wall down between the kitchen and living room made a tremendous difference. Light poured in through the kitchen and into the hallways.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Paulina and Albert custom-built the entire kitchen and it looks absolutely fantastic. We opted for classic white custom cabinets and we absolutely love the open shelving that Paulina incorporated per our request. The bookcase that transitions between the living room and kitchen was designed by her, and we love that it is a more natural ending point to the backsplash. Paulina persuaded us that wood countertops would require significant upkeep, so we opted instead for a simple quartz counter that has been great.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We tried to stay within our budget as much as possible and in doing so, decided to keep the perfectly fine (if dated) stove to hopefully be swapped out at a later date. Leon shopped with Paulina to find a narrower and more modern fridge and a new microwave that would match the width of the stove. Leon did the backlighting himself using an electronic LED strip that he controls through his phone. It can wirelessly connect and change colors to reflect the weather or the changes in the stock market. (<em>Editor’s note &#8212; ahem, what?? The stock market!?</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also went with a slightly more modern version of a rustic farmhouse sink and purchased our simple matte black pulls and handles from Ikea.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Our expert team was always professional during all of our interactions, even the ones when we were definitely playing the demanding and nervous first-time renovator role. I&#8217;m not sure we will ever do anything with the word &#8220;gut&#8221; in it again, but this was a great first-time renovating experience and we are so happy in our new home!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, we&#8217;re shifting gears from the usual fare of NYC bath and kitchen renovations to look at how one Upper West Sider made custom changes in every room of a two-bed, two-bath co-op to accommodate her incredible collection of art and books. If you&#8217;ve never seen a full-size Terracotta Warrior sculpture in a Manhattan home, today is your day!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/christines-art-filled-upper-west-side-redesign-and-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13050" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-COVER-B.png" alt="SWEETEN_ChristineApt-COVER-B" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-COVER-B.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-COVER-B-300x200.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-COVER-B-585x390.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>&#8220;I would have been lost &#8211; Sweeten solved the problem of where to begin and the service was amazing. Within two hours of posting my project, I started getting matches. My Sweeten designer was completely on top of everything while I was out of town for four months. I walked out of one apartment in July and into another in October.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><em>&#8211; Christine, Manhattan homeowner</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first sign that Christine had a very specific vision for her New York home came when she was looking at apartments to buy back in 2008. Her top real estate demand? The new place could be no more than ten blocks from Zabar&#8217;s! After finding a combined unit in a boom-era Rosario Candela building, Christine was thrilled with the gracious and spacious layout (a full dining room in which to serve all of her Zabar&#8217;s selections!) but began to imagine a renovation that would replace the outdated finishes and decade-old paint job. The place was absolutely livable and Christine didn&#8217;t know where to start to find professionals for an upgrade, so years passed before she felt ready to take on the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Christine came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a designer who could help her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1885" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create significant storage options and lighting</a> for her extensive library and varied art pieces. Beyond the usual must-haves, Christine also needed someone who could manage the project on her behalf while she spent the summer months in Maine. Most homeowners would be understandably anxious about skipping town while major renovations were underway, but we introduced Christine to this Sweeten designer who signed on to shepherd Christine&#8217;s wish list through to completion and find a home for all of the pieces in the collection.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Christine and her designer set out to solve five major issues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1.</strong> Fresh paint on everything in sight, stat!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.</strong> Crown molding and door frames were mismatched and had been thickly painted during past renovations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.</strong> The kitchen needed a new floor and backsplash tiles and a to-be-determined facelift for the cabinetry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4.</strong> Lighting overhead was no help when Christine wanted to read, cook, and spotlight her favorite works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.</strong> The apartment&#8217;s storage and display options were no match for Christine&#8217;s collection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The designer brought in a team to hit each of these to-do&#8217;s and added her own expertise to help Christine find materials that she would love. In the living room, the designer suggested <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/redirects/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=pewter&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Moore&#8217;s Pewter</a> &#8211; Christine loved the neutral selection and ultimately decided to repeat it in other rooms. Custom shelving for the living room and dining room and new crown molding installations unified the rooms and provide a consistent backdrop for the wall to wall book collection. Throughout the design and installation of each new element, the designer kept Christine up to date via regular Skype calls and photo messages, and translated Christine&#8217;s preferences for shelving height, library lighting, and finishes to the crew. When an order snafu resulted in a delivery of picture lighting without a dimming feature, her designer stepped in, made her way all the way to the president of the company that created the lighting, and managed to get a full set of replacements at no extra charge.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, the designer found an ornate cement encaustic tile from <a href="https://www.mosaichse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mosaic House</a> to replace cracked ceramic floor tiles. Christine loves the look and feel of these and immediately took to her designer&#8217;s suggestion for handmade, hexagonal backsplash tiles in various shades of white and gray. The crew debated refreshing the kitchen cabinets with a new coat of paint but ultimately decided to replace them altogether with brand new doors and detailed pulls. Under-cabinet LED lighting helped meet Christine&#8217;s call for more lighting in the kitchen, and crisp molding now provides a beautiful transition from the ground up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Here’s a primer on kitchen cabinets, from custom designs to stock options</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinet construction may well end up being the&nbsp;single biggest expense of your entire renovation, and the results are the most obvious visual proof of your investment, so this can feel like a heavy decision. The challenge (and opportunity) is that your choices are endless, but if you focus on a few key factors, you can find the right cabinets for your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20751 mb-24 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="487" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br>
IKEA cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Matthew&#8217;s kitchen renovation</a>.</p>
<p>While it’s tempting to assume that your budget is the only consideration and while it’s true that custom cabinets can be (much, much) more expensive than stock cabinets, they don’t have to be.&nbsp;Even the cheapest kitchen is an enormous investment, so if budget isn’t necessarily the deciding factor, how should you decide and how can you keep your budget from dictating your choices? First, a few definitions.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color=""></a></p>
<h2>Should you go with custom or pre-fabricated cabinets?</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stock cabinets</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA</a>&nbsp;is widely considered the go-to for stock cabinets. Unlike almost anyone else, they mass-produce a system of set sizes, colors, finishes, and features that you pick and choose. The pieces of your order are pulled from stock supplies and shipped to your home, where you need to handle both the assembly and installation. IKEA keeps its costs low because they are sending your order to you in pieces and because the materials they use are very inexpensive.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pre-fabricated cabinets</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lowes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lowe’s</a>,&nbsp;and other big-box national retailers are distributors of independent lines of cabinets. They offer a semi-custom option: like IKEA, you pick and choose from set sizes, colors, finishes, and features (though national retailers tend to have more options overall). Unlike IKEA, your order is then manufactured and assembled for you so that your cabinets arrive ready for installation. Because you have more choice in materials and construction, the range of prices varies more here. You will probably pay more upfront for higher-quality materials, but you may spend less on labor because the cabinets are assembled before they get to you for installation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Custom cabinets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets are designed and constructed by hand based on your individual design. You define the sizes, materials, finishes, and features and your order is hand-crafted and delivered for installation.&nbsp;Because your choices for materials and construction are endless, the range of material and labor costs is very wide. The costs here are generally distributed between your choice of material and style, labor, and a more personalized design and customer service approach.</p>
<h3><strong>High-end, built-to-order cabinet systems</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A small group of cabinet companies also offer cabinetry systems that are extremely high-end (<a href="https://bulthaup.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulthaup</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.henrybuilt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henrybuilt</a>&nbsp;are examples). These companies are known for beautiful and durable cabinet construction and best-in-industry warranties, but the bare minimum for even&nbsp;a small kitchen can easily exceed <strong>$20,000</strong>, so unlike other categories of cabinet construction, this option is only available if the starting point for your budget allows you to consider it.</p>

Custom cabinets by Henrybuilt in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kavi and David&#8217;s kitchen</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets might be less expensive than you think if your kitchen has limited space, lots of space, or an unusual layout.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a tight kitchen, stock and pre-fabricated cabinets in standard sizes might not be worth the initial material savings because you will need more inventive labor to fit everything in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a large kitchen, extra depth or high ceilings give you an opportunity for additional storage and functionality. Non-standard cabinet heights and depths can bring value to your renovation and re-sale value. Multiple corners, awkward niches, and unusual footprints can be&nbsp;tough to outfit. Stock and pre-fab cabinets in standard sizes may force you to spend money on filler materials, wasted space, and labor for semi-custom adjustments.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“If you have a kitchen with corners or small spaces or an awkward layout, you may not actually save money on the total because you end up paying for filler materials and extra work to pull everything together.” &#8211;&nbsp;Sweeten contractors</i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-24618 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-723x1087.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel cost" width="723" height="1087" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-723x1087.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br>
<span style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets in </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-woodwork-manhattan-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric&#8217;s kitchen</a><span style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;designed and built by his </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a><span style="text-align: justify;">.</span></p>
<h3>Custom cabinets might be worth extra money if you plan to stay for years, have kids or a high-traffic kitchen, or want personalized support.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Semi-custom and custom cabinets offer higher&nbsp;quality materials in sturdier thicknesses that last longer.&nbsp;Particle board and MDF, two common materials for stock cabinets, are susceptible to water and have a shorter life span than plywood and wood. 1/2” particle board will not last as long as 3/4” or 1” furniture-grade plywood cabinet bases, and solid wood doors and drawers will endure tougher handling over the years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets also typically use sturdier construction and joinery methods. Custom cabinetmakers will often use dovetail joints that interlock pieces of wood to distribute weight and stress more evenly, whereas stock nut, bolt, and nail methods isolate wear on a few points. They also offer options for tougher hardware elements like hinges and drawer sliders. In addition, custom cabinet makers generally provide a higher level of design support and customer assistance. They will do site visits, re-designs, and get a real person on the phone with you when you need it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You might be absolutely fine to handle the ordering and delivery of a stock system, but if you hit a roadblock, custom cabinet companies expect to support you and respond personally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Once you order the IKEA materials and you pay for assembly and installation, you’re not far off from a custom option that would last longer and provide more options – for a few extra thousand dollars, you may actually get a much better deal.&nbsp;Each time you take one of these steps up in material quality and thickness, you have a corresponding price and life span increase.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Alan<br>

<h3>Cost aside, pre-fabricated cabinets might work best for you if your renovation timeline is speedy or you feel overwhelmed by choice.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets have lengthier lead times. If you’re gearing up for a renovation in the next two months, you can get your hands on pre-fab cabinets in-store on a same-day basis, or delivered within two or three weeks. And, a perceived weakness of pre-fabricated cabinets is actually a real strength: for many homeowners, unlimited choice is not necessarily desirable. Many homeowners go with custom cabinets because they think they want options and then end up feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed. Pre-fabricated cabinets offer a pick-and-choose experience that requires less homework and decision fatigue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Many clients ask us what styles we offer and it can be hard to explain that it can be anything they imagine. Shops like ours provide personalized&nbsp;design as part of the overall service to build features for individual clients.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a></i></p>
<h3>Still having trouble deciding? Go for a&nbsp;hybrid!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Combining a pre-fab kitchen with custom pieces can lower your cost without compromising on quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Combining a pre-fab kitchen with custom pieces allows for lower cost and uniqueness. Companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.semihandmade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semihandmade</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://kokeena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kokeena</a>&nbsp;make door and drawer faces for stock cabinets so you’re not limited to IKEA’s palette. In addition, there are endless options for shelving, countertops, and cabinet pulls&nbsp;allowing for individuality while using inexpensive pre-fab cabinets.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Lauren and Adam</a></i></p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/custom-built-in-bookshelves-cover.jpg" alt="Custom built-in bookshelves in a bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56428" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/custom-built-in-bookshelves-cover.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/custom-built-in-bookshelves-cover-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/custom-built-in-bookshelves-cover-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner Claudia&#8217;s custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in bookshelves</a> in NYC</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Built-ins: Resourceful and good-looking</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You’ll find </span><span class="s2">built-in bookshelves</span><span class="s1"> defined as entire pieces of cabinetry that are extensions of a wall. They are known for being clever space-savers and are a substantial piece of millwork. Typically custom-sized—from floor to ceiling and any width—these </span><span class="s2">built-in cabinets</span><span class="s1"> offer up maximum storage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the expertise of <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors from NYC, we break down the elements that go into the cost for custom built-in bookshelves: materials, labor, and site conditions. Have a better understanding of what goes into the process of creating millwork, and how it factors into <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your renovation budget</a> as a whole.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Average costs on built-in bookshelves </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While a basic internet search brings up a lot of information on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen remodeling costs</a> or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom renovation costs</a>, rates for built-in cabinets are harder to find. </span><span class="s1">This is due in part to the uniqueness of these projects—no two are the same! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That said, many millworkers rely on a linear footage model as a basis for calculating pricing, with various factors affecting overall cost. In urban areas like New York City, the range starts between $800 to $1,000 per linear foot for basic open shelving.</span></p>
<h4>Why are custom bookshelves so expensive?</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The number one misconception is the expected cost. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experienced GCs will guide you</a> on the several important factors that will attribute to creating your custom built-in bookshelves, according to NYC-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractors Nina and Ilya</a>.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Materials – “Lumber is expensive,” said Nina. “It may not look like it but there’s a lot of wood involved in turning the raw material into the finished product.” </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Labor – This cost includes “preplanning, labor, studio, and shop work to prefabricate the product,” they said. “It then gets delivered to the site for installation.”</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Site condition – The existing condition of the space will determine if additional time and attention is required in designing or installing the project. Are the walls bowed or the floors uneven? Are there finishes that need to be matched to existing furniture or flooring? Other site variations can affect the price. Read more about site conditions below.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Custom built-ins result in a one-of-a-kind piece made to your exact specifications that fit precisely into your space. The work that goes into a custom built-in piece often extends beyond what homeowners can imagine: Skilled experts source the materials, design, build, and perfect the unit before transporting it from the workshop to your home.</p>
<p>In the end, you are paying for both service and craftsmanship, elements that are usually missing from an &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; experience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-19993 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Deeksha_Living_Room-04-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Deeksha and Joe wanted an old-style <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-interior-wall-of-windows-brings-light-to-this-guest-alcove/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC built-in bookcase</a></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A note on material delays</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractors note that markets have been experiencing a </span><span class="s2">backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. </span><span class="s1">“We’ve been experiencing some shortages in wood, lacquer, and paint,” said Ilya.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For NYC homeowners interested in renovating, consider <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s3">finding a licensed general contractor</span></a>, scheduling, and signing them to lock in material prices. Your contractor will be able to get your material orders in the queue.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They suggest building the delays into your timeline. “It’s taking 12–16 weeks for cabinets and built-ins from start to install,” said Ilya. “Stock cabinets deliver the fastest,” he said. “The more customized the design, the more it will add to the delivery time.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Custom bookshelves: Materials, installation, other features</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get an accurate estimate, you’ll need to take a few other variables into account. For example, the average range of</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">$800 to $1,000 per linear foot usually assumes that the unit will be no taller than eight feet.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">Excess height will translate into higher costs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/custom-built-in-bookcase-living-room.jpg" alt="Custom built-in cabinets in a living area" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56426" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/custom-built-in-bookcase-living-room.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/custom-built-in-bookcase-living-room-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/custom-built-in-bookcase-living-room-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are other factors that can impact the budget of built-ins:</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s3">Materials for custom bookshelves</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The multitude of options includes solid woods, plywood, medium-density fiberboard (MDF), veneers, high-pressure laminate, and melamine. The good news is you’ll definitely find a style to suit your style and needs. Some points to think about:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Solid wood</b> is the gold standard because it is both classic and timeless. While solid wood is usually strong and sturdy, some types may crack, buckle, or shrink when subject to heat and humidity.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>MDF</b> is a good option when you’re on a budget or if you plan on painting the shelves. It is composed of dried, pressed recycled wood fibers and resin. It withstands temperature changes better than many kinds of wood. It also acts as an excellent substrate for veneers.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Plywood</b> is an engineered wood like MDF but essentially made of pressed sheets of wood veneer, which is why layers are visible along the edges. Higher grades of plywood are used for cabinets and shelving, while lower grades are what you might see in housing construction and subfloors. As with solid woods, you can choose different types of plywood such as maple, pine, or birch.</span></li>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Finishes for custom bookshelves</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">After choosing the materials, decide how you’d like your shelves finished. Options to consider:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Paint</b> is the go-to option. With this route, there may be a price difference based on the method of application (brush, roller, or spray), and the quality and brand of the paint you choose.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Solid</b> <b>lacquer </b>is a popular choice, which provides hard, glossy finishes that range in the level of sheen from clear to colored. Lacquer produces an extremely damage-resistant finish. It’s ideal for projects that see a lot of traffic, such as low shelving in a child’s room.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Varnish</b> is usually transparent but also comes in a range of glossy to satin finishes. Like lacquer, it produces a durable finish.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Unfinished</b> shelving creates a more industrial contemporary look.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">A lot of labor goes into producing a high-quality painted finish. (For a case study, read about the time and labor spent on <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/"><span class="s3">Kate and Arthur’s DIY cabinets</span></a>.) The entire process can take up to five days and include up to four coats of primer and finish. Compared to two to three coats of a high-quality clear lacquer that can be applied in as little as one day. The additional labor costs easily offset the savings of less expensive, “paint-grade” materials.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Site conditions</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The type of building structure you live in—house, apartment, walk-up, or elevator—contributes to pricing differentials when it comes to built-ins. Projects in apartments often take longer to deliver and install than those in houses. “Labor costs increase when materials need to be maneuvered in a walk-up building,” Ilya said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In addition to the logistics of parking and unloading on a busy city street, some apartment buildings have strict work hours for contractors. This can limit the amount of work that they can finish in one day, stretching a one-day installation into two.</span><span class="s3"> </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Features and components of custom bookshelves</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Simple open shelving is the least expensive built-in option. Most experts don’t calculate costs per additional drawer or door. However, the more features you include, the higher the overall cost. Glass doors or shelves, a floating desk, and lighting all add cost in time and materials.</span></p>
<p>Custom built-ins may conjure up visions of grand homes but, in fact, are great space-savers in smaller homes. These cabinets are the touch of millwork to up your storage game in any room. <span class="s4">When you’re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/"><span class="s5">renovate with the best contractors in NYC</span></a>.</span></p>
