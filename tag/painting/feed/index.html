<h3><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="white-living-room-brown-vinyl-floor" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33688" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06.jpg" alt="white living room with brown vinyl floor and a white barn door after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your house needs a few improvements and you have the urge to do them all immediately. Every project seems to announce itself with equal priority. Unless you’re awash in money and time, you cannot address all at once. You need to sift through your priorities—starting with knowing where to splurge vs. save during a renovation. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Below, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> helps you understand where to splurge vs. save so you can define your priorities.</span></p>
<h3>What does splurging mean?</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Splurging doesn’t mean overspending. It can mean shifting money from one project to another. Or placing one project higher on the to-do list than other projects. Splurge on things that you touch or see often. Splurge on things that are meaningful to you or which make you happy. </span></p>
<h3>What does saving mean?</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Saving doesn’t mean to skip or ignore. It means that you can safely put it on the back burner for now. Or if you want to do it, you can dial down on the cost a bit. Many times, after the project has been on the back burner long enough, you might see it in a clearer light.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Once you think in terms of splurge vs. save during a renovation, all of these home projects fall into an order that makes perfect sense.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: Kitchens</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">Splurge: Kitchen Countertops</span></strong></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Every day, you touch, see, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use your kitchen countertops</a>. Whether you choose quartz, solid surface, natural stone, laminate, or wood, your countertop choice is semi-permanent. After the design, fabrication, and installation, changing out your countertop shouldn&#8217;t be taken lightly. If you want a certain type of quartz countertop, but choose a shade or pattern that you don’t feel strongly about, ask yourself: How will I feel about this in a year? </span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Kitchen Appliances</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchen appliances are better designed than ever. The rising tide of improved kitchen technology lifts all boats—even for lower-priced appliances. With research, you can find lower-cost refrigerators, dishwashers, cooktops, and ranges that fit your needs. These appliances often match or exceed the quality of higher-priced versions from only a few years ago. </span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: </span><span class="s1">Bathrooms</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Bathroom Fixtures</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bathroom fixtures are more than just mechanical devices. They aren&#8217;t just knobs and levers that start and stop the water. Fixtures are ornaments that complement a beautiful shower, tub, or sink. Spend more to splurge vs. save for bathroom fixtures that make you happy.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Bathroom Technology</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Technology has entered all parts of our lives, so why not the bathroom, too? IoT, or the Internet of Things, is a concept that describes how common things within our life are now Internet-equipped. Bathroom technology and IoT are not gimmicks! IoT devices can track water usage, regulate heating, and allow the bathroom to better adapt to your needs. Bathroom technology has its place, and it is the future. But for now, you can limit your bathroom smart devices or put them on the back burner.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: </span><span class="s1">Living rooms</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Paint</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That designer paint that you’ve been eyeing? Now it can be yours. You can easily justify spending more on the premium paint that you want in the living room. That’s because the living room gets so much facetime, and it’s so public. Poor quality paint may flake, chip, or fade over time, costing more in the end. When you decide to splurge instead of save on your desired paint, you’ll be happier in the long run.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Lighting</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Living room lighting, while necessary, does not need to be expensive. Prioritize the shape and the finish of the lighting fixture over the brand name. One trick of designers is to over-scale lighting fixtures for a dramatic look. Just make sure that all of the in-wall wiring for sconces and ceiling lights is complete first!</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: </span><span class="s1">Bedrooms</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Bedroom Closet systems</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An unfinished closet is an empty box waiting for your stuff. However, that stuff has no place to go unless you create a system. Gone are the days of the closet rod with one shelf above it. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Closet storage systems</a> belong in all closets now. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Reach-in closets benefit from a shoe fence or shoe cubby, two or three drawers, and plenty of open shelving, plus a closet rod. Walk-in closets should be outfitted with the same and more: additional shelves and drawers, pull-out baskets, multiple hanging areas, and lighting.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Millwork and trim</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Custom millwork and trim are the finishing touches for homes. If yours is a home of architectural significance, custom trim throughout is practically required. But if you want to save money, you can ease back on the fancy millwork in the private areas of the home. Save the ceiling medallions, crown molding, chair rails, dentils, batten, and picture rails for the dining and living areas.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: </span><span class="s1">Basements</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Basement Flooring</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Moisture is usually the deciding factor when you consider <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whether or not to finish your basement</a>. Prevalent moisture can turn an expensive basement remodel into an uninhabitable area best used for storage. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An attractive, moisture-shedding floor covering and a subfloor system can make a world of difference. Begin with the subfloor system, interlocking 24-inch squares that elevate your floor covering about 1-inch. Then, choose a basement-ready floor covering that you love, whether ceramic or porcelain tile, luxury vinyl planks, engineered wood flooring, or laminate flooring.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Guest bedrooms</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Building out a guest bedroom in your basement is a wise move when you know that it will get frequent use, either by friends and family or as a rental unit. But if you want a guest bedroom in your basement only for the occasional visitor, you’re taking up valuable space best used for other activities.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: Attics</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Built-in storage</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Built-in storage doesn’t often rank high in priority in other parts of the house, but this is not the case for attics. Attics are starved for space to begin with. Once you add furniture, you have even less storage room. Knee walls are the short walls that extend from the floor to the rafters. Knee walls that have built-in storage should be built during the remodeling process, not later.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Full bathrooms</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Full bathrooms—toilet, sink, and shower or shower/tub—are a rarity in attics unless the intent is to build out an entire suite with living quarters. Otherwise, attics used as offices or children’s play areas work well with just a half-bathroom.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs Save: Decks</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Deck Flooring</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your choice of deck flooring can easily make or break how much you end up using—and loving or avoiding—your deck. With that in mind, you’ll want to prioritize decking.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For the best in looks and maximum strength, choose a premium wood such as ipe or mahogany. Both are long-lasting, easy to maintain, and they return maximum resale value. Composite wood—a mixture of wood fibers and plastics—is smooth, splinter-free underfoot, and looks remarkably like wood.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Deck Built-ins</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Built-ins such as benches, tables, and planters are wonderful additions to decks. Built-in benches are especially valuable because they tuck away to the side, opening up more space in the center of the deck. Yet one way to pare down your deck-building budget is to save the built-ins for a later day. The same builder (or a different one) can always come back and create those built-ins that your heart desires.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Splurge vs. Save in a Renovation: Conclusion</strong></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Almost every room in a home would gladly use a piece of the budget. Knowing what projects can wait until a later date, or what may or may not maximize the full breadth of the room, can help guide on where to splurge vs. save in your renovation.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These walls have a smooth reputation</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want the walls of your home to look flawless, skim coating will make them as smooth as silk. This technique allows you to get the surface of your walls perfectly even by sanding down bumps and spreading plaster to fill in nicks and scratches. Although <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the process can be expensive</a>, for many, the beautiful results are well worth the cost. Below, five Sweeten homeowners skim coated their walls, addressing uneven surfaces and imperfections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29899 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-723x482.jpg" alt="skim coating" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a seamless look, each of the three bedrooms in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marsha and Adam’s</a> townhouse were skim coated and painted in Benjamin Moore&#8217;s Super White. The walls act like a blank canvas, allowing the couple’s modern, mid-century furniture and decor to take center stage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26867 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="skim coating" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main goals of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-bookcases-prewar-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cat and Jordan&#8217;s</a> renovation was to make their apartment “look as big, bright, and clean as possible.” At first, Jordan didn’t want to spend the extra money on skim coating, but he’s glad they went for it. “I can’t believe what a difference it made—the whole place looks lighter, brighter, and fresher.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26527 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="skim coating" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While renovating the kitchen and bathroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy and Nick</a> stripped old molding from their apartment and replaced it with crisp new trim. Next, the walls, ceilings, and doors were skim coated and given a fresh coat of paint to create a clean backdrop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23098 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="skim coating" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thinking outside the box led <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/apartment-party-four-five/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam and Sean</a> to take down the walls that boxed in their kitchen, cutting it off from the living room. The remaining walls needed to be brightened up. Skim coating and paint provided the much-needed facelift.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20091 mb-0 size-chrono" title="studio apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-723x482.jpg" alt="skim coating" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before work began, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren</a> asked her contractor if there was anything missing from the scope of her project. He suggested skim coating the walls and ceilings, pointing out bowed beams and the uneven surface of the walls. Lauren took his advice and the impact of the update made the apartment feel brand new again.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Welcome to #6 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>What is skim coating and why is it so expensive?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>Skim coating is a process that essentially makes your walls look perfect. Every wall is a sandwich of different materials. Those materials—drywall, tape, and mud—are there to help insulate your home and keep you warm and dry. When it comes to the interior finish, you’ll want it to look as smooth as possible, and that’s really hard when, from certain angles, you can see where all of those materials come together. Skim coating takes the same mud that is used in the construction of the walls and spreads it across the surface—almost like a layer of frosting—before smoothing it by hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you need skim coating? No. Is it amazing when it’s done really well? Yes, because your walls look perfect under any kind of lighting. Why is it so expensive? Because someone has to go on a ladder with a flashlight and hand-sand the walls to make sure they’re perfectly smooth. That takes a while because it’s a vertical surface. It’s certainly your choice, but it definitely looks beautiful when it’s done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">The cost to paint the interior of a home depends on the complexity of the project</h2>
<h2 class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23909 mb-0 size-chrono" title="beige-kitchen-yellow-wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-723x510.jpg" alt="beige kitchen with yellow highlight wall and white kitchen cabinets after renovation" width="723" height="510" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-723x510.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-300x212.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-600x424.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are pretty good that you’ve painted your walls before. Interior painting is a project that many are willing to tackle solo, and the prospect of a DIY job can be tempting given that the outlay is just the cost of paint and some inexpensive tools. But going pro is often the right choice, with real costs and real benefits, especially when painting is part of a more ambitious home renovation. Let’s take a look at why there are such wide variations in cost, and how to decide who is right for the job.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br /></a><b>Costs for painting by the gallon &amp; necessary equipment</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many options for paint, but tried and true staples such as <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Moore</a>, <a href="https://www.behr.com/consumer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behr</a>, <a href="https://www.askval.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valspar</a>, and <a href="https://www.sherwin-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sherwin Williams</a> are all available at your local hardware store or a big box store like Home Depot or Lowe’s. By the gallon, these brands rarely exceed $50 and usually average around $30, depending on the specifics. You can also go upscale with a luxury paint like Farrow &amp; Ball, where a gallon will run you $100, or <a href="https://www.finepaintsofeurope.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fine Paints of Europe</a>, at approximately $110 a gallon. Additionally, you’ll probably need to pay for primer, which averages around the same cost as paint. The rest of the supplies—rollers, extenders, brushes, trays/pans, and paper or tarp—will represent a small percentage of your total budget. For example, a brush costs a few dollars at any local hardware store, and a 36” x 900’ roll of brown paper costs $39 at Home Depot (enough for a very large paint job.)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Variables that&#8217;ll impact costs to paint a home&#8217;s interior </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here’s where it gets more complicated: like most other types of renovation work, painting is very site-specific. This means that all the charming idiosyncrasies of your prewar apartment (e.g., the crown moldings, prized paneling, that curved hallway wall) translate into higher painting costs. Many experts will refuse to provide a bid without a site visit, and with good reason. They need to make a visual assessment of the condition of the walls and surroundings before providing a competitive estimate. They will want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What condition are the walls in and how much prep will be required?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How high are the ceilings, what are the specific dimensions of the surfaces, and how much trim detail is there?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the quality of work in the rest of the apartment? (This helps them assess where to land on the spectrum of “rental grade” to “luxury” in terms of the finished product.)</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there furniture to work around? How much of it?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there lead present in the existing paint?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the building restrictions on construction work?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where is the site?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23910 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-highlight-wall-breakfast-nook" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-723x1083.jpg" alt="blue highlight wall in a breakfast nook with dining table and hanging pendant lights after renovation " width="723" height="1083" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-723x1083.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Painters use all of this information to assess how many labor hours the job will require. For example, they take into account how much commuting time will be required, and how long a day they will be allowed to work. They think about whether they’ll have to circle the block and monitor a meter, or if they can just park in your driveway. And, they note how much prep will be necessary, in addition to the actual painting time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One other variable to keep in mind is that small projects tend to offer less bang for your buck because there is some time that elapses between steps. For example, if your project is limited to one bedroom, there isn’t anything else the workers can do while they are waiting for the primer to dry, whereas if your project includes more rooms, they can alternate working in different spaces. For a small project, you end up paying for the whole day anyway, because waiting becomes part of the job.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Labor costs for painting </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, painters are often willing to provide their per-hour rate to clients, unlike general contractors or millworkers, whose projects are not as easily broken down into an hourly rate. This means that once you know the per-hour rate that your painter charges, and how many hours the job will take, there is very little mystery to how your project will be billed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While hourly labor rates do vary, they typically start at about $25 to $30 per hour on the low end and average around $50 to $60 per hour for an experienced painter (not a huge range.)</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Preparation before interior painting walls</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The real disparity in painting costs arise because of the amount of time spent on prep. Prep work is what makes the difference between a rental-grade finished product and a high-end, luxury one. Perfectly smooth walls and incisive clean lines are difficult (and thus expensive) to come by, so it is often just a question of how much imperfection a homeowner is willing to live with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If one painter provides a $5,000 bid for a project while another painter bids $3,000, most of the difference will be in the amount of prep. The higher bid will probably involve carefully “raking” the walls (a process that involves darkening the room and using a small spotlight to highlight problem spots), systematically repairing all the spots, applying and sanding down compound, and then a thorough cleaning of all the surfaces to ensure maximum paint adhesion. The lower bid will likely skip over some of these steps to reduce labor hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unsurprisingly, detail work takes a lot of prep. Taping and prep steps double as soon as you introduce a line of molding in a contrasting color, and trim details are critical focal points so your design choices and architectural details will come into play in determining project timeline and cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many renovators have also wondered about skim-coating, a particularly time-intensive (and thus costly) aspect of prep work. Skim-coating is a process in which you smooth out the wall by rolling thinned-out, all-purpose joint compound (“mud”) on the walls, and then immediately smooth it out with a knife edge. Because the mud dries quickly, it can only be applied in small patches. And each layer is thin, so it may require multiple layers to even out very bumpy or textured walls. Although it sounds relatively simple, it requires skill and experience to do well. As a result, skim-coating is billed separately, and at a higher rate (roughly $10 to $20 more expensive than painting by the hour), and will also take more time than the painting itself. That combination of a higher hourly rate and more time needed for skim-coating can easily double the cost of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Skim-coating is a big undertaking. If you’re on the fence about whether your walls need it, you might compromise by focusing on areas that are well lit (where defects are easy to see) or in rooms that you plan to paint with a gloss or semi-gloss paint (these finishes tend to magnify imperfections). You might decide that a very visible wall that gets lots of natural light needs the full treatment, while walls that aren’t quite as prominent or immediately visible upon entry get a bit less focus. Pause in each room and think about where your eye hits when you walk in and out and when you are naturally using the room. You may find that only one out of four walls really needs the re-surfacing that skim-coating provides.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And lastly, if there is lead paint detected in your home, there are additional steps that workers must take to contain dust. Painters will need to ensure special staging of the work site with plastic tarp, and use special vacuums that do not recirculate dust into the air. Again, more time spent prepping equals more money.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review surfaces and walls before beginning to paint </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a homeowner, you can start by assessing the condition and complexity of the space, and think through how much prep and perfection you want to include in your budget. An empty room with walls in decent condition might just need one to two painters over one to two days of work to get a fresh coat up, whereas an entire home with varied surfaces and heavy furniture will require a full team working over the course of two weeks or more to prep, paint, and finish across a variety of spaces.</p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">Hardware or big box stores like Home Depot or Lowe’s will usually charge $30-50/gallon. Upscale paint brands can cost $100/gallon or more. Calling in experts? Painting labor starts at $25-30/hour, with an average of $50-60/hour for experienced painting contractors. The amount of prep the walls will need before being painted will also factor heavily into final costs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each week we visit a member of Sweeten network to check out what they are working on. This week we thought we&#8217;d try something new and share a bit about a homeowner.<a href="https://dbryantarchie.com/"><br />
</a><a href="https://dbryantarchie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D. Bryant Archie</a> is a textile designer and Brooklyn homeowner member of Sweeten community. D&#8217;s apartment, located in Prospect Lefferts Gardens, is painted with rich deep color tones while her bathroom was a basic Decorator&#8217;s White. So she hired one of our members to paint the bathroom with vertical strips in Benjamin Moore China White and Onyx. Now her bathroom works to complete &amp; compliment the overall look and feel of the apartment.</p>

For this all he needed was a steady hand and years of practice, no tape!</p>

<p>10 questions for contractor: Color Your Space<br />
Swee10 Profile: <a href="https://sweeten.com/">https://sweeten.com/</a></p>
<p>1. Your Name and your company’s name?  My name is Don Zuniga.  I have a small company called &#8220;Color Your Space.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. How long has the company been in business?  I&#8217;ve been doing business for over 12 years, but only 2 years as CYS.</p>
<p>3. How many people work at the company?  Its a small company.  I do most of the work, and have a part-time worker.  I also know other skilled craftsmen who I work with on larger projects.</p>
<p>4. What is the specialty?  I specialize in Interior Painting, but I also do faux finishes, molding, and wallpaper.</p>
<p>5. How did you personally get into contracting?  My dad is a contractor, so I grew up working and learning on his projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2679/4518474957_d6efc85ed3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async"  class="mb-0" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2679/4518474957_d6efc85ed3.jpg" alt="Color Your Space_three" width="550" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>6. Tell us about the job you’re most proud of in your career?  About 8 years ago, when I was first starting on my own in Boston, I restored a colonial brownstone in Jamaica Plains:  the floors, tile, molding, and walls.  It was amazing to see the difference, because it was in raw, worn-out shape, and when i finished, it was immaculate.  I actually got 4 or 5 referrals from that job alone, and did some work for designers who saw my work.</p>
<p>7. Do you have a web site? Has it helped you get business?  I do.  My website is <a href="https://www.coloryourspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.coloryourspace.com</a> .  It helps business because it gives people a sense of what I do, and lets then see some of my work.  I think having a website shows people that you are invested, and legitimate, and not just a guy who started painting or doing this kind of work yesterday because he needs a way to make money.</p>
<p>8. Tell us about you’re most nightmarish job?  I was doing a wall repair and painting job on West 81st street and Riverside Drive a few years back.  As I was working on a wall, the entire master bedroom wall began to crumble, because the plaster  was so moist from rain damage.  THE ENTIRE WALL.  I didn&#8217;t anticipate that.  You never know what&#8217;s going to happen when you start poking a damaged wall.</p>
<p>9. If you could change the construction process, how would you change it?   Its difficult to answer this, since each job is wholly different from another, so the process is always changing.</p>
<p>10. If you weren’t a contractor, what would you be?  A lawyer.  I have a law degree, but little desire to sit in a stuffy office with a suit on.</p>
