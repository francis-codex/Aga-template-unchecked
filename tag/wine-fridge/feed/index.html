<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Written in partnership with homeowners Danielle and Michelle</span></em></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Remodeling a converted condo in Hoboken, New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We purchased our home in June 2020, a 1,100-square-foot condominium in a former 1800s schoolhouse. The downtown Hoboken, NJ building was converted into condos 30 years ago, and we love its character—our apartment has 24-foot ceilings with original wood beams.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02.jpg" alt="Galley kitchen with bar seating and black cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52149" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are Danielle, an attorney, and Michelle, a human resources manager, and our plan was to move here with our two cats, Sylvia and Eleanor. We knew going into the purchase that we would renovate the kitchen and bath. Both needed a facelift. We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/67197" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project on Sweeten</a>, with accurate specs, and soon got responses from contractors interested in working with us. It wasn’t long before we found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5676#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a contractor we felt was a great fit</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our goals for the renovation were easy to convey, since the existing rooms’ shortcomings were obvious. The kitchen was closed off from the rest of the living area and outdated—we wanted to open it up and connect it to the living area. It was not only badly designed, but in poor condition, too. The cabinets were falling apart; we had to lift one of the doors with a foot to open or close the dishwasher. The bathroom was also in bad shape, with cracked tiles and water damage.</span></p>
<h3>A black kitchen, bold yet neutral</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wanted our remodel to be clean, modern, and simple, but still a statement. In 5 to 10 years, it should still look updated. We chose black cabinets and other features because they would stand out and look timeless. Neutral tones would complement decorative accents, and we like the clean feeling of white surfaces. We also wanted natural elements that would tie to the condo’s existing wood floors and warm up the space. We felt the palette would come together to create a modern, edgy vibe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04.jpg" alt="View of the renovated galley kitchen with open shelving and globe lights" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52151" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03.jpg" alt="Renovated kitchen with beige tile, black cabinets, and white marble counter" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52150" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our objectives in the kitchen included opening the room, increasing storage, and tailoring the cabinets and drawers to our specific needs. Seating would be added to the design to keep the cook company during dinner prep.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In planning the layout, the inclusion of base <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/semihandmade-cabinets-up-the-ante-without-the-pricetag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinets with drawers to maximize storage</a> was important to us. We wanted, too, to add a pantry, which the kitchen did not previously have; we managed to fit it in just right of the fridge. We were excited to find matte black cabinets—they look expensive but were more affordable than traditional cabinets, and almost as customizable. Plus, they’re made from recycled plastic! The wooden floating shelves add not only a natural touch but easy-access storage for dishes and glasses.</span></p>
<h3>Creating a home baker&#8217;s kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The plan also included new appliances and we decided to splurge on a high-end package. Danielle is an avid baker and successfully jumped on the sourdough bandwagon when the pandemic began—she loves being able to preheat the oven from her phone. We were set on a full-size fridge with an ice maker. We also fit in the world’s smallest wine refrigerator, at about six inches wide. We don’t drink much but love to have a few cold bottles on hand—this fridge holds seven.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06.jpg" alt="Black cabinets, stainless steel appliances, white marble counters, natural wood shelving" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52153" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Wallpaper and black paint for a bathroom</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the bathroom, we wanted to go simple and coordinate with the kitchen. We wanted the space to feel connected, and to that end, we kept to a similar neutral color scheme and same tile shapes. We installed a glass shower, knowing that the transparent walls would make this space feel bigger. In any case, we already have a tub upstairs. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went with a statement wallpaper</a>. We thought it made sense to go playful in the small bathroom. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">What we did participate in was shopping for all of our materials, creating our vision and the end result!</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09.jpg" alt="Bathroom with walk-in shower, vanity, and large mirror" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52156" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Managing during the home remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As first-time renovators, we were unsure about the timing of various phases and what the overall costs would be. We talked about when the materials, which we sourced on our own, needed to come. During the renovation, w</span><span class="s1">e retreated to Danielle’s parents’ home in Arizona. The condo is an open loft and isn’t conducive to phone calls—we didn’t think it would be possible to live, work, and renovate from home.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">What we did participate in was shopping for all of our materials, creating our vision and the end result!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was hard not being able to see the project’s daily progress, and to step back from our inclinations to micro-manage. But we did. We communicated our choices and concerns to our Sweeten contractor, from afar, usually over texts or on phone calls. Our contractor was patient and sent pictures as progress updates. Along the way, we learned the importance of communicating—ask questions and tell your contractor what you want, as you are your best advocate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07.jpg" alt="Bathroom with black and white walls and vanity" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52154" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08.jpg" alt="Bathroom with glass shower door and black matte hardware" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52155" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since we had a great relationship with our contractor, and we made all of the budgetary and design decisions, we didn’t end up needing to use some services Sweeten had to offer. Still, we were grateful for the match with a contractor we knew was vetted. We felt peaceful knowing that Sweeten had our back if an issue were to arise.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Tips on staying on budget</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we had one piece of advice to share, it would be about the budget. Figure out what your limit is—the one that you can actually afford. From there, expect a few unexpected costs. Go through your projection line by line with your contractor and be clear about what isn’t included in their quote. If money is a concern, pick a few pieces you’re in love with to splurge on and go for more affordable options for everything else. We paid about $50,000 for both rooms, all-inclusive of work and materials. We went for the pricier appliance package, which cost about $8k.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s such an incredible feeling to transform a space into exactly what you want and what you need. We’ve never experienced that before. We now understand the appeal. Amazing! At home! It was worth every penny.</span></p>

			<h2 class="p1">City dwellers overcome space limitations and make room for the luxurious amenity</h2>
<h2><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27227 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="Image of a wine fridge under the stairs" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h2>
<h3>Enjoy entertaining in large or small spaces</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wine fridges make a modern, functional addition to any kitchen. For wine enthusiasts and party throwers, adding a wine fridge serves up the beverage at just the right temperature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily for apartment dwellers, small wine fridges are available to accommodate even the slightest square footage. Here, Sweeten renovators worked on creative solutions with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their general contractors</a>. They can be located in small kitchen peninsulas and even under the stairs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">A small wine fridge enhances loft living</h3>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="Kitchen with marble island and bar seating" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56294" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Lia and Chris needed to incorporate a kitchen that felt organic in their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industrial open loft space</a>. Their Sweeten contractor did just that and built a seamless space connected to the living room. It turned out “we underestimated the significance of overall design in renovating,” the couple said. The overall layout included a longer peninsula with a small wine fridge. &#8220;This felt like a low-cost, high-impact amenity you don’t typically get in the city and we were very excited about it,” the couple said. It faced the living area for an easy transition from the kitchen.</p>
<h3>The perfect gathering point</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42805 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-6.jpg" alt="Image of a wine fridge in kitchen peninsula" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-6.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-6-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a chef/caterer, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten homeowner Arnish</span> wanted to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/chef-remodels-belltell-loft-kitchen-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovate his kitchen</a> to better accommodate his large parties and cooking activities. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen peninsula became the centerpiece of the room and a gathering point for guests. Arnish added a wine fridge to the peninsula, to elevate its look and function. Now all of his entertaining needs are in one location, conveniently close by for guest refills.  </span></p>
<h3>A built-in wine fridge cabinet</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="taupe-kitchen-cabinets-and-tile-flooring" class="alignnone wp-image-38896 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Julie-Marcuse-Apt-24.gif" alt="taupe kitchen cabinets and tile flooring and white countertop after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a water leak forced </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/central-park-west-co-op-renovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">these Manhattan homeowners </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">into an entire apartment gut renovation, they used the opportunity to create more modern and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">useful storage options.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One of the best remodel additions: their kitchen cabinet wine fridge. To avoid an overcrowded main fridge, they added a small, secondary unit to optimize the space. A cabinet panel on the wine fridge door matches the rest of the kitchen cabinets for a sleek, modern finish. </span></p>
<h3>Turning unused nooks into beverage storage space</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28280 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-15-2.jpg" alt="Image of a small wine fridge in kitchen nook" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-15-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-15-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-15-2-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-15-2-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main goals of Sarah and Craig&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/queens-condo-overhaul-begins-with-kitchen-sink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Long Island City condo renovation</a> was to maximize areas that had been previously dead space. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they worked to reconfigure the storage of their kitchen, they discovered a small nook of unused space in their bar area. The installation of their wine fridge improved the kitchen&#8217;s design and functionality. </span></p>
<h3>A family-friendly beverage fridge</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36121 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-16.jpg" alt="Image of a wine fridge with double-sided doors" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-16-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-16-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten homeowners Courtney and Jim</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> renovated their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton Hill home</a> that had become overcrowded for their family of four. It lacked practical storage options and needed a more personalized feel. They focused on the kitchen, where they gather as a family and for socializing. To increase the hosting potential of their kitchen, their newly installed under-counter wine fridge would serve as a beverage center for children and adults. </span></p>
<h3>A creative wine fridge location</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27227 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="Image of a wine fridge under the stairs" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alicia and Ed</span>&#8216;s<span style="font-weight: 400;"> <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brownstone remodel</a> aimed to boost their kitchen&#8217;s &#8220;wow&#8221; factor. They were especially frustrated with their old refrigerator&#8217;s lack of storage space for wine bottles. The couple&#8217;s Sweeten contractor found them the perfect solution. Although their floor plan did not allow for a larger refrigerator, they found a spot underneath the staircase. No structural changes were needed. A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chalkboard wall</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">surrounds their wine fridge for a unique touch. </span></p>
<h3>A kitchen designed for foodies</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42022 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-10.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen with a small wine fridge in corner" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-professed foodies, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica and Jesse</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> set out to build a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/when-foodies-renovate-kitchen-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working kitchen</a> for cooking and gathering together. Their Sweeten contractor created a six-foot peninsula that was a true workhorse. It featured <span class="s1">full-length drawers for pans and dinnerware, built-in shelves for cookbooks, and toe-level kick-drawers. Utilizing every inch, the couple also fit in a built-in wine fridge. </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They now have complete control over the temperature of their wine, and can easily serve beverages with their meals.</span></p>
<h3>A snug fit for a small wine fridge</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41408 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Kayla-Taylor-KitchenBath-04.jpg" alt="Image of white kitchen cabinets with a wine refrigerator" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Kayla-Taylor-KitchenBath-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Kayla-Taylor-KitchenBath-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Kayla-Taylor-KitchenBath-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayla and Jesse</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it was time to remodel their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/one-bedroom-renovation-chelsea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70-square-foot kitchen</a> for a more personal feel. By working with her Sweeten contractor, Kayla was able to find space for everything she wanted in her new kitchen. One of the best pieces that she was able to add was a small wine fridge. Without compromising any necessary space or overcrowding the kitchen, Kayla was able to fit a small unit in her kitchen. As an avid cook, the wine fridge completed her dream kitchen. </span></p>

			<h2>4 ways to renovate for an entertainment kitchen that&#8217;ll help gatherings go smoothly</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41135 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Image of a New Jersey kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>If you love to entertain, you&#8217;ll look at your living spaces for optimal flow and comfort. Whether<span style="font-weight: 400;"> putting together a gathering, large or small, and in any season, your space needs to be functional and efficient. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the kitchen is the main hub for entertaining, a few changes can get your space soiree-ready. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we look at recent Sweeten kitchen renovations that keep homeowners entertainment-ready. Organized pantries, a peninsula or island for workspace, or removing walls so that everyone is brought in on the action are just a few ideas.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>Parties are made possible by pantries</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any chef will tell you, you should always keep some basic culinary staples in the house. Even a simple stash allows you to throw together a last-minute dinner party. But storing these must-have ingredients (think stocks, spices, and starches) means freeing up space in your kitchen. That’s where a well-designed pantry comes in! These pantries are also clutch even if you have a longer time to plan a party, since they can be used to store your serving dishes and other accouterments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-kitchen-cabinets-large-kitchen" class="alignnone wp-image-50510 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled.jpg" alt="gray kitchen cabinets in a large kitchen with white countertop and large pantry shelf after renovation" width="2560" height="1707" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the case for Sweeten homeowners </span> Nilda and Brian <span style="font-weight: 400;">. They chose shallower cabinets but a wider pantry unit. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won’t lose anything in the back and can save the money by not adding the mechanical pullouts you would need for deep pantries,” says Nilda.</span></p>
<h3>Open-concept equals open house</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a large space to host is a homeowner&#8217;s dream. However, many spaces don’t start out open and airy, especially if your home or apartment is older. But by taking down a wall or even just part of it, you can make your kitchen more inviting and comfortable for guests when entertaining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45624 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="Image of an open concept kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montclair, New Jersey, couple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (<em>above</em>) turned to Sweeten to help turn their “old” kitchen into a more livable space—with room for entertaining. They tore down two walls, including the wall between the dining room and kitchen to create an open concept. Plus, they also found enough space for an island counter—a double win for entertaining! </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/edgewater-new-jersey-kitchen-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="large-window-in-dining" class="alignnone wp-image-41291 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="large window in the dining area and kitchen island with pendant lights and picture frame molding on walls and tile flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/edgewater-new-jersey-kitchen-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer and Joe’s New Jersey kitchen renovation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Sweeten also included a redesign of their kitchen layout. They asked their </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contractor to knock down a wall to get better sightlines to the wall of windows in their living room. Unfortunately, the entire wall could not be removed as it was load-bearing. So their contractor took down as much of the wall as possible but was still able to make a space that is great for entertaining.</span></p>
<h3>Kitchen islands provide staging space</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating a center island in kitchen design has long been popular, and for good reason! Kitchen islands provide a large meal prep area, as well as space for guests to gather around. Kitchen islands are great for storage, too. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/moroccan-tile-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten homeowner and frequent party host, Dawn,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included a center island in her recent kitchen remodel for exactly these reasons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33844 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="Image of a large peninsula in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">People like to congregate in the kitchen when they arrive. I wanted to have a space that didn’t interfere with the process of making dinner,” says Dawn (<em>above</em>). “With a much bigger peninsula, we confine the prep/cooking work to one half of the surface while making room for an attractive presentation on the other.”</span></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/west-village-nyc-condo-renovation-nyc-enters-new-century/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neil and Ilene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also wanted a kitchen island included in their Sweeten renovation plans. It was important to “make smarter use of the space…and be flexible for when their children and grandchildren visit.” Mission accomplished.</span></p>
<h3>Get the appropriate appliances</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48923 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01.jpg" alt="Image of a small entertainment kitchen" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When renovating, you have to divide your must-have vs. your nice-to-have design elements. And, if you love entertaining, you know it’s all about the food. Even though their kitchen was only 70-square-feet, Sweeten homeowners and avid cooks </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/one-bedroom-renovation-chelsea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayla and Jesse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (<em>above</em>) made it their focus to include full-size appliances. That meant a 30-inch stove, a large refrigerator,<em> and</em> a dishwasher. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After much finagling, we found a layout that allowed for everything I wanted and more (somehow, I even fit a wine fridge),” says Kayla. With their new entertainment kitchen, the couple can create their favorite dishes for friends and family more easily.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44787 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="Image of a chef-friendly galley kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel and Kate,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also avid cooks, wanted a chef-friendly redesign for their galley kitchen. But unlike a lot of homeowners, they wanted to keep the layout. Daniel considers the galley configuration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a residential approximation of a commercial restaurant line. Rather than lamenting its limits, he saw it as a pro’s set-up. Wherever you’re standing, everything is within reach!</span></p>

<h3>Learning to navigate a New York renovation</h3>
<p>A first—and obvious—lesson in renovating: it really is harder in New York. When my husband Chris and I embarked on this adventure, we thought we knew what we were doing. After all, we’d undertaken a remodel of our 1914 Seattle condo before. But that was all before we decamped to New York for work—and learned what a reno here really takes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our real estate agent brought us to a 1929 building we would have never come to on our own, smack next to the construction zone that is Hudson Yards. I was hesitant, but Chris saw a decent amount of space and a good layout in a developing neighborhood.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After moving in, we wanted to redo the kitchen, but the most urgent fix was the bathroom. An old leak from above had unmoored a section of tile, and the previous owner refused to repair it as a condition of closing. This was our first lesson in how different a Seattle and New York renovation could be.</span></p>
<h3>Deciding to do the larger renovation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our foray into a standalone bathroom remodel ended early—we got as far as finishing the design when the co-op came back with a series of unexpected plumbing requirements, chock full of things we’d never heard of like water hammer arrestors and Laticrete. The price nearly doubled, and if we were going to spend much more on a remodel, we decided we should save up and do the larger apartment renovation we had hoped to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regular re-spackling, we figured we could buy time while we saved up. That folly ended a year and a half later when, hours before leaving for vacation, a precarious section of tile came crashing down. Our super covered the crumbling wall with a plastic tarp, but it was clear: it was time to begin bidding.</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">&#8230;we raided a savings account and scrambled to add herringbone floors to the scope. The late choice delayed the project by a month, but it was one of the best decisions we made.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Finding the right general contractor with multiple skills</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We weren’t sure exactly what we needed—walls weren’t moving, but our co-op required an architect. So while we asked the initial bathroom contractor to bid, we also thankfully posted our project on Sweeten. To complete our renovation, Sweeten paired us with a design-build firm with architecture training. They also did custom millwork, making it the perfect fit for our project. Not only did the general contractor immediately understand our aesthetic, but we also had a great rapport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="lead-gray-kitchen-cabinet-hardwood-floor" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48627" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-21.gif" alt="Lead gray kitchen cabinet and open refrigerator and hardwood floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In planning the remodel, we knew we wanted to play off the building’s modest Art Deco bones, but in a way that wasn’t slavish or theme-y. We also both brought mild obsessions to the mix—for me, an inexplicable passion for English cabinetry, for Chris, a desire to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">put a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/banquettes-seating-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kitchen banquette</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in every possible corner.</span></p>
<h3>Reworking the kitchen layout</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first big choice was how to manage the kitchen layout. The room was spacious enough—designed as an eat-in when 24” of counter space seemed ample—but the two doorways weren’t in an ideal location. One opened onto the foyer and the other onto a back hallway by the bedroom. It had also been poorly updated in the intervening years: half of the footprint was wasted, with a lonely refrigerator in one corner and an errant desk in another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-kitchen-cabinets-wood-floor" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48614" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08.jpg" alt="Custom gray kitchen cabinets on dark oak wood flooring and foyer with bookcase after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location of the gas riser dashed our hopes of moving the entry to adjoin the living room, so our contractor suggested closing the smaller opening to create a wide galley with room for a banquette. This would extend the cabinetry the length of the room on one side, doubling the counter space and creating room for a wine fridge and pantry to boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we played with centering the sink and range on the counter runs, our Sweeten contractor advised against it to preserve prep space. In hindsight, we were happy to have lived in the space before renovating: symmetry looked better on paper, but from experience cooking in the space, we knew her recommendation would be more functional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep the room from feeling enclosed, we substituted upper cabinets for extra-long open shelves on one side, then tucked in under-cabinet lighting for function. The banquette capped off the space, creating both more storage and a place for friends to hang out while cooking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-foyer-full-length bookcase" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48609 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03.jpg" alt="Gray foyer with full length bookcase and brown wood floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Giving the foyer a purpose </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our foyer situation was a classic New York City conundrum: too small to do much of anything useful but large enough to be wasted if empty. We decided on a full-height bookcase that’s only 8” deep and it holds loads more than we expected. On the opposite side, our general contractor fitted narrow custom cabinets to serve as a bar. There’s just enough depth to squeeze in double rows of liquor bottles and glasses, saving precious room in the kitchen. We ran new electrical to hang art lights over tall mirrors—the goal was to make the whole space pull triple duty as an entryway, a library, and a bar—then painted the foyer and kitchen cabinetry the same deep gray so that the two spaces relate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="black-ceiling-white-subway-tiles" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48619 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13.jpg" alt="Black ceiling with white subway tiles in bathroom with white tub and shower glass and white hex floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">A renewed bathroom in classic black-and-white</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n the bathroom, we preserved and refinished an original tub and stuck to a classic black-and-white New York-inspired scheme with updated finishes. Given the narrow layout, the primary play here would be with subtle geometries—and taking advantage of our building’s extra thick walls. A hex marble floor worked well with the warmer white subway tile and porcelain. Our contractor recommended extending the floor tile onto the base of the walls to stretch the visual plane of the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hexagon echoed in new shower controls that help tame the notorious temperature fluctuations that come with living in an old building. In such a small space, we took a cue from hotel bathrooms and put a pedestal sink atop console legs to keep the space open. An extra-tall recessed medicine cabinet provides both storage and electrical outlets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favorite thing of all is the towel warmer which took forever to source but that I deeply love for its hex bars and Anglophilic appeal. The contractor placed it in a deep niche so that the warm rails wouldn’t risk singeing passersby. We decided to paint the walls and ceiling in a black high sheen that makes the ceiling recede and the white surfaces gleam. Strangely, of all the things in the apartment, the shower glass proved one of the most frustrating: it wasn’t installed until five months after everything else wrapped up.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Finding the budget for hardwood floors</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New wood floors were the most unexpected part of the reno. We had only budgeted for the kitchen alone. But the more floor options we looked at—and after our contractor dissuaded us from several temptations like Moroccan Bejmat tile—the more we wanted hardwood in the kitchen. That meant either putting down maple boards to match the rest of the apartment—despite disliking their color—or redoing everything. Our contractor’s opinion was that changing the kitchen floors would make one of the biggest impacts in the space. So a month into the renovation, after all the other demo was done, we raided a savings account and scrambled to add herringbone floors to the scope. The late choice delayed the project by a month, but it was one of the best decisions we made.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Becoming comfortable with flexibility </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stepping back from it now, our major lesson was in developing a deep comfort with flexibility. We found that we could be much more controlling of our remodel in Seattle than here. New York’s interminable series of permits, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-op requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and engineering reports—paired with the inelasticity of old spaces—meant we had to take a go-with-the-flow approach that made trust and an ability to laugh key. Also, best to know exactly what you’re looking for before you start to remodel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our contractor taught us the biggest lesson of all: do it all at once if you can. It’s not the disruption that’s the problem, really, or that rework ends up costing more—it’s that few of us really have the talent to create a cohesive space in small increments. Unfortunately, we didn’t quite learn this last lesson in time. During our reno, our bedroom became the storage unit for our furniture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than anything else, we were lucky to have a real partnership with our Sweeten general contractor to see us through the changes and warn us off of bad choices. We feel a bit like we’ve earned our honorary New Yorker stripes: we chose a space that we thought was a diamond in the rough and hoped we could turn it into a classic city respite. We feel like—at least to our taste—we got there, and now we have this lovely, large-living one-bedroom to come home to in one of the most dynamic parts of Manhattan.</span></p>

<h3>Wrestling with the idea of renovating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We moved to Clinton Hill over a decade ago, and always loved the neighborhood with its history of housing for returning servicemen who worked in the Navy Yard. On a total whim, we went to an open house in the Clinton Hill Co-ops and made an offer on the first apartment we saw: an 800-square-foot, one-bedroom that had been converted into a junior two-bedroom.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was frighteningly familiar with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span class="s2">Clinton Hill Co-op section</span></a> of the Sweeten website. Our neighbor also used <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to renovate her kitchen, and it looked fantastic. It seemed like a simple concept, but Jim and I were just completely overwhelmed with the idea of a renovation. Because our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment</a> really felt like it was falling down around us, we knew that we would need to change almost everything.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to look for a place upstate, hoping that more room and a home for weekend getaways would help alleviate the stress of our overcrowded and dark apartment. We made an offer on a house, had it approved, started to negotiate, and realized we needed to feel good in our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary residence</a> before we took on a second space.</p>

<h3>Finding our general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We headed straight to </span>Sweeten<span style="text-align: justify;">, were <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with three general contractors</a> right away, and within a week </span>picked our contractor<span style="text-align: justify;">. He was incredibly responsive and patient with us as we walked through our apartment over and over again, thinking about the best way to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open our kitchen</a>, update the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>, reconfigure our bedroom, shore up our pockmarked walls and ceiling, refinish our floors, and add storage everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We were absolutely giddy with the concept of overhead lighting! We were wired for several fixtures in the living room and kitchen, as well as recessed lights in the hallways and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. Because our apartment had been dark and crowded for so long, we gravitated toward a simple, minimalist design with white and gray paint to brighten the space and give it a clean look.</span></p>
<h3>Personalizing the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim grew up with visions of a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> island where everyone could gather</a> to eat and socialize–that became our only non-negotiable. It helped us focus our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning on the kitchen first</a>. We knew we wanted custom cabinets, so our contractor brought in his cabinet maker to meet with us and walk through the layout.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Within a week, they had sent us a 3D rendering of our new kitchen, with Jim’s dream island, plus an extended butcher block counter ideal for our boys to sit and finish homework while we cook. Our contractor suggested the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sophisticated-chalkboard-paint-ideas-4582330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chalkboard paint—now a huge hit with the kids</a>. He created a lot of extra storage under the island, including drawers for our pots and pans, plus a pantry along the extended counter. We have a dishwasher for the first time ever and love the kitchen tile.</p>

<h3>Storage reimagined</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor had the genius idea to extend our bedroom two feet into the living room, which allowed him to build a closet (we used to store our clothes in the boys’ room). It was worth the minimal loss of space to gain more storage. We also hired a closet company to build a shoe closet for us. Since our room has two windows, we decided on an <span>opaque</span> glass door to maintain some privacy, but also take advantage of the natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, kids' bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36112 " srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Our contractor came through on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the boys&#8217;<span style="color: #333333;"> bedroom</span>, our only <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directive was storage</a>, storage, storage. We wanted to find a way to keep all of their things in the bedroom, instead of spilling out into our common living areas. Once again, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our contractor came through</a> on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room, ensuring we lost very little floor space. We’re not falling all over stuff anymore!</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36200 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-13-1.gif" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, custom closets, kids' bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></h3>
<p>In the <span style="color: #333333;">bathroom</span>, we needed to keep a bathtub because we have young boys, and I insisted on a large piece of custom glass as our partial shower door. He warned me it might be difficult to reach around for the water control, but I insisted. It looks lovely, but he was right—it’s a bit of a struggle to help with bathtime.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, bathroom, shower, toilet, home, design" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36116 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Moving out during the renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our biggest challenge was realizing that, because we were <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating the entire space</a>, we would have to move out for an extended period of time. We didn’t initially budget to live somewhere else, so the added cost was a bit of a shock. After three months, we were scheduled to move back in and had left the rental, when our contractor told us he was about a week behind. Much of this delay was due to some delayed deliveries of things I had ordered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had no place to go and had to live in the apartment while there were still tools and supplies everywhere, with no appliances or kitchen counters. It was a bit uncomfortable, but not unmanageable. In hindsight, we probably should have just booked the rental for an extra week as insurance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with Sweeten made us wonder what we had waited for. We were matched so quickly with a contractor, we were able to use the website to see examples of his work, we could reach out with questions and concerns. Another upside was the Sweeten blog, a huge source of inspiration! Our new apartment is <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exactly what we had hoped for</a>: simple, comfortable, bright, and uncluttered. It feels like home.</p>

Their white-glove apartment was submerged under several inches of water—the result of a leak in an apartment several floors above.</p>

Jean visited and saw the damage, plus what remained of an impressive art collection—amassed over a lifetime of travels, including Picassos and ancient sculptures. The scope of work was to include not only the kitchen, where the leak began, but<span style="color: #333333;"> also other parts of the apartment, including the adjacent hallway pantry, laundry room, guest room and bath, and the formal dining room. Eventually, the homeowners decided to convert their now-grown son’s bedroom into a study, and their daughter&#8217;s former room into a lounge/exercise space.</span></p>

<blockquote><p>They sent us three contractors to interview, which was a huge relief. I’m doing this for the first time, and I was totally out of my comfort zone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their Sweeten contractor gutted all of the floors, walls, and ceilings and then began the work of restoration. The couple was interested in restoring what was previously there while bringing a freshness and openness to space by choosing new materials and finishes. The kitchen, which had sported a stainless steel backsplash, outdated cabinets, and inadequate lighting, was given a makeover that included custom gray cabinets paired with white quartz countertops and a unique amazonite backsplash.<span style="color: #333333;"> The homeowner explained, &#8220;We visited the stone yard with the contractor and marked the piece out. We wanted it bookended and to come together in an inverted V over the sink.&#8221; This was done over both the sink in the walk-through pantry as well as the main kitchen space.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Julie-Marcuse-Apt-24.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38896 size-full" title="taupe-kitchen-cabinets-and-tile-flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Julie-Marcuse-Apt-24.gif" alt="taupe kitchen cabinets and tile flooring and white countertop after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" /></a>New pendants were added to light up the breakfast table, where the duo generally eats all their meals unless they are entertaining a larger group. “If we want to have more people over, we use the dining room, but otherwise we eat in the kitchen,” the homeowner said. Both the oval-shaped table and radiator cover were designed by the homeowners which their contractors commissioned to have made. Useful storage solutions were added including a dedicated spice drawer and a movable cart outfitted with a cutting board that can be moved wherever needed.</p>
<p>Additionally, the refrigerator was relocated from the hallway pantry area to the main kitchen space, which made it much easier to access, and a smaller, secondary refrigerator was added instead. “I’m a big condiments person, so we made sure to add room for them,” the homeowner said.</p>

It includes works on paper and canvas; bronze and wood sculpture, ceramics and ceremonial objects. The hope was that the renovation would open up sufficient space and light to showcase these many objects of beauty and turned out to be one of the most gratifying aspects of the renovation.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">In what had been their now-grown daughter&#8217;s bedroom, the homeowners envisioned a serene and comforting space for lounging as well as exercise. The walls were painted lavender, inspired by an acrylic and paper painting that had been done by a friend. This was a theme throughout their home: &#8220;We wanted to give the artwork room to breathe, and to be the inspiration for the color palette in each room.&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #333333;">Concurrently, they also decided to replace all of their landmarked windows. This alone took 3-4 weeks, and the Sweeten contractor had to make sure to protect the built-ins and previous renovation work. He also topped</span> </span><span class="s1">all of the windowsills with Caesarstone.</span></p>
<p>The homeowners are so happy to be back in their apartment, after pushing through<span style="color: #333333;"> over </span>two years of negotiations, paperwork, and red tape—not to mention mold, dust, and debris in every corner of their home. ”You come to realize, what one person thinks is a good job is not what another person might consider a good job,” the homeowner said. “Sweeten was so supportive. They called periodically when we were getting very disheartened. They sent us three contractors to interview, which was a huge relief. I’m doing this for the first time, and I was totally out of my comfort zone. We had no idea how to pick people—so Sweeten was incredibly helpful.”</p>
<p>They report that even though they felt like giving up on many occasions, they persevered. What seems like courage is really having &#8220;no choice&#8221;. This was their home. We were happy to hear that the best part of the whole situation was their Sweeten contractor, who delivered what he promised and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Big personality comes home with a trough sink and a wine fridge—under the stairs</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27222 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Homeowners Ed and Alicia with their dog, Roxy" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After Roxy, a rescued Rhodesian ridgeback, joined their household, Alicia and Ed realized “a little more space in a laid-back neighborhood” would be a better fit for the family of three than Manhattan, where they were currently living. They set their sights on a 1,400-square-foot garden duplex in a Park Slope brownstone. They fell in love with the building, which had been converted to condos by a developer about a decade ago. Despite the high-end finishes that were chosen at that time, there were issues that had developed in the interim. The couple also wanted to bring the renovations in line with their tastes, and in a style more befitting a building dating from the turn of the last century. As Alicia put it, “We really just wanted to make the place something we loved coming home to at the end of each day. What we had wasn’t awful, but it wasn’t terribly practical either<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>we had mismatched countertops, cracked tiles in the bathroom, a lack of counter space in the master bath, and most importantly, no space in the fridge to store our wine. The place just lacked the ‘wow’ you would expect from a building this pretty.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Before-Watermarked.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27245 size-chrono" title="before: kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Before-Watermarked-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27226 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27224 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached out to Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors—for <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a>. For the couple&#8217;s custom kitchen renovation, Christina, their Sweeten Planner, was present at regular site visits and contractor meetings, providing detailed progress reports. Initially, the couple intended to focus their time and money on the kitchen. Instead, they also updated the guest and master bathrooms executing an overall vision<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>“a muted, classic design with a modern twist.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, this meant replacing the mismatched countertops as well as the cabinet fronts, and creatively finding space for a built-in wine fridge. Ed and Alicia knew that when the kitchen was renovated a decade ago the developer had used top-of-the-line materials, from custom Italian cabinetry to Viking, Miele, and Liebherr appliances; the space didn’t need a gut, simply a refresh. The downside of the custom Italian kitchen, however, was that none of the cabinetry was standard-sized. Refacing was a custom job, pushing out timelines, but it meant they could keep all the existing built-in shelving and customized organization that would have been extremely expensive to replace. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Countertops</a> resembling marble from Caesarstone unified the space and were chosen for their hardiness and durability. Ed had always wanted waterfall-edge countertops, which completed the look perfectly.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27225 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27227 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Chalkboard wall and wine fridge under the stairs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They had hoped to replace a smaller-than-usual refrigerator, as well as add a wine fridge. But the floor plan wouldn’t afford them the space for a larger unit, so they focused on adding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wine fridge</a> instead. Working with their Sweeten contractor, Ed and Alicia poked exploratory holes in the drywall underneath their stairs. Happily, they discovered that a 36-bottle dual zone wine fridge would fit in the space without making any structural changes. “It&#8217;s a luxury you would never think you could have in New York. We painted the surrounding wall with chalkboard paint<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>it’s a great way to leave notes for each other, plan out our grocery list, and try out some amateur artwork,” they said. &#8220;As a bonus, we found the current kitchen fridge is more than large enough for our needs.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The downstairs bathroom was next on the list<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>it already had a great soaking tub, but the vanity and medicine cabinet were outdated. The tiles, too, were showing their age. Alicia had always loved the feel of a traditional New York City bathroom<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>penny tile floors, subway tile, and a classic black-and-white color palette. They replaced the sink with a trough style: “There was debate whether the sink would be too large, but after lots of measuring and imagining how close it would be to someone using the shower or toilet, we decided to do it. We are so glad we did. It is a perfect fit. We also went for the matching faucets and soap dish.” Having forgone <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> under the new sink, they added a small shelf and a 1940s American Red Cross medicine cabinet (found online in Bulgaria!). The large closet just outside of the bathroom made up for the limited storage. Lastly, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-hung-toilets-look-behind-scenes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall-hung toilet</a> was a lot of trouble to install, but ultimately worth the effort, since it’s incredibly easy to keep clean and makes the room feel larger.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">During the renovation of the downstairs bath, the contractor discovered that there was preserved exposed brick along one wall. They hoped that the brick was in the same condition a few feet away in the living room, and asked the contractor to rip down the sheetrock where their dining table would sit. “It turns out we were in luck. The brick looked wonderful, and though we had to unexpectedly reroute some electrical cables and find matching oak to patch up the flooring, it was worth all of the expense and impact on the timeline.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the couple also decided to renovate the master bathroom upstairs. (One of the pluses of living through your renovation is that you can figure out what else needs work while the contractor is on-site!) Since Alicia and Ed moved in while the renovation was still ongoing, they lived with the space for a while and found the bath to be unsuitable in many ways. “The overhead lighting was terrible, and the illuminated mirror died the day after we closed on the apartment. There was the complete lack of shelf space for us to set things down while getting ready, and the leaking pipework rendered the vanity useless for storage. The space really felt unloved.&#8221; To give the room a facelift without breaking the budget, they kept the large soaking tub (same as the one downstairs), the flooring, and toilet. A new white shaker vanity with a marble countertop provided ample storage while an illuminated medicine cabinet and built-in LED lights lit up the room. Adding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass panel</a> in place of the old shower curtain opened the space up. Lastly, a herringbone wallpaper from Ferm Living took the master bath to the next level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They made the home “<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-appliances-worth-hype/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smarter</a>,” by adding outlets in convenient locations for their <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sonos</a> sound system, converting regular to USB outlets where appropriate, adding a video intercom, and installing a full <a href="https://nest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nest</a> thermostat and smoke detector system. Now, they can control the temperature via Amazon Echo (thanks, Alexa!) and ensure that the apartment is a comfortable temperature for Roxy while they are away.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Stairs-During.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27241 mb-0 size-chrono" title="during: Roxy on the stairs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Stairs-During-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="During" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although they’d hoped to finish the renovations prior to their move-in date, they ended up <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living through the entire renovation</a>, which lasted four weeks from beginning to end. The toughest part, according to Alicia and Ed, was keeping Roxy out of trouble. (See above.) Their advice to future renovators? “Find a contractor you trust, and take their advice on what things would work well and what to avoid. We used tools like Pinterest, the Sweeten blog, and other online tools to get ideas. Also, if you have space, try to keep some spare materials once you have completed your renovation. We spent a long time trying to find a flooring that matched our current style to patch in around the exposed brick wall. We decided to buy an extra pack this time and store it in our basement in case of emergency. The same thing with all the tile. You never know what could happen in the future<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>for a few hundred dollars, it is worth the investment and peace of mind!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">From open shelves to a liquor cabinet with a garage-style door, these storage ideas can transform your kitchen (or closet!) into a fabulous home bar</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" title="white kitchen-recessed-lights"  class="alignnone wp-image-22989 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg" alt="white kitchen with recessed lights and white cabinets along with white door and knob after renovation" width="723" height="481" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When friends come over, the first thing you do is offer them a glass of wine. That means locating the bottle of wine before heading to where the glasses are usually stored. Finally, you root through the silverware and odds-and-ends drawers until you triumphantly unearth the corkscrew. Sound familiar? Rather than storing bar essentials around the kitchen, these Sweeten homeowners opted for home bar solutions to store everything from glasses to bottles of wine, liquor, cocktail shakers, and more. Plus, homeowners Yi Tyng and Maxime even transformed a closet located directly across from their kitchen into a wine bar (and it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/the-closet-as-workspace-bedroom-or-bar.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured in <em>The New York Times</em></a>). We’ll drink to that!</span></p>
<h3>Got an empty shelf niche? Add home bar hardware to keep stemware closeby</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22998 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-04" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/holly-kitchen-bath-renovation-greenwich-village/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holly and Christian’s</a> kitchen in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This clever use of niche shelf space is an excellent way to store wine, cocktail, and champagne glasses so that they can dry quickly and always be within reach for a celebratory toast.</span></p>
<h3>Floating shelves showcase stemware and spirits</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22996 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan and Mike’s</a> kitchen in Hell’s Kitchen, Manhattan.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Balancing a run of lower cabinets, a few open shelves act as a home bar dedicated to glassware and bar favorites make it easy to whip up drinks for company. And why not make it a home for cookbooks and cocktail recipes, too?</span></p>
<h3>Using slivers of cabinet space for bottle storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LKR_2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22990 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LKR_2-723x1089.jpg" alt="LKR_2" width="723" height="1089" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisa’s</a> kitchen in Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you have wine, one popular way to store the bottles is on their side so that the corks don’t dry out and let air in. A custom nook with grooved edges is the perfect solution.</span></p>
<h3>Stacking shelves above a wine fridge creates a home bar nook</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23118 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22" width="723" height="482" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frans and Dalal&#8217;s</a> studio kitchen in Gramercy Park, Manhattan.</p>
<p class="p1">Every inch in a studio apartment should be utilized to its full potential. By using the placement of the wine fridge as the base for a custom bar, these homeowners were able to add a countertop and shelving to store their home bar essentials and glassware in one easy-to-locate spot.</p>
<h3 class="p1">A cupboard under the stairs becomes space for spirits<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN-Wine-Bar.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23074 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN-Wine-Bar-723x964.jpg" alt="SWEETEN-Wine-Bar" width="723" height="964" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yi Tyng and Maxime&#8217;s</a> wine bar closet on the Upper West Side, Manhattan.</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">This closet, located under the stairs and directly across from the homeowners&#8217; galley kitchen, was transformed into a wine (and espresso) bar complete with open shelving, a wine fridge, and a counter with bar stools. The space also doubles as a breakfast nook.</p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">A garage-style door cleverly conceals cocktail-making gear<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" title="white kitchen-recessed-lights"  class="alignnone wp-image-22989 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg" alt="white kitchen with recessed lights and white cabinets along with white door and knob after renovation" width="723" height="481" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have a larger collection, a custom bar cabinet with shelving for glassware and bottles can keep everything neatly organized. This one also boasts a sliding garage-style door so you can choose whether or not to display the goods based on your mood.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Carroll Gardens homeowner Kim Solop </span></i></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After ten years of living in our Carroll Gardens condo, we really needed a change. We contemplated a move to the suburbs or upgrading to a bigger place in a less popular Brooklyn neighborhood. After almost a year of looking and being priced out in our current neighborhood, we decided to renovate our current place, a two-bed, two-bath, 1,200 square-foot condo that we bought in 2006. We loved our current neighborhood with its proximity to our workplaces, lots of cute restaurants, shops, and our two sons’ schools. The problems were in the apartment itself: I was unhappy with the dark kitchen—I always had been. I love taking baths but hated the jet tub that was installed over a decade ago. Lastly, our laundry closet had a lot of wasted space and I wanted to add a walk-in pantry!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a big fan of home decor blogs, I had been stalking the Sweeten site for a while, and really loved seeing the transformations that the contractors could do with space. I was excited for the chance to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/15462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our renovation</a>. I met with a couple of them, and decided on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>. I really clicked with the project managers and could see that we would have a good partnership.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My main objective for the kitchen was to brighten it up and eliminate the space between the cabinets and the ceiling. I hated how this wasted space looked and the amount of dust it collected. After a few weeks of sourcing materials, we were ready to go! I knew from the get-go that I wanted a white kitchen, as well as shaker-style cabinets with quartz countertops that were marble look-alikes. Other than that, I was pretty open to ideas. Our contractor came over with a wealth of ideas for how we could open the kitchen up to maximize light. (Unfortunately, there are no windows in the kitchen, so there was only so much we could do.) I debated another set of cabinets on top of the current ones, but eventually decided against it. I switched gears a bit on the white color palette, choosing instead a dual-tone kitchen with white uppers and gray lower cabinets. After living with long pulls, I decided to go with smaller handles on all the cabinetry. Quartz countertops were also a must, for the durability factor! With two kids and a husband who are not always the neatest, I knew that we needed a tough work surface. I was adamant about getting a wine fridge. As members of a few wine clubs, we struggled to find space to keep our wine at the right temperatures.</p>

<p>Our microwave above the range was replaced with a microwave drawer, and a hood was installed above the stovetop instead. With the new wine fridge taking up precious cabinet space, I did lose a place for pots and pans. Our contractor was able to give me deep drawers in the pantry to make up for this lost storage. My other kitchen must-haves were a deep, white porcelain sink, and an under-counter pull-out garbage can.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22809 mb-24 size-chrono" title="brooklyn renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22812 size-large" title="Brooklyn renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN-Kimberly-Pantry.gif" alt="SWEETEN-Kimberly-Pantry" width="600" height="900" /></p>
<p>Across the kitchen was a room that held just the washer and dryer with inaccessible space that was wasted. When we extended the wall, there was room for a customized pantry with countertops, shelving, and cabinetry that matched the kitchen. After not having a pantry for so long, it’s amazing to have one, and the additional space has really been a lifesaver. I had envisioned barn doors, but there was not enough wall space for it. The double doors we ended up hanging looked so plain and boring. I had some wallpaper left over from the hallway&#8211;so I went for it and covered the doors too. I think it turned out nicely.</p>

<p>For the bathroom, I wanted a totally new look that was modern and clean. We went with dark floors, a deep soaking tub, and a floating vanity. Our contractor showed me a picture of another bathroom he did, and I loved it so much, we copied it almost exactly. It came out perfectly and I am fighting my older son almost daily for baths! The tub is divine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We actually lived in the space during the whole renovation, which lasted about seven weeks. It was definitely challenging and required a lot of patience. The contractor and his crew were great about cleaning up, however, and we made the best of it with lots of takeout dinners.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading the Sweeten blog for so many years, it was exciting to embark on my own renovation. I realized that renovating is messy and dirty, and almost always takes longer than you had originally anticipated. You learn to roll with the punches, and realize that things happen. We had a few hiccups along the way, such as wanting the barn door on the pantry that wasn’t going to work, so I learned to compromise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoyed working with our Sweeten contractor,  who made himself available at all hours. He was in constant communication and has remained a friend to this day. We love our new kitchen and other improvements, and are planning on staying to enjoy them for many years to come!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><em>When Amanda and her husband set out to upgrade from their two-bedroom Windsor Terrace apartment in Brooklyn, they had a few adjectives in mind—light, airy, warm. They loved the neighborhood as well as the great light in their rental, but as work-from-home writers, desired larger bedrooms and a more spacious kitchen. They had also just gotten married, and if you’ve ever had a registry, you understand why they needed more kitchen storage! Here’s the story of how a visit with friends led them to a new home, and how an irresistible pattern sparked their kitchen design.</em></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22363 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-723x565.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="565" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-723x565.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-300x235.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-600x469.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Amanda’s initial intention was to stay in Windsor Terrace, the direction of her apartment search changed when she and her husband visited some friends at their new home in the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a> (CHC). They loved the feel of the complex and the apartment space itself, and realized that this was where they wanted to be. After a few months of checking out CHC listings as they came on the market, the couple landed a two-bedroom, one-bath apartment. Coincidentally, it was the mirror image of the one their friends owned!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As writers who both work from home, Amanda and her husband appreciated that the two bedrooms were equally sized; one could be used as a roomy home office as well as guest quarters for out-of-town visitors.  At around 1,000 square feet, the unit also had southern exposures that provided the lovely, warm light they had been in search of. The only issue was the kitchen: it was dark and closed off, and connected to a strange pass-through pantry that housed a bar counter. Although it had been recently renovated, the craftsmanship was poor, as there were already cracks and scratches in the cabinetry and flooring. At first sight, Amanda thought it would be a deal-breaker. She was eager for a simple move, and very hesitant to embark on a renovation of any kind. But slowly, she and her husband talked themselves into it—after all, the apartment was ideal in every other way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22336 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-Before-02" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So as they began the process of closing on the apartment, Amanda <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their kitchen renovation</a> to Sweeten. As a first-time renovator, she wasn’t sure how to decide between the various bids. Our in-house team came to the rescue: a call with one of Sweeten’s project advisors proved to be useful. The chat gave Amanda the chance to think out loud and consider the pros and cons of each bid, and she selected her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/338020 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22338 mb-24 mt-24 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-01" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22340 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amanda’s vision for the kitchen reflected the feeling she wanted for the apartment as a whole: clean and bright, but not too modern or sterile. “We both love to cook and wanted to feel comfortable there, like we could make a mess,” Amanda explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They began by knocking down the walls that separated the kitchen and pantry from the living room and dining nook. (This is a common theme in the CHC kitchens! For more inspiration, check out Laura and Matthew’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a>, as well as Mario and Joe’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>.) One of the doorways from the kitchen to the hallway was closed off to extend the kitchen space across the entire wall. In a brilliant move, their Sweeten contractor turned the unused space next to the refrigerator into diagonal built-in shelving, now the perfect spot to display photos and items from their travels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the space was opened up, the couple turned their attention to the details. Early on, Amanda fell in love with a Mediterranean-inspired patterned tile in black, grey and white, and built the entire kitchen design to complement it. Although she had originally considered the tile as a backsplash, it made more sense as flooring—a wise suggestion from her mom. For the millwork, their Sweeten contractor sourced custom cabinetry with simple lines in a white shaker style. A single set of glass doors was installed to break the solid run of uppers. A rich walnut countertop was chosen for an added layer of drama—they had first considered using a lighter wood, but the darker wood coordinated better with the floors, a decision supported by their contractor. Although <span style="color: #000000;">the work surface requires</span> some upkeep, Amanda reports that she “adores them!” Brass knobs and pulls for the cabinets were next, along with a vintage-inspired metal light fixture for the ceiling. While they kept their fairly new appliances from the apartment’s previous renovation, they added a wine fridge next to the dishwasher.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22342 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22341 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-05-06.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-05-06" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, Amanda worked with her Sweeten contractor to resolve issues as they arose. In one incident, the cabinetmaker realized that the measurements had been off, and that a cabinet would have been essentially unusable because of an immovable obstruction. He worked with the contractor to revise the layout overnight, and went into production with very little delay. Aside from this challenge, things went mostly according to plan, not to mention the shortest wait time for board approval that we’ve ever heard—about two weeks! (Could it be because Sweeten has done dozens of renovations in her building?)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that they’re done, Amanda has words of wisdom for aspiring renovators: “Don’t rush the process. We were impatient and moved all our things in right after the demolition stage. This meant that all of our belongings went into one bedroom, stacked and wrapped in plastic. We went to stay with our in-laws for the duration of the project. Our contractor was very understanding and worked quickly, but didn’t cut corners and finished on schedule—it took about a month in the end. Although this didn’t happen with us, a hurried contractor might be tempted to be less detailed-oriented. Trust the contractor! He knows what he’s doing and how long it’ll take to do it.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22343 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-08-1-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-08" width="723" height="482" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As a book lover, Amanda’s one regret is that they didn’t think to carve out space in the wall shared between the kitchen and the hallway for built-in bookshelves. Still, as a first-time renovator, we think she did an amazing job, and like other Sweeten clients, she can always return for another renovation someday!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thank you, Amanda, for sharing this lovely space. We hope that you and your husband enjoy cooking up your next literary masterpieces.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When advertising executives Lia and Chris Wollen made the leap to homeownership, they didn’t have to go far. A waterfront condo, just four blocks from their Williamsburg rental, called to them with bridge views and appealing amenities. After envisioning the possibility of a townhouse, square footage in the two-bedroom was a concern, but with a stunning kitchen and bathroom renovation, plus strategic spending and saving in a few key spots, Sweeten helped them make this home their own (with time to spare for the arrival of a new baby this winter!). Read on for Lia’s take on this beautiful project.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-56292 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="Sweeten homeowners in their space renovated with Sweeten" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
</span>Guest post by Williamsburg homeowner Lia Wollen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After three years of renting in Williamsburg, the time came to try and buy a place. My husband, Chris, and I hoped to find a spacious townhouse or something bigger than our current place. Planning for a family and wanting outdoor space, we felt that broadening our search to less trendy neighborhoods was our only option. After exploring most of Brooklyn, however, we found that we kept coming back to Williamsburg.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Six months into our search, standing just four blocks south of our rental and looking out at the East River from the roof deck of a two-bedroom on the market, Chris said, “Well, if we can do this, then I want this.” It was a top floor unit with a small terrace off the living room, high ceilings, tons of light, and views of the Domino Sugar Factory, the river, and Manhattan. It came with basement storage, a parking space, and a piece of the private roof deck. Square footage was a concern, and we agreed that we would have to do a renovation before moving in to accommodate long-term needs, but first, the offer. Ours was accepted.</p>
<p>I found Sweeten in a general contractor search online and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filled out the project post form</a> to be matched with general contractors. Not too long after that initial search, I saw a blog post like this one, of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another gorgeous Sweeten renovation</a>. One of the photos looked right out at the Domino Sugar Factory—a replica of our new view! I realized pretty quickly it was a condo from our building and emailed Sweeten to ask them for the contractor. They connected us with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>. We met with him to kick things off and were thrilled with the fit and his vision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-56286 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02.jpg" alt="Kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56285 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01.jpg" alt="Bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The focus of our renovation was the kitchen and bath. I love to cook and wanted a hard-working, welcoming space to gather in. The bathroom needed a feeling of calm, an escape from the city. Our contractor was strategic with us in his approach. He started big so that we could see the possibilities, and then collectively, we pulled each other back to set reasonable expectations. This process was critical when it came to prioritizing our wants and needs and managing the dollars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We underestimated the significance of overall design in renovating, but it was the beautiful and technical unifier underneath everything we were trying to accomplish. The contractor addressed the kitchen simply: hide the fridge, fill in the odd angles and edges of the ceiling, and provide more counter/storage space. This blew our minds. It cleaned up the whole space and looked like a kitchen that meant to be there, rather than an afterthought.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The most exciting proposal from our contractor was to open up the ceiling and expose building beams that were encased in the walls of the kitchen and living room. This eliminated awkward lines and revealed some industrial elements, playing off of the raw materials mirrored across the street at Domino. We achieved separation of living room and kitchen while retaining warmth in the space, by limiting how far we (and our budget) extended the look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another small but important detail was the flooring. The contractor and his team buffed out the overly lacquered yellow floors to get back down to raw wood, and we chose a sky gray matte stain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were other more indulgent decisions made during the planning process, like a wine fridge. This felt like a low-cost, high-impact amenity you don’t typically get in the city and we were very excited about it. Chris insisted from day one that we have a garbage disposal, so that was non-negotiable. We also debated and ultimately agreed to a waterfall edge for the kitchen countertops. Our contractor had strongly recommended this as a focal point when entering the home, and he was absolutely right.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the bath, we kept the tub, sink, and hardware, but had everything retiled. We used leftover marble from the kitchen for the tub and installed a glass shower partition to open up the small space. We also built a new medicine cabinet and drawer for the sink to accommodate storage, and I found some new light fixtures to modern it up a bit.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris and I have a very similar aesthetic, so choosing materials, appliances, and fixtures was pretty straightforward. Before construction, I spent a lot of time pulling looks and materials from home and design websites, so we had a strong point of view right away. My must-have was a Wolf Range with the iconic red knobs. Snobby, kinda, but an important design element in an otherwise minimalist kitchen. The thing is also a weapon! (Chris started a grease fire the first time we used it.) Keeping in line with the stainless steel, we also bought a new Bosch dishwasher.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Material choices included Carrara marble, beveled and plain white subway tile with dark grout, classic New York hex tile in the bath, Edison bulbs, and glossy white cabinets. We chose IKEA cabinets because of another Sweeten renovation I caught on Instagram. It was very important to me that the cabinets went as high as they could go. I wanted an excess of clean-looking storage space and was not interested in dusting open shelving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56287 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowners in their renovated kitchen" width="1000" height="1494" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01-600x896.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were easy-going clients who trusted our contractor and his vision. We made things easier by not changing our minds and being open to his direction when we were undecided on something. The biggest decision, which we labored over the longest, was whether or not the kitchen should remain galley-style. The choice is obvious now, but there was something tempting at the time about toeing that suburban-house line with a big island to gather around. After the renovation, any concerns with square footage more or less went away. More, because we made so much out of what existed, and less because in March we found out we are expecting a baby boy this month!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">For Frans, a real estate broker, and his wife, Dalal, downsizing from a 2,500 square foot Flatiron District loft to a one-bathroom studio in neighboring Gramercy Park raised only one challenge: Where to put the mudroom! Size was hardly an issue for this unflappable couple, who set out to fit a few custom features into a much lower-maintenance space and came to Sweeten for a general contractor who could bring the vision together. Read on to see how they made room for a mudroom, master closets, and sleeping space for four in this mighty studio!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20138 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-25-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><span id="more-18627"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal were happy to leave behind extra square footage but wanted to bring a few specific features to their new home: A mudroom, to ward off sooty and sometimes snowy layers from city streets, wardrobe closets organized for two, and modern electrical wiring that would support an integrated system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They’d decided on this particular studio apartment because it offered a smaller but markedly similar version of the living room in their loft, and because eventually they planned to relocate to Long Island. So, a revamp would make this home convenient and comfortable until their next adventure, and put everything in place for a future crash pad. Frans enlisted a<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>to achieve the loft-like space they had in mind, while personalizing a number of key features throughout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main studio space was a standard boxy room that backed up to one wall of windows and existing decor was mostly dark and decades old. Because of the single source of light, it took some imagination to carve up the room for use in different ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal designated the windowed area as their new living room, and aimed to update and expand the kitchen, bathroom, and wardrobes while incorporating an urban mudroom into a large hall closet. They also wanted to replace all of the dated finishes throughout the apartment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18630 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" alt="sweeten_frans_apartment-before-03" width="600" height="796" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-03-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18628 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" alt="sweeten_frans_apartment-before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18629" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_frans_apartment-before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting with the dark parquet floors, their contractor and his team made way for 7-inch white oak planks from Siberian Wood Flooring, and installed them throughout the home, even replacing the kitchen’s old linoleum black and white floors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original 6 x 8-foot kitchen nook offered very little workspace surrounded by drab brown decor. Directly across from the nook was an oversized closet, which Frans hoped to incorporate into a new, larger kitchen design. The team took on major demolition to create a larger footprint and a workable U-shape, allowing for openness and access. They designed and built custom kitchen cabinetry, finished in putty-gray paint for the bottom cabinets, and white with glass panels for the upper line with seamless metal hardware. A number of cool custom features for specific storage needs are sprinkled throughout, and walnut shelving over the new under-mount sink helps extend the kitchen&#8217;s depth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">White linoleum counters were tossed and replaced with natural white Bianco Brazilian marble with gray veining. Frans and Dalal chose a matte white glass subway-style tile for the backsplash, which now runs up the length of the wall by the new island, where two dining seats, plenty of additional counter space, and black pendant lighting are in easy reach. Top-grade stainless steel appliances replaced the tiny outdated white units, and a large professional-grade hood was fashioned over the 30-inch Bertazzoni gas oven range.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the old closet, their contractor turned part of that into the mudroom Frans and Dalal were after, complete with custom shelving and various storage needs. And as an extension for the new kitchen, white custom cabinetry conceals the refrigerator and houses an exposed wet bar and wine fridge.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal worked with Kris to create two customized and flexible sleeping spaces. Kris built sliding accordion doors out of walnut wood and opaque resin that stack together out of the way when opened, or become solid partition walls when extended and closed off.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom section, Kris built a king-sized platform bed and matching nightstands. In the living room, the team devised a plan for a customized built-in wall unit, incorporating a queen-sized murphy bed and guest closet all conveniently and seamlessly hidden behind white lacquered plywood. Across the room from this addition, Kris installed a single walnut shelf running alongside the wall and just off the floor to corral entertainment equipment and living room knick-knacks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Frans and Dalal had a few simple ideas in mind. Plain white tiles, dim lighting, and very old superficial hardware had outworn their welcome. The couple planned to get rid of all the existing dated decor, change the footprint to allow for a larger, more accessible layout, and customize the adjoining closet to cater to “his and her” needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kris tore everything out and rotated the footprint by 90 degrees to swap the shower and vanity, allowing for greater use of space overall. Old floor tiles were ripped out and light gray ceramic tiles, mimicking that of stone, went down in their place. Upon entering the bathroom directly off the bedroom, you’ll find an oversized white porcelain sink nestled into a new walnut wood vanity built entirely by Kris, finished with ultra modern red and silver metal hardware. To the left of the vanity stands a new glass shower, bedecked with skateboard street-art-style wall tiles for a very artistic, creatively modern, and very hip “New York” aesthetic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new wardrobe situation is impressive. A walk-in closet was already in place, but the couple had a better plan to build a more streamlined and highly organized pass-through closet. Using the door to the old closet, Kris custom built movable shelving units out of corresponding walnut wood for shoes and other sections for hanging clothes. These movable units lead to a separate bathroom entry to the back of the studio, where the living room sits. The homeowners also gained a new compact washer/dryer to complete the turn-around.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Not one to miss the tiniest of details, Frans had the entire apartment wired for temperature, lighting, and sound control he conveniently accesses via phone. Frans and Dalal not only got the mudroom, but also managed to fold in multiple, flexible spaces to this origami apartment. Their new “studio” might be the only one in all of Manhattan with as many separate rooms as they now have, perfectly positioned within one unique space.</p>

<span class="img-label"> Guest post by Deniz, Clinton Hill homeowner</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Clinton Hill apartment is part of a large co-op building right between Myrtle and Willoughby on Clinton Avenue. We purchased our one-bedroom in 2000 &#8212; it&#8217;s on the 12th floor and has wonderful views of Brooklyn, including all three bridges. It had been updated in the standard format of all the apartments remodeled by the co-op and had a closed-in kitchen with a sliding door, plus a pantry directly across from the kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband, Ramon, had long had the idea of opening up the kitchen but we didn’t really update anything as 15 years went by. Fast-forward to 2015 and we now had a teenage son. We were basically “living” in the living room, allowing him the privacy of the bedroom. While it could have been the other way around, we enjoyed having access to the kitchen and living area once he was asleep, and we liked that when his friends came over, they had their own room for play.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17321 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17320" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we had the opportunity to fully renovate the apartment, we stumbled across <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a>, and met this Sweeten architect and designer. Our architect really listened to my husband&#8217;s years of thinking of the best ways to open up and restructure the apartment. He was able to help us accomplish what we ultimately wanted, which was to create a large and open kitchen that highlighted our views, and brought light from all the windows into the space. The architect skillfully designed the space and helped us work with our limitations. After all, no matter how many walls we tore down, it&#8217;s still less than 1,000 square feet, and space is always an issue. The architect designed the living room to be completely convertible so that we could use it as a bedroom and/or open living space for guests or dancing (our favorite way to spend time together).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to invest in new floors as our existing floors were quite pockmarked and difficult to find replacement tiles for quick fixes. I am a former modern dancer and soft, even floors that I can feel my bare feet on and dance and move on are something that I have always dreamed of having in my home. I really wanted the kitchen floors to match the rest of the apartment and knew it was possible to do that with the right kind of wood floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I fell in love with the Madera Trade floor samples and we chose a light color/tone to brighten the apartment and make it look large. We also invested in the countertops and backsplash in the kitchen, choosing granite in Brown Antique. These materials, along with a Viking stove and Fisher &amp; Paykel double-drawer dishwasher and wine cooler, were the high dollar investments. We went with IKEA cabinets as custom design was too expensive for our budget. We also soundproofed with sub-flooring, added soundproofing in two of our walls, and brought in a number of lighting fixtures (including some old Tiffany stained-glass shades that Ramon restored).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I love the easy maintenance of the floors. They are amazingly strong, and because of the way they are made (see Madera Trade details), they don&#8217;t scratch or stain. The stone countertop is also an object of daily appreciation, with easy maintenance that will last and last. After a year in the apartment, it still looks brand new.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten was easy to use and helped us find our fit easily. The architect and his team worked quickly to get the design completed and he helped us navigate finding the right crew for the job. Our contractors were highly professional and were here every day, essentially keeping to the time allotted. We did have some budgetary limits, and since we invested in some expensive materials, we have yet to complete the interior paneling which will ultimately create a convertible living room space. We are taking our time with the interior aspects and consider that a &#8220;phase two&#8221; of the project.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the meantime, we love the open space, the light, and the energetic flow of the apartment. We still have some decisions to make about the space, and since we are here long term, we are in no rush.</p>
