										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years after Kelly purchased her studio apartment in a lovely Brooklyn Heights co-op, she was ready to take on a major overhaul of the old appliances and cheap cabinets in the kitchen and bath. Unsure of the style she was after, Kelly sought the help of a designer who could run with big transformations to her little abode. Read on for our reveal of Kelly’s sparkling new kitchen, bathroom, and bonus closet renovations!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kellys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-sweeten-brooklyn-heights/"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17853" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kelly-kitchen2.jpg" alt="brooklyn heights co-op" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kelly-kitchen2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kelly-kitchen2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-17835"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><i>“Courtney was fantastic! Her process for learning about the project, the space potential, and understanding who I am is her true talent. I always felt that I had a voice and control over the design, which was important to me, but Courtney effortlessly brought it to life.”<br />
</i><i><i></i></i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><i><i>-Kelly, Brooklyn Heights homeowner</i></i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly had come to realize that living in a studio apartment meant that the kitchen would forever be the focal point—it “needed to rock”, as she put it. With old appliances and “cheap” cabinets and counters, the kitchen lacked a ton of functionality. An earlier attempt at open shelving left all sorts of things exposed, the cabinets extended just halfway to the ceiling, bar seating offered zero storage topped with a thin strip of counter prep space, and the stove and fridge were both miniature-sized. Kelly wanted to find an interior designer whose imagination wasn’t limited by tight spaces. She </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched her with Sweeten Expert Courtney</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a pro at bringing ambitious texture and color to spaces large and small. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17851" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Kelly wasn’t yet set on any specific style choices for her kitchen, Courtney was able to provide plenty of inspiration to get the renovation process started. The plans called for a few big fixes: Kelly’s team would extend the kitchen cabinets to ceiling height for more storage and finish the cabinetry with a variety of classic doors and transparent glass panes. The bar counter was significantly enlarged, granting more prep and dining space and doubling the kitchen’s drawer storage. And to accommodate a full-sized stove and fridge, Kelly moved the fridge out of the galley altogether.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17841 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="transparent glass panes" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17843 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="blue glass tiles" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17842 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="cement tiles" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly appreciated Courtney’s talent for mixing affordable items with the right amount of higher-end items for a polished look. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previous flooring consisted of brick-colored tiles that dragged the room into darkness. Kelly chose eye-catching cement tiles in a white and soft black mosaic, evoking a sense of Moroccan-inspired decor. Kelly bid adieu to the old, sagging cabinets and selected a dove gray IKEA set for the bottom base with a matte white finish for the uppers, plus elegant chrome hardware for all. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her newly-enlarged bar counter, Courtney helped Kelly pick butcher block for its warmth and price point, offsetting that material with a natural stone for the opposite counter. Ready to pack a lot of texture into the small space, Kelly added another pop of personality with a subway-style backsplash of luminous blue hand-glazed ceramic tiles. This detail, along with new undercabinet lighting was the key to unlocking all of that brightness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rickety oven range was replaced with a sleek stainless stove and Kelly scored a matching microwave stationed directly above it. A new dishwasher now resides where the old fridge once stood, and Kelly had new storage and pantry cabinets constructed along the opposite wall, framing the fridge perfectly. Kelly did away with the harsh ceiling light and opted for low-profile recessed lighting instead, complementing her new space gorgeously.  </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17844 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="dove gray ikea cabinets" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renovation plan grew to include the bathroom as well as the secret to the success of any great NYC studio: a highly organized walk-in closet! Without changing the footprint of the bath, Kelly carried several of the design choices from the kitchen over for continuity and coherence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went with the same marbled stone look for the floors and shower walls while replacing the tub with a new white porcelain upgrade. In other splash-prone areas surrounding the sink and shower, Kelly decided on a pale gray glass tile stacked in clean, contemporary lines. The old vanity was replaced with a dark wood cabinet boasting deep storage drawers and a large rectangular sink basin, crowned with a simple mirror and a soft-glow lighting strip. Two chrome shower heads were installed, one flexible and the other stationary, creating an elegant spa oasis. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last perk of this smart renovation came in the form of customizing the studio’s remaining closet, including shelving, section dividers, and a full-length mirror. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly’s lovely, revamped studio is proof that no space is too small for showcasing personal taste and imagination. We’re thrilled to hear that Courtney’s eye for design and hustle helped Kelly re-create this beautiful space!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re back in beautiful Brooklyn Heights to tour the rest of Hari and Kaity’s gorgeous one-bedroom apartment. Last week, we showed off the couple’s </span><strong><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hari-kaitys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new kitchen and bath</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and now we’re on to the creative ways in which they upped the glamour of their living and bedroom spaces and doubled (quadrupled?!) bedroom closet storage. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hari-kaitys-living-room-closet-renovation-brooklyn-heights/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17601 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-living-room-closet-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights Renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-living-room-closet-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-living-room-closet-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a><span id="more-17599"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hari and Kaity certainly did their homework when it came to collecting interior design inspiration and research. Perusing Pinterest and just about every architecturally-focused gallery out there, they pooled ideas and thought about renovations that had taken place in a neighboring apartment. They both loved the look of NYC’s quintessential pre-war buildings but also wanted to leave some room for more modern finishes. While the couple’s original </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten project post</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was mainly focused on upgrading their kitchen, their renovation evolved with the help of their </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and his team, as it began to make sense to take on work in other rooms while they were all at it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apartment’s floors had lost their luster, the living room was a blank slate, and the bedroom closet was clearly not cut out for a couple. Their contractor got to work, devising a plan to deliver smart upgrades in those high-impact places.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17503 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamal and his team sanded and stained the wood floors, bringing a rich depth and gleam to the wood planks that would serve as the basis for transformation in the living room and bedroom. Hari and Kaity initially pictured adding wainscot paneling to their living room and hallway, but after much debate decided it would be wasted once hidden behind furniture, so they opted for a series of decorative picture frame moldings instead. The simple addition was a low-cost and non-invasive way to give dimension to the boxy living room, and helps play up the shape of the apartment’s lovely window. They also decided to do away with ceiling fans, adding a glamorous tiered West Elm chandelier. This before and after is a testament to how refinished flooring, fresh paint, and luminous lighting choices can be enough to completely change a home!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17495 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-10.jpg" alt="west elm chandelier " width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-10.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-10-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17496 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-11.jpg" alt="picture frame moldings" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-11-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up, the bedroom and its limited closet space. Square footage in the bedroom left plenty of room for furniture, but the single closet was not a long-term option. Their Sweeten contractor set his sights on the bedroom’s far wall, seeing just enough room to create closets out of thin air without cutting off access to the bedroom window.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17504 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-04.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17511 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-01.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17497 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12.jpg" alt="full-size closets" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17603 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" alt="black knobs" width="600" height="899" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He built out two full-size closet structures, filled the interiors with Kaity’s vision for custom shelving and storage, and finished the additions with detailed paneling on the new closet doors. Hari and Kaity replaced all of the silver lever door handles throughout the home with brushed black knobs—another simple upgrade with striking effect. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what to do with the old bedroom closet? Because the original closet was so close to the bedroom’s entryway, an open office nook was a smarter use of space. The sliding doors were removed and a cozy little studious retreat fell into place. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The ink was barely dry on the closing papers of their new Brooklyn Heights co-op when Hari and Kaity decided they were ready to renovate a number of areas in the one-bedroom apartment, with the kitchen at the top of the list. The cramped galley space came with issues that could clearly be improved, and both Hari and Kaity also felt that their bathroom was past its prime. Here’s a look at dramatic upgrades in both spots. Check back next week for the full living room and bedroom reveal!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hari-kaitys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn-heights/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17510 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-kitchen-bathroom3.jpg" alt="hari-kitchen-bathroom3" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-kitchen-bathroom3.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-kitchen-bathroom3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-17481"></span>The kitchen in Hari and Kaity’s new place was cheery but filled with dated tile, attempts to overcompensate with bad lighting, and appliance placement that seriously cut into counter space. The windowed bathroom had great potential and had been carefully kept up, but Hari and Kaity saw opportunity for smarter storage and a chance to customize the tile with chicer selections. As first-time renovators, the couple decided to <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post their renovation project</a></strong> on Sweeten and we matched them with <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Jamal</a></strong>, who was ready to help the couple settle into a home complete with major updates in every room.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17507" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like most residents with NYC-style galley kitchens, Hari really wanted theirs to feel more open and emit more light—especially since this kitchen did not come with a window, as many do. The previous owner overcompensated by adding lighting strips to the tops and bottoms of the cabinets, but the kitchen’s layout was the real issue. Jamal got to work, designing a plan that would expose more of the room to the home’s entry and living area, relocate a key appliance, and expand storage and counter space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17518 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06-1.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17513 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17487" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jamal’s team cut into the kitchen’s entry door frame and brought the fridge a few feet outside of the kitchen’s walls, which in return allotted for more counter and cabinet space. They yanked old floor tiles and installed large, textured stone-like tiles in their place. New dove gray IKEA cabinetry with silver hardware plus a taller line of upper cabinetry, some with glass paneling, replaced the shorter set of originals. Hari and Kaity chose smooth white Caesarstone for the countertop and decided on white subway tile for the backsplash in a herringbone pattern, incorporating the classic yet modern aesthetic they were after. Under-cabinet and interior-cabinet lighting now brings a warm, inviting glow and stainless steel appliances (plus room for a brand new paneled dishwasher!) completed the turnaround.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Jamal set his sights on revamping fixtures and finishes for a more stylish and functional retreat. Hari and Kaity hoped to gain a little extra storage space, but otherwise, the upgrade would be fairly straightforward and relatively cosmetic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They chose a classic basketweave floor with marbled tiles and expanded the chic black and white look up the walls with white, undulated subway tile lined with a glossy black border. Jamal introduced a shower niche for subtle storage and replaced the old pedestal sink with a modern version that offered more room for soaps and daily necessities. Hari and Kaity kept the same mirrored medicine cabinet and pendant lighting, added a simpler set of glass shelves, and opted for a new Toto toilet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Hari and Kaity love the new kitchen and bath, and we can’t help but be psyched to showcase the innovative work in the rest of this home next week. Get ready for stunningly lovely refinished floors, picture frame molding, and envy-inducing closets!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>:  Anne, a <a href="https://www.studioparapluie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fashion illustrator</a>, bought her apartment in Brooklyn Heights over a decade ago and always knew she wanted to renovate the kitchen. The years went by and she &#8220;remained paralyzed at the prospect of finding a contractor and spending the money on such a large project.&#8221; She finally decided to treat herself to a complete renovation of the kitchen to make it more functional and beautiful. The tiny space (it was just 27 square feet!) had little light and was not enjoyable to cook in. She figured a wall between the kitchen and living space would have to come down. After interviewing a couple of firms that had been referred to her for the job that weren&#8217;t the right fit, she<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3801" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted her project </a>to Sweeten and was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Her Sweeten general contractor came up with a plan that offered practical solutions to reimagining her too-tight kitchen—including knocking down the wall between her kitchen and living room. They waited weeks for permits from the NYC Department of Buildings to remove the wall but finally got the approval to start demolition.</p>
<p>A peninsula replaced the wall, providing more storage and a space for entertaining. On the living room side, it hosts plenty of shelves and bookcases, perfect for Anne&#8217;s art supplies and book collection. There&#8217;s even a hidden outlet for a printer inside one of the cabinets and LED lighting underneath the unit too.  &#8220;The amount of storage that my contractor was able to include in the design–including shelving on the side for my cookbooks and a small wine rack—is truly miraculous,&#8221; Anne exclaimed.</p>

Instead of opting for the popular choice of white marble, Anne decided on a black marble countertop for most of the cook space. A hand-crafted maple wood countertop on the peninsula brings warmth, while brushed brass hardware and glass upper cabinet doors help set her desired tone of sophistication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;It feels as if I have moved into a brand new, luxury apartment! The abundance of light and the new functionality of this kitchen design have made me a very happy chef, and I am looking forward to making many hearty meals this winter from my favorite cookbook, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-Paris-Kitchen-Recipes-Stories/dp/1607742675" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>My Paris Kitchen</i> by David Lebovitz</a>,&#8221; she continued.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The dishwasher is the first Anne has owned in her adult life!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Renovations can be painful. Sweeten takes the hassle and guesswork out of the process. Overall it was a very pleasant experience and we are thrilled with the end product.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">-Ben C., Brooklyn Heights homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What do you do when you realize that your bathroom is just not working for you anymore? Ben &amp; Therese&#8217;s Brooklyn Heights bathroom wasn&#8217;t even 10 years old before they recognized that the space was ugly, outdated, and felt cramped &#8212; even little Enzo (pictured above) didn&#8217;t want to bathe in what he regarded as a cheap, generic tub &#8212; it was time for an update.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple took a savvy approach, collecting enough inspiration and research online that, together, they were ultimately able to design the bathroom of their dreams and a space that would reflect their personal tastes. They even built a 3D model of their ideas using Google SketchUp to help them plan and visualize the space; according to Ben, &#8220;we didn’t want to leave anything to chance, and we wanted to make sure we utilized every square inch as best we could.&#8221; With their very real vision, Ben &amp; Therese were more than ready to renovate, so <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project on Sweeten</a> to be matched with a vetted general contractor who would help them finish the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10793" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_02.png" alt="brooklyn-heights-bathroom-renovation" width="475" height="462" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_02.png 594w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_02-300x292.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ben &amp; Therese moved forward with their first match who was just the right fit for the project, and in just 4 weeks, Sweeten Expert Aleks and his team were able transform the generic bath into the homeowners&#8217; inspired vision. Here&#8217;s their space before &amp; after:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10794 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03.png" alt="brooklyn-heights-bathroom-renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10795 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_04.png" alt="brooklyn-heights-bathroom-renovation" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_04.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_04-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple took a universal ideal of clean, simple and modern, but made a space that is uniquely theirs by incorporating industrial elements like cement tile &amp; shower doors on sliding hardware, and adding a splash of color with Moroccan-inspired flooring tiles. Ben even says that it feels bigger and more open after renovating (a big plus in BK), not to mention that it&#8217;s much more functional. I love it, they love it, their friends love it, and little Enzo couldn&#8217;t be happier &#8212; sounds like a win!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great work to Aleks &amp; his team &#8212; and big congrats and many thanks to Ben, Therese &amp; Enzo!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">Last month, we shared the first-hand renovation</span> <a href="/2013/07/25/homeowner-guest-post-lisas-kitchen-renovation-pt-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story of Lisa Law</a><span style="color: #000000;">, a Brooklyn Heights homeowner who used theSweeten to update her crumbling kitchen, and today, we&#8217;re excited to share our 2nd homeowner guest post &#8212; coincidentally, this story also comes from a Brooklyn homeowner named Lisa who used theSweeten to renovate her kitchen! Lisa B., who works in the architecture &amp; interiors industry, and her husband Brian, a media studies professor &amp; author, had lived in their Kensington apartment for 8 years before taking the leap to renovate their kitchen. The couple</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted to Sweeten</a><span style="color: #000000;"> were matched with a Sweeten general contractor</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Today we have before &amp; afters of the transformed kitchen, along with Lisa&#8217;s insightful narrative on the new design and the process of making it happen.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9736 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/00b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-copy.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="256" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/00b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-copy.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/00b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-copy-300x128.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before renovating, our kitchen had its original, 1960s pine cabinets that were custom-built for the space, but had many layers of bad paint jobs and several of the doors didn&#8217;t close. We thought about trying to save them, but they were so solidly built that there was no way to cut them down to fit our new design plan. Plus, stripping all that paint off would have been a nightmare. The vinyl flooring was peeling, the wall oven didn&#8217;t work, the cooktop was barely functional and it was almost impossible to see what you were cooking since it was stuck in a corner under a metal hood. The countertops were horrible, fake woodgrain formica. When we first moved in, they were even worse &#8212; there was contact paper on them, which we were able to pull up, but we were disappointed with what we uncovered!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We needed a gut renovation! Everything had to go, down to the studs, which meant new drywall, ceilings, cabinets, fixtures, appliances, flooring, backsplash and lighting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9662 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-225x300.png 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I read about Sweeten a while ago in NYMag and kept it in the back of my mind because I knew we were going to renovate our kitchen. Although I worked in the interior design field, most of the contractors I knew were doing high-end renovations in Manhattan. I posted before pictures of my kitchen on the site and Sweeten introduced me via email to three contractors, all of whom I met with and who gave me estimates. They all seemed good, but as someone who knows about renovation, I appreciated that our contractor took extra time to really look at the kitchen, open up the cabinets, anticipate potential problems, and talk in depth about the process.<span id="more-9660"></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Design / Style</strong></span></em>: Having worked as a design assistant for an architectural interior design firm, I got to see a lot of custom kitchens being made, usually with white millwork and cabinetry, which I really like &#8211; it&#8217;s clean and timeless.  I learned about a lot of interesting materials and fixtures, too, and my style leans towards a mix of mid-century modern and contemporary &#8212; definitely not ultra-modern.  Even though the building was built in 1961, the apartment has some nice, almost mid-century modern, details: a curved hallway soffit, hardwood floors, baseboard moldings, and a really neat custom pantry closet with separate compartments.  I wanted the kitchen to fit the era of the apartment and the building, but still be updated. I knew that I wanted high gloss, white cabinets and appliances in order to create a feeling of space, plus they are so much easier to clean.  The kitchen is small, so having simple lines and using materials in a way that make the space feel bigger were key factors in the design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m not afraid of dark or saturated colors, but you have to know how to use them. Using the dark navy color on the back wall was yet another way to create the illusion of space by making that wall disappear, or recede, into the background.  You also need to consider the light in the space when choosing a wall color, and sometimes the right color can be almost counter-intuitive.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s always difficult to do a gut renovation in an apartment. Living in a construction zone is messy and stressful, although Nick&#8217;s team did their best to keep the dust and debris to a minimum.  Of course, budget was a challenge. You have to think about what to spend your money on to get the most bang for your buck.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Flooring</strong></span></em>: I was so tempted to spend a lot on the flooring, but in a small space, it&#8217;s often not really worth it.  I decided on porcelain tile because of price point and durability, but finding one was tricky; there weren&#8217;t a lot of color options that would compliment my countertops, which I had already picked out. I finally found an Italian porcelain, which wasn&#8217;t expensive; I used a big 12&#8243; x 24&#8243; tile in a staggered brick pattern laid horizontally to give the illusion of width.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Cabinets</strong></span></em>: I knew that I wanted to buy the cabinets from Ikea, which is a great, budget-friendly, option. They are really well-made &#8212; much better than cabinets from the big box stores and even sometimes better than the ones you can get from custom cabinet dealers. Planning a kitchen from scratch is a challenge, and if you are buying cabinets from Ikea, you really need to have a good idea of what you want before you order, especially since the cabinets only come in a limited range of sizes. The designers there are helpful, but only up to a certain point. I had to think a lot about the functionality of the space, the flow, and the most efficient way to store everything. It helps to have a contractor who has installed Ikea cabinets before, and Nick knew what to expect. Nick was also great at coming up with custom solutions &#8212; when the new cabinets didn&#8217;t fit exactly how we wanted them, he created a modified, open cabinet so that we would still get the added storage. He also built a very sleek, custom radiator cover which can be easily removed to get to the radiator, if necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Appliances</strong></span></em>: Because it&#8217;s a small kitchen, I also needed to think about things like appliance door clearance &#8212; we wanted an integrated dishwasher next to the sink, and had to figure out where was best to install it in order to keep from disrupting the flow in the kitchen. Even figuring out which way the cabinet doors would open was important to plan out ahead of time.  Finding a counter-depth, 32&#8243; wide refrigerator in a smooth white finish was also a challenge. Europeans have the leg up on American manufacturers when it comes to smaller, apartment size appliances.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I love my new kitchen!  Although I had picked every element of the new kitchen, I was concerned that the finished whole was not going to be equivalent to the sum of all the parts; would it work cohesively in the end?  There were a few stressful times, and I did have to make some quick decisions that could have gone awry, but ultimately, I set out to achieve some major objectives and I believe I more than met them all.  I have more cabinet space, more countertop space, larger appliances, it feels much more modern and homey, and it was done in a fairly budget- and time-conscious way.  In fact, my kitchen now makes the rest of my apartment now look pretty shabby!<span id="more-9437"></span></p>

<p><strong>The Budget</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I generally stayed within budget.  As I said, it was a &#8220;renovation-on-a-budget.&#8221; I had originally planned to spend $6,000, which increased to $9,000 when I decided to replace my appliances.  In the end, I hit almost $11,000, but that was because of a couple of “extras” that I did not account for – delivery charges, taxes, etc. I also asked Peter to install some new medicine cabinets in my bathroom. Renovations can be addicting, I just did not want to stop!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>30 Days After</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For me, the hardest part of having a new kitchen was figuring out where everything goes afterwards. I suppose in hindsight, I should have planned where my dishes, silverware, cleaning supplies, pantry items, etc, would be kept. My objective was just to maximize storage efficiently, as best I could, but I didn’t actually think about which cabinets would store which items!  Lucky for me, I put in enough drawers and cabinets that I just about found a place for everything. Minus a few tall items, like my Swiffer.  Oops – note to self for next time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’ve also put my kitchen through a few test runs at this point, having hosted two dinner parties already, one for my family (party of 7) and one for a few girlfriends (party of 4).  The new arrangement deftly allowed my fiancé and I to cook and clean together, with minimal fuss.  My kitchen report card after 30 days?  I still heart it – it’s so bright and clean and modern, I&#8217;m 100% glad I did it!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When I first moved into my apartment a year ago, I knew I wanted to renovate the kitchen.  I wouldn’t say the place is a fixer upper, but the kitchen was dated – the appliances were all too small, the backsplash was an awful, murky green tile, and the cabinets were too high and just did not provide enough efficient storage.  There was also a big hole in the wall right underneath the sink that I totally missed prior to moving in. With the costs of buying my first home, renovating wasn’t something I could take on immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This summer, however, my fiancé is moving in. So, after a year of living with a less than optimal kitchen, I did a bit of financial planning and I decided to bite the bullet and take the leap to do a renovation-on-a-budget.<span id="more-9349"></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Planning Process </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I started planning in early April, starting with where I would purchase my kitchen (easy, Ikea), whether I would replace my appliances (initially no, but then decided it would be better from a resale perspective to have “larger” appliances), and how I would find a contractor (um, who knew?).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kitchen Cabinets</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I planned a day out to Brooklyn Ikea with my fiancé, sister, and friend, mostly for moral support, but also because who doesn’t like to spend a day hanging out in Ikea?  I had at that point pored through the catalogue and had a general idea of what I wanted, which ended up being what I chose: <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AKURUM in Lidi White</a>. While at Ikea, I learned more about the planning services they offer, and I was happy to pay $99 for someone to come over and measure my kitchen and upload the specifications into the Ikea Kitchen Planner (more on how this worked out below) before I started playing pretend architect and interior designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Appliances</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I decided to replace my 20 inch range with a 24 inch range, my small white refrigerator with a shiny new LG “skinny” fridge, keep my 17 inch wide dishwasher because I had never actually used it, and install a range hood (even though it wouldn’t vent outside, I thought it must help somewhat to circulate the air above the cooktop).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Contractors</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I spoke with 5 contractors, each of whom I found via a different source.  The first was through Ikea’s primary contractor, which was the company that came to measure my kitchen.  The second, I found while trolling through ikeafans.com.  The third was an independent contractor, introduced to me through a friend.  The fourth was a contact of my mother’s.  The last was through a submission to Sweeten, which I had read about in a blog post on Apartment Therapy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, I made the decision to go with #5, Peter Ramirez of NYC Pros, who I was matched to by theSweeten.  Peter was professional, thorough, and committed to staying within our agreed upon budget.  He even sat down with me prior to my big purchase at Ikea just to make sure I didn’t miss minor things like toe kicks and hinges and the like.  As we all know, going to Ikea for small items is a big pain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Countertops, Flooring and Backsplash</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I also ended up going through Peter’s contact for my countertops. It was something I had not originally planned for, but I am glad I decided to go with quartz as opposed to the laminate that Ikea sells. It took me two trips to Williamsburg and a comparison trip to Home Depot, but I now have amazing gray stone countertops that really lift the whole look and feel of the kitchen, I love it. My backsplash and floor tiles were a simple purchase made on homedepot.com, since I already had an idea of what I wanted – gray stone-like laminate tiles and a clear glass backsplash.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Renovation Process</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All I have to say is that your choice in contractor drives your overall experience, because you must trust that things will get done according to your expectations from a quality and time-frame perspective. We started the renovation on May 7<sup>th</sup>, a day after I had originally planned, because yours truly took longer to get all the paperwork submitted to the coop board than expected.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Day 1 was demolition and putting in the new floors.</li>
<li>Day 2 was repairing the (gross) walls post demolition.</li>
<li>Days 3 and 4 were installing the base cabinets, which required cutting into wall.  Regardless of the exact measurements and careful layout on the Ikea Kitchen Planner, one lesson learned is that in reality, not everything will fit perfectly.  End of the weekend brought the countertop templating as well.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-during-renovation"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48017 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-During.jpg" alt="kitchen with flush mounted ceiling lights and cabinets without doors during renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-During.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-During-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-During-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Day 5 was wall cabinet installation.</li>
<li>Day 6 was installing appliances.</li>
<li>Day 7 was plaster and painting.  Day 7 was also supposed to be countertop installation day but our guy ended up with a burst eye artery!  So off to the hospital and for some much needed rest he went.</li>
<li>Day 8 became new countertop day, with some backsplash installation.</li>
<li>Day 9 wrapped up the backsplash and cleanup. Yes, the total renovation was only 9 days! I suppose when you have a small kitchen, it is totally doable.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, my fiancé and I were in and out of the apartment about once every other day, just to check out the progress and to make some executive decisions, like how high the backsplash was going to extend.  I feel like I got really lucky with the entire renovation. Not only was everything done on time, which I have heard almost never happens, but it was really pretty painless. In fact, by the time Peter and his team left, it was somewhat bittersweet, I was all done!</p>
