<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Landing a historic fixer-upper in Chicago</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Our apartment, which we bought in 2019, is in a historic greystone building in Chicago’s Lakeview East neighborhood. A three-bedroom fixer-upper, we chose it knowing we could renovate it to our exact specifications. The unit had, curiously, two front doors, neither of which was in a logical location, and we wanted to find a solution to that problem. We needed to renovate the two <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathrooms</a>, which had been largely untouched for decades. And finally, we wanted to redo the living-room fireplace façade as a finishing touch to our renovation.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03.jpg" alt="Living area with window alcove and fireplace" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">The apartment is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-floor unit</a> in a three-flat building; it’s around 1,575 square feet and has a 160-square-foot rear deck. We have two French bulldogs and wanted the condominium for its generous size, but we also appreciated its historic status and original character. We’d noticed that historic properties often had their period aspects stripped out. We wanted to bring modern updates to the space, maintain its vintage features, and incorporate mid-century touches into our design.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">We’d recently completed a challenging remodel of the condominium’s kitchen, and felt we needed a new contractor to tackle the next phase. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, fielded responses, and soon found a contractor we believed was well-matched to the job.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Solving an odd problem: two front doors</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Moving our home’s entrance door was perhaps the change that required the most thought. Originally, the apartment had two front doors! One went into the living room, and the other opened into the smallest of our three bedrooms, which we think was the housekeeper’s room at some point. Door No. 1 limited the wall space in our relaxing and entertaining room. Door No. 2 made that tiny bedroom even smaller and less functional. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01.jpg" alt="Entryway leading into the dining area" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s8"></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8">Initially, we’d decided to make the door to the small bedroom our primary front door, converting that room to a foyer. We’d tear out the door leading to the living room and drywall over it. This approach would have required only a slight expansion of the width of that door opening to the bedroom, and replacing trim in a couple of spots. But in the end, we decided the quick fix wasn’t the best option.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s8">Remodeling a new apartment entry</span></h3>
<p>After discussing it with our Sweeten contractor, we decided on a plan to create yet a third door. We would close off the two original entry doors and move the apartment’s front door to a new location in the dining room. These changes would give us full walls in both rooms. Closing Door No. 1 ultimately allowed for a friendlier, more functional furniture arrangement in the living room. Eliminating Door No. 2 created space for us to install a large storage system comprising a Murphy bed and a desk in the former housekeeper’s room. Two absolute wins.</p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Bed.gif" alt="Gif of the murphy bed closing and transforming into a desk" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52415" /></span></h3>
<p><span class="s8">Now our apartment needed an entirely new entry. For the new opening, we chose a modern front door that contrasts with the vintage character of the dining and living rooms within. We’re particularly happy about the contrast between “new and old” as you enter our home.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Two black-and-white bathroom upgrades</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s9">Next, we moved on to updating the two </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/two-bathroom-renovation-for-resale-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s8">small </span><span class="s9">bathrooms</span></a><span class="s8">. We wanted to update the plumbing, tiling, and fixtures, plus add exhaust fans to both baths. We planned to source and provide all fixtures, including a bathtub, faucets, lighting, fans, and more. To stay on budget, we asked our contractor to provide only the rough materials and labor. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16.jpg" alt="Bathroom with white tiles, black tiled floor, and glass paneled shower" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52412" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p><span class="s8">&#8220;We found Sweeten’s detailed contractor reviews helpful, and credit those in part for our successful hire.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Aiming for a clean aesthetic consistent with our just-completed kitchen, we chose to tile every wall surface from <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/white-subway-tile-bathroom-7-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor to ceiling with white subway tile</a>. We’re pleased with the way this brings attention to our 10-foot ceilings. We chose similarly timeless black marble hex tile for the floors, hoping it would conceal dirt, hair, and other buildups between regular cleanings. Finally, we indulged our love of mid-century furniture, integrating matching bathroom vanities of that era’s style.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15.jpg" alt="Bathroom with white subway tile and matte black fixtures" width="1000" height="664" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52411" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15-300x199.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15-600x398.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14.jpg" alt="Bathroom with white subway tile and small wooden vanity" width="1000" height="1555" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52410" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14-193x300.jpg 193w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14-579x900.jpg 579w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3 class="p6"><span class="s8">Achieving a sleek subway tile fireplace</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8">The last idea we wanted to implement was in the living room, where we’d decided to add decorative subway tile around the original fireplace. When we purchased the apartment, the walls around the firebox were drywalled; </span><span class="s9">we wanted to reclaim the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/adding-fireplace-renovation-gas-wood-burning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace’s role as a focal point</a> for the living space. We chose a glossy white subway tile for the new fireplace façade to brighten the space. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">The key to finding the right general contractor in Chicago</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Everything went remarkably smooth with the string of projects. Our Sweeten contractor was professional and provided clear <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advice on issues big and small</a>, including the placement of fixtures, the color of the grout, and more. We leaned heavily on our contractor’s expertise. We experienced no real challenges—this was in contrast to our experience during other phases of our broader renovation, with different contractors. We’ve renovated before, and we know: The wrong contractor can add unnecessary stress, delays, and cost. The right contractor can make the process relatively painless.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04.jpg" alt="White tiled fireplace with decorative clock above" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52408" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17.jpg" alt="Exterior of the home in Chicago" width="1000" height="1472" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52413" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17-204x300.jpg 204w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17-600x883.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s8">We found Sweeten’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovators-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed contractor reviews</a> helpful, and credit those in part for our successful hire. We appreciated the additional insurance—and assurance—Sweeten provided. The right resources helped us to mostly <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2020-home-renovation-costs-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay on budget</a>, too. We had no major cost overruns. A few of our fixtures arrived damaged, but we were able to quickly source replacements and stay on schedule.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">The end result has made us very happy. We’re satisfied with our design choices, and the way our contractor’s work and craftsmanship aligned with our vision. It’s all about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding the right partner</a> for the project.</span></p>

<h3>Finding the right time to renovate</h3>
<p>We’ve all walked into homes where two different sets of ideas are in play. This renovation was part of a quest for cohesion. We’d established an aesthetic when we’d updated the kitchen two years before, and we were now putting in a bathroom and closet we could love. The old set of ideas included a showerhead on the long side of the bathtub and pitch-dark storage spaces. We were not sad to see them go.</p>

<p>We are Kate, a creative director for a women’s wellness startup, Max, a data analyst at a tech firm, and Lenny, a female Pitbull/Rat Terrier mix. We live in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in a 1926 co-op building. We’re first-time homeowners of a 610-square-foot one-bedroom apartment. We purchased in January 2016 as first-time buyers. We didn’t change the place until 2019 when we renovated the kitchen.</p>
<p>We planned to wait to continue renovating, but the combination of being home due to Covid-19 and having few opportunities to spend money meant that we wanted a nicer place and we accelerated our savings plan. We decided to go for it this year and renovate the bathroom and our closet as a single project.</p>
<h3>Swapping out the tub for a shower</h3>
<p>Remodeling the 35-square-foot bathroom was a style choice, but also one of function. In the existing room, neither the floor nor the walls were level. We hated that the shower head was in the middle of the wall on the tub’s long side. We wanted a modern stand-up shower with a glass door instead of the step-in tub and wraparound shower curtain. The closet redo made sense to tack on because of its proximity to the bathroom. We wanted to combine two small adjacent closets—one accessible from the bedroom, the other from the hallway—into a single large one. Neither closet had electrical wiring, so finding our things was a challenge. We knew we could net more storage if we merged them into one large closet.</p>

<blockquote><p>
This was easily the most challenging phase of the project, since we’d left Brooklyn on a road trip and were far away when the contractor discovered the problem. We didn’t need to worry.
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Creating a whole new bathroom layout</h3>
<p>We started in the bathroom. We rearranged the whole bathroom, so this was not a simple “rip and replace.” Moving the shower to the back wall meant relocating the toilet and reconfiguring the plumbing proved necessary. Our biggest questions were about the unknowns. In a nutshell, here’s what we learned: You can’t prepare for what’s behind a wall or under the floor. You carry out the demolition and hope to get lucky.</p>
<p>We’d decided we wanted white subway tile with a dark gray grout on the walls. The floor tiles had a distressed texture in dark gray. The vanity’s light wood finish matches our kitchen cabinets, and it offers tons of storage even though it’s only a 24-inch unit. The toilet search was more challenging than expected since we had specific size requirements, but eventually, we found one we liked.</p>
<h3>The contractor handles the discovery under the subfloor</h3>
<p>We’d heard plenty of nightmares about people moving plumbing in New York City bathrooms and hoped our fate might be different, but it wasn’t. Having completed most of the demolition, the contractors lifted the floor tile. Beneath the visible layer, they discovered two additional layers of tile. Once the subfloor was exposed, it was clear it had been compromised, both by years of trapped moisture and the weight of those three tile layers.</p>

<p>The co-op&#8217;s engineer brought onsite recommended pouring a new concrete slab, which added expense and impacted our schedule. This was easily the most challenging phase of the project since we’d left Brooklyn on a road trip and were far away when the contractor discovered the problem. We didn’t need to worry. Our contractor worked with the building’s engineer to pour the new slab to the required specifications.</p>
<h3>Smooth communication with their contractor</h3>
<p>Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors provided us with updates via an online project-management tool that <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped with communication throughout the job</a>. The team used the tool to share photo and video updates. It helped to keep everyone in sync and organized. That platform really streamlined the conversation regarding every aspect of the job. The bathroom came together exactly as we’d hoped. We’re thrilled with the new storage, including an inset bottle nook in the shower. And the rain showerhead combined with our building’s incredible water pressure makes for an immersive experience every morning.</p>
<h3>Combining closets for a larger one</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-remodel-your-closet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded bedroom closet</a> came next. The contractors removed the wall separating the two smaller closets in order to merge them; we kept the door on the bedroom side. I love being able to see things in the closet, thanks to the increased space, and the addition of wiring let us install good lighting. For the shelving, we took a hybrid approach, buying all of the parts separately. The white shelves are typical closet shelves, but the racks are meant for garage storage. We can finally find our clothes!</p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="walk-in-closet-with-shelves" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="small custom walk-in closet storage with shelves after renovation" width="800" height="1200" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51190" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>This closet hack would also mean addressing the hallway with trim and paint. On that side, the contractors closed the door opening and painted the wall, where we later created a gallery wall for art and photos. The previous door trim was missing chunks of wood (likely from people moving big objects in/out of rooms and banging into the door frame.) It had also been painted a million times and was generally an eyesore. We knew replacing the door and window trim would go a long way towards refreshing the space. The red light fixture provides a nice pop of color.</p>

<h3>Their Sweeten contractors: the right renovation partners</h3>
<p>This was a much larger project than we thought we’d be taking on this year, but it worked out beautifully. Our Sweeten contractors were transparent about billing, supplying us with perfectly itemized invoices. They were terrific problem solvers, with elegant design sense and ideas that enhanced our final results. We love our new apartment!</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42180" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-09-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="2000" height="1383" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-09-1.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-09-1-300x207.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-09-1-600x415.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<h3>A new art deco apartment home<span>—in need of work</span></h3>
<p>Lindsay, Nicholas, and their cat, Sibyl, returned to New York City after two years in Baltimore and landed on a 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom co-op in upper Manhattan. “Nicholas fell in love with the [art deco] lobby, and we both loved that it was right across the street from Inwood Hill Park and has a killer view of the Cloisters,” said Lindsay.</p>
<p>The apartment itself was so-so. It had some classic art deco features, like a sunken living room with herringbone wood floors, which Lindsay and Nicholas wanted to mix with their mid-century tastes. A bland kitchen and bathroom needed some help. The molding, doors, and paint were also due for a refresh. And then there were those two things many New Yorkers consider an ultimate luxury<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>installing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washing machine and dryer</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42169" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that pairs renovators with vetted general contractors. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/9735" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their art deco apartment remodel</a> and chose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design-build firm</a> to execute the construction and the design. Lindsay and Nicholas were given a six- to eight-week timeline from start to finish and camped out in a sublet during the renovation. A few hiccups along the way stretched that timeline (more on that later).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The plan was to gut renovate the bathroom and make minor changes in the kitchen while doing mostly cosmetic updates to the rest of the apartment. A standout feature in the living area is the sliver of wallpaper that peaks out from the small hallway off of the living room. “Since it’s such a small space, we figured we could go a little crazy,” said Lindsay. That “little crazy” translated to an art deco-style wallpaper with teal, purple, and gold accents. “Even our friends who hate patterns and bright colors love it,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, the current layout had a nook where the previous owners had placed a small breakfast table. Lindsay saw this as an ideal way to add more counter space. There was a miniature dishwasher “which made no sense since there was plenty of room for a full one,” said Lindsay. Rather than <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gut renovate</a> the kitchen (a decision the couple later regretted), they refinished the existing “country-style” cabinets in a gray modern tone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dark grout in the backsplash tiles upped the modern feel. The only appliance they replaced was that tiny dishwasher. “We are happy with how it came out,” said Lindsay, “but salvaging some of the kitchen turned out to be more work than a full gut. It would have been better to just pay extra and get what we really wanted,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the only original feature that remains is the cast-iron tub with its detailed edges. Lindsay and Nicholas had it re-enameled so it matched the new bathroom. A new washer/dryer would replace an existing shower area and a shower would be added to the bathtub. For maximal storage, shelving lined the laundry wall in hard-to-reach places and double doors were installed to hide the clutter.</p>
<p>When the decision came to choose either a console sink or a vanity, they decided on a console. (The under-the-sink space became the new location for Sibyl&#8217;s litter box.) For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>, a large medicine cabinet, and niche shelves along the bathroom and shower walls did the trick. A matte black hexagonal <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tile</a> became the new backdrop in dramatic fashion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06.webp" alt="black and white bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-57241 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A feature the couple recommends to other renovators is <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom storage</a>. To remedy some oddly-placed shelves and a rod, their Sweeten contractor ripped everything out of the bedroom closet and installed a new system that can easily be changed later on as storage needs shift. “Custom designing the closets made a huge difference in how useful the spaces were,” said Lindsay.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42171" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-04.gif" alt="Washer dryer renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project hit a major snag when it came to the electrical work which pushed the end date back. Wiring dedicated to powering the washer/dryer had to be installed and ripped out twice from the ceiling. Despite this, it still shorted out the power after only a few uses. In the end, it was discovered there was a faulty part in the basement and the situation was fixed. Throughout the issue, Sweeten&#8217;s customer service, which checks in on renovations until projects are completed, stayed in communication until it was resolved and helped coordinate a new realistic timeline agreeable to all parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After their experience, Lindsay and Nicholas came out with a home they loved, but also some things they would do differently next time. “Always gut renovate,” said Lindsay. “We were trying to be thrifty by keeping the kitchen cabinets.” The other tip: plan for the renovation to take twice as long. But ultimately, the Sweeten contractor did a fantastic job,” said Lindsay<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>and enhanced the features of the apartment to turn it into a unique home for their family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A couple&#8217;s optimism yields a washer-and-dryer—and more—in Brooklyn</h2>
<p><em>Who wants to schlep laundry up and down five flights of stairs? That’s what motivated Lynn, Craig, and their pooch Pistol to renovate their first home, a 1,200-square-foot Prospect Heights co-op. But not so fast. First, they couldn’t find a contractor willing to take on the job of remodeling two tiny bathrooms. Then they couldn’t get one on board for a washer-and-dryer install. They eventually turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, where they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> and were matched with a vetted general contractor not only </em>willing,<em> but excited, to take on the job. All this while the clock was ticking on their move-in date.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34610 size-full" title="double-hung-window-accent-light" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-12.jpg" alt="double hung window and accent lighting in living room with gray couch and rug after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><em>Guest post by Sweeten homeowners Lynn and Craig</em></p>
<p>After living in rentals forever—from 300-square-foot studios to windowless apartments— we were ready to buy something of our own. When Lynn co-founded her business—Dome, a multidisciplinary design studio—in 2014, we casually began to look for a place where she could work from home.</p>
<p>For two years, we visited open houses to learn about the Brooklyn housing market. Many of the homes felt oddly chopped up, hastily constructed, overpriced, or were projects too intimidating for us to tackle for our first home purchase. We wanted a space that felt open and bright, where we wouldn’t hit the walls within a year, and that was in a welcoming neighborhood.</p>

<p>When we found this two-bedroom, 1.5 bath co-op in a circa 1930s Prospect Heights building close to express subways, our friends, Prospect Park’s off-leash area, and saw it had lots of space and light, we immediately put in a bid. We thought we had a chance, given it was a steep fifth-floor walk-up—a deterrent for many buyers in a competitive market. We ended up losing the bid, only to have the owner come back to us weeks later offering us the home after the first deal fell through. Our move-in date was two months later, in mid-September.</p>
<p>We started out just wanting a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laundry hook-up</a> in the half-bath. We’d spent years hauling bags to coin laundromats and felt a washer-and-dryer were non-negotiable. But once we started thinking things through, our small project ballooned. We soon realized that both bathrooms needed to be gutted. The full bath had no storage and was on a 10-inch platform to accommodate mid-century plumbing. The half-bath was previously used as a cat’s bathroom, accompanied by a pet door—and a significant odor.</p>

<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Sweeten project post</a>, titled “Make These Bathrooms My Favorite Rooms” captured our optimism to transform these small, dismal rooms into a smarter space for our lifestyle and aesthetic taste. So, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose our Sweeten contractor</a>. We didn’t expand either footprint, but were strategic about how each element would really be used, cleaned, and look next to each other.</p>
<p>Overall, we replaced four bathroom and closet doors made of tired, hollow-core faux wood with solid-slab, single-panel Shaker doors. The dark wood floors in the rest of the apartment ground the space and the white walls reflect light. The high-contrast gave us a great foundation for our furniture, textiles, and plants.</p>

<p>We also saw a great opportunity to demo the dining room and envisioned a “great room” with flow between the kitchen, dining, and living rooms where we could host gatherings. After living in claustrophobic rentals, we wanted the first impression to be of openness and light.</p>
<p>Lynn’s background in exhibit design allowed us to renovate without an architect. We measured each wall’s dimension and built a model of the home in <a href="https://www.sketchup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SketchUp</a>. We could quickly see how to scale any fixtures or make changes. And, the model helped us discuss in more detail with contractors, such as rear-outlet toilets, fixture finishes, grout types, and bath fan sone ratings (for loudness).</p>

<p>The dining room walls were not load-bearing, and there are always surprises when you start opening up floors and walls. When our Sweeten contractor demo’d the dining room walls, he found charred beams in the ceiling from a long-ago fire. We had no idea there had been damage. He reinforced the ceiling with new wood to ensure structural stability.</p>

<p>In the full bathroom, which is 35 square feet, we weren’t sure if we’d be able to drop it down 10 inches. Before we had even hired our contractor, he took out his chisel and broke a peephole into the floor to see what was possible. He gave us confidence that we could make it work, ultimately dropping the entire bathroom, keeping the bathtub at the elevated height, and building out a wall for our new sink and cabinet fixtures.</p>

<p>We included so many details in this bathroom that make all the difference on a day-to-day basis, including a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighted</a> medicine cabinet with outlets inside to allow us to charge our toothbrushes out-of-sight, thereby removing clutter; the near-silent bathroom fan serves as the main light and is hidden without a vent cover; and a wall-hung sink and cabinet allows for more storage and easier cleaning underneath.</p>

<p>As for the half-bath—only 24 square feet—several contractors, who initially inspected the job advised us to forego the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer-and-dryer</a> altogether, saying it was impossible, or that we had to tap into our toilet line and disrupt the apartment below. Our Sweeten contractor&#8217;s plumbing team found a simpler solution by tapping into the small sink&#8217;s line. We got a compact, ventless Bosch washer-and-dryer to accommodate the water line, electrical load, and tight space in the bath. Remodeling this room has been a life-changer.</p>
<p>The other issue in this space was the overwhelming odor of cat urine. We tried every odor-reducing spray and paint on the market, and used black lights to expose urination spots, but in the end, we had our contractor gut the walls and floor down to the slab to remove the contaminated wood. Every visit during the renovation had our contractor sniffing in corners, trying to find new origins of contamination. Thankfully, it does not smell like cat pee anymore. We also replaced the dated fixtures in that bath with the smallest toilet and sink we could find.</p>

<p>Overall, everything went pretty smoothly. Our biggest challenge, really, had been finding a contractor. But Sweeten gave us three leads, and our contractor came to the first meeting as if he already had the job, giving realistic explanations for what it would take to accomplish the work. During the renovation, he rarely said no or told us a change wasn&#8217;t possible. As we added to our original scope, he was incredibly flexible and adjusted his timeline and the work to hit our mid-September move-in date. He gave us recommendations when we didn’t know what to buy, explained to us what was needed, and helped us quickly to complete the work.</p>

<p>Sweeten helped us, too, by getting us to clarify our scope and put a realistic budget into our initial post. We learned that even though our timeline was compressed, renovating a home is practically a second job if you undertake it on your own with just a contractor. We now understand why people hire architects. For those with less design experience or who are strapped for time, it would be helpful to work with a professional who can do the groundwork for you.</p>

<p>Another piece of advice is if you can do a major renovation before moving in, bite the bullet and get it done. Don’t put off with cleaning the dust later on. We plan to continue renovating in phases, but wanted to get the most disruptive work completed before moving in.</p>
<p>Having gone through four rentals in six years, we always struggled to feel at home. Our new space is beautiful and feels like something we can make our own. We enjoy inviting others into it as often as possible.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When Vitoria, an art historian, and Jonathan, a location scout, purchased their 650-square-foot co-op in a century-old building in South Williamsburg, they began discussing renovations right away. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22955#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches homeowners with vetted general contractors, and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4378" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with a Sweeten contractor</a> to create a new home for the couple, daughter Asa, and Ramona, the family dog.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-04-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33753 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-04-1-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33563 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-08-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, living room, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment was in &#8220;okay&#8221; shape, but it had little storage and the materials used were poor quality—laminate flooring and old Ikea cabinets. It would need a lot of updates along with better quality materials, such as kitchen countertops and new hardwood floors, but they were limited on budget and time. Some of their efforts went into looking ahead toward selling in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vitoria, who is inspired by the simplicity of Japanese design, envisioned uncluttered white space with lots of natural wood color. “Since we are growing a family in a small space, a place that looks tidy and serene was a priority. For us ‘negative space’ is actually positive,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33565 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-10-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, living room, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33564 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-09-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, living room, hardwood floors, natural wood" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>We replaced the cheap laminate with thick hardwood [so] the unevenness is barely noticeable.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">Once the demo began, they were faced with a few surprises including rotten pipes in the kitchen sink and toilet and uneven floors. </span>Changing the floor was imperative. Vitoria said she had some “crazy ideas” to put in cork floors or use raw plywood cabinets in the kitchen, but then realized those materials would not increase the resale value and were too specific to her own personal taste. They opted instead for a pre-finished <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oak hardwood</a> which their contractor suggested. She admitted she was scared at first since the color of the boards varied quite a lot, but she soon fell in love. “The wood floor has so much personality!” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33754 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33567 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, hardwood floors, white cabinets, quartz countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33566 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-03-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, white cabinets, quartz countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While redoing the subfloor in the bathroom, they decided not to renovate all the subflooring throughout the rest of the apartment to save time and money, &#8220;Since we replaced the cheap laminate with thick hardwood,&#8221; Vitoria said. &#8220;the unevenness is barely noticeable.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their Sweeten contractor helped with the layout of the kitchen, fitting in more storage with cabinets that were taller and deeper. They kept the stove and washer-and-dryer in the kitchen and purchased a new refrigerator. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrow cabinet for their spices</a> flanks the hood.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33568 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-02-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, hardwood floors, quartz countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33569 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, white cabinets, quartz countertop" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few &#8220;must-haves&#8221; on the couple&#8217;s list; in fact, Vitoria chose a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quartz countertop</a> before she even chose a contractor. “Quartz is a great material, especially for clumsy cooks like me,” she said. She also insisted on a Toto toilet and a slim Blomberg refrigerator. “These were non-negotiable. I had to have them!” Since the remodel, Vitoria said, “I actually have more space in the cabinets than I have things to put in them.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She also loved the idea of untreated pine for the open shelves above the sink to store what she called their “showpieces.&#8221; While visitors may think it’s yet to be painted, she is happy with the result.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33571 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-01-723x1084.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg" width="723" height="1084" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33572 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, hexagon floor tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They had a good working relationship with their contractor, who not only had a great personality but sourced materials that fit their taste and worked for resale while being adept at managing their budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When their contractor took up the bathroom floor, he discovered the original 100-year-old tiles, which were cracked and loose. He had to remove two layers of tile and redo the subfloor, which delayed the project by a couple of days. &#8220;Throughout the whole process, he was very aware that we had no wiggle room in the budget and was super cost-conscious. We are extremely grateful for that,&#8221; said Vitoria.</p>
<p>During the chaotic periods, they were glad to have Sweeten in their corner. Vitoria liked that Sweeten contacted her often during the renovation, commenting that it made her feel well taken care of and gave her peace of mind.</p>
<p>Post-renovation, Vitoria knows that there will always be unexpected issues no matter how good your contractor is or how fat your budget. “But having a home that you love makes it worth every penny spent,” she said. “Although my home is small, it feels spacious. I confess I only leave if I have to.”</p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="gray-white-bathroom-with golden-fittngs" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49085 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="Gray and white bathroom with golden bathroom fittings and shower curtain rod over white bath tub after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Update an inefficient bathroom in Queens</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Kate and her husband, Daniel, had lived in their two-bedroom co-op in Jackson Heights, Queens, for four years. Redoing the bathroom and kitchen were always on the table, but since Daniel is a food writer who needed to experiment with recipes, he went to Sweeten for the kitchen renovation first. “We didn’t have the funds to do them both at the same time,” explained Daniel. Fast forward a few years and a baby on the way “really forced our hand with the bathroom renovation,” he said. “We are either doing it now or never.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adding a bathtub was just the immediate necessity. There was also an issue with the water temperature; the shower would either freeze or scald you. The radiator was installed on a wall above head height, which Daniel thought was odd. (“Doesn’t hot air rise?”  he asked.) The bathroom looked like it had been revamped in the &#8217;70s with plenty of drab beige tiles decorated with floral prints. The couple wanted to bring the lagging aesthetic in-line with the prewar design of the building.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Daniel-Gritzer-Before2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="beige-bathroo-with-glass-door" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49087 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Beige bathroom with glass door for walk in shower before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="beige-bathroom-door-with-handle-beige-wall-tile" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49104 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-02-1.jpg" alt="Beige bathroom door with handle and beige wall tiles and steel towel hanger before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-02-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-02-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: One of the most important aspects of the renovation was the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timeline</a>. They came <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/21459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back to Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted contractors, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found their general contractor</a>. “We have this baby coming. Please, please don’t let there be construction going on when we have a baby,” Daniel recalled saying. Their Sweeten contractor understood the tight timeframe and kept the project moving, finishing a month before baby Adrian arrived.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">The radiator dilemma was a key feature that Kate and Daniel’s Sweeten contractor helped to resolve. At one point, there was a complicated plan to rerun the steam pipe so the radiator could be installed on the floor. However, the contractor guided them toward removing the radiator altogether. The risky decision was a winner, with the rest of the apartment generating enough heat to keep the bathroom warm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fixing the water temperature issue was another unknown. The problem could have been in the wall of the bathroom or elsewhere in the building. Thankfully, it turned out to be inside the wall. “Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/shower-heads-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">water temperature control</a> is so beautiful, I feel like I am in a hotel,” said Daniel.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the aesthetic, the couple spent a lot of time on <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/sweetenhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest</a>. They went with <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-popular-bath-tiles-and-how-much-they-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">classic subway tile</a> for the walls and hexagonal tile in a royal blue colorway for the floor. Salvaged redwood planks along the bathtub added some warmth. The gold fixtures were an effort to mimic the brass found throughout the rest of the apartment.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: While on a trip to Puebla, Mexico, a few years ago, the couple bought a box of hand-painted tiles with no real purpose in mind. When Kate and Daniel’s Sweeten contractor proposed a nook in the shower for soap, they were able to incorporate some of the tiles into the design.</p>
