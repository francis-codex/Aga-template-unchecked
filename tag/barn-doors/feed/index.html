<h3>Remodel a basement bathroom for a welcome upgrade</h3>
<p>I love my Arlington Ridge neighborhood with its hilly streets and access to the metro, my favorite Mexican restaurant, and grocery store. When I found the 2,000-square-foot 1950s Virginia ranch home, I fell for the windows, cathedral kitchen, glass porch, and spacious yard. My older sister, Missy, deciding to move from San Francisco back to the East Coast, was a perfect excuse to renovate. She asked to use my downstairs as her temporary home.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48731 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="basement bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p>Before we renovated this (almost) windowless basement bathroom, it was creepy and unwelcoming. The shower had a horrible wall partitioning it off from the rest of the room. The door opened to a full view of the toilet. We never used it. I wanted an open-plan bathroom with plenty of light—a room that guests wouldn’t be scared to use when they visited me in Arlington.</p>
<p>I went into this as a first-time renovator. My biggest question was: Will it be a huge interruption in my workday? I work in business development, so I am on Zoom a lot. We posted our project on Sweeten and we could not have been happier with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woman-owned general contractor</a> we selected.</p>
<h3>Behind the not-so-pleasing wall</h3>
<p>When the contractor removed the wall, she discovered a very vintage pipe system that needed replacement. We looked for a plumbing specialist, and that search set us back a couple of days. Meanwhile, our contractor took the room down to the studs so the plumber could install new piping. The job involved breaking the foundation concrete, but even on days when the jackhammers were out or the water had to be turned off, we had advanced warning.</p>
<h3>Expanding the design palette</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48732" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="Arlington bath remodel" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>My Sweeten contractor made the job seamless and easy, even though what I initially envisioned changed dramatically. I thought I wanted the bathroom all white and clean but decided instead to let this room give the downstairs character. When she proposed the sliding glass barn door as a shower enclosure, I was sold.</p>
<p>The vanity is another fantastic piece, not only for its look but for the storage it brought to the room. I never would have guessed I would <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pick the gray shower floor</a>, but it all came together and it works.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span>&#8220;My contractor was really helpful&#8230;providing the right resources and materials. I understood what to expect throughout the process&#8230;&#8221;</span>

<h3>A beautiful result, and a satisfying experience</h3>
<p>I wanted a modern bathroom to match the rest of the house—and my future renovation plans—and I really lucked out. My contractor was really helpful, connecting with my sister and me and providing the right resources and materials. I understood what to expect throughout the process, and we are both so happy with how the bathroom turned out. Missy, a former tech executive, now works as a startup advisor. She is really enjoying the new digs.</p>

<p>Throughout the process, my contractor’s crew was amazing. My one-year-old beagle, Callie, would shake with excitement when they arrived, play for ten minutes, and then allow them to work. She returned throughout the day to check progress and get head scratches.</p>
<p>My Sweeten general contractor answered my questions, updated me on changes, and discussed any challenges. The team was respectful of my space, too. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">covered the downstairs areas</a> to keep them as clean as possible and left the workspace tidy. I scored with a respectful and professional contracting group that made my rip-and-replace renovation run smoothly, even as I worked from home. I always knew what to expect the next day.</p>

<h3>After a remodel, a basement bathroom has real appeal</h3>
<p>Missy’s gorgeous bathroom is now my favorite thing to show off in the house. It inspired her, too. She recently sold her house and is thinking about where she—and her Aussiedoodle, Ellie—should buy next. New, modern, and clean&#8230;what an upgrade.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Slide right into a more flexible living space with these renovations</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Walls and doors are losing popularity in the era of open-plan living, but what if you could have the best of both worlds? Imagine a space that is open to the rest of your home—or closed off—depending on your mood. Enter the sliding door: a feature that takes up minimal floor space and blends into its surroundings when not in use, becoming an architectural detail in the home. Whether you prefer the rustic feel of a barn or the simple elegance of French doors, these Sweeten homeowners will inspire you to create a home with disappearing borders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-31.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33691 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-barn-door-white-living-room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-31.gif" alt="white barn door in a white living room with wooden floor after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A classic barn door separates the living room from the bedroom in Zoe and Arvid&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment combination</a>. Painting the door white to match the nearby walls allows it to blend into the background, while black hardware adds contrast with a modern twist.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-34-35.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25786 mb-0 size-chrono" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-36-38.gif" alt="sliding doors, office doors, natural light " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While not in use as an entryway, a pair of sliding doors gives Larry the option to watch a game on the TV in the adjoining lounge from inside his <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-renovation-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">office</a>. The doors also increase the flow of natural light into the windowless room.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-15-16.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25014 mb-0 size-chrono" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-15-16.gif" alt="sliding doors, open floor plan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sliding doors in Ana and Leo&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/general-contractors-dream-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-plan apartment</a> connect the dining area to the office when open, and transform the office into a guest bedroom when closed. In lieu of a traditional door, the oversized panels allow them to combine both rooms into one big space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-09-10.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22102 mb-0 size-chrono" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-09-10.gif" alt="sliding doors, open space, privacy " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Replacing a barn door with three store-bought doors together in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/food-writer-uses-hotel-inspired-style-art-deco-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dining area</a> (and painting it in the same color as the surrounding walls—Hamilton Blue by Benjamin Moore) makes it possible for Lauren and Ross to hide the study when they want to create a more intimate space.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-nyc-homecoming-prompts-a-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flexible living space</a>, Margery and Jim planned to separate the guest bedroom from the kitchen with a pair of sliding doors. Instead of going for a simple set of barn-style doors, the couple&#8217;s general contractor fused together two salvaged French doors the couple found at an estate sale and built them into a pocket door. When opened, the entire wall disappears. Magic!</p>
