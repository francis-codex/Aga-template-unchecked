										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Set your bathing experience with a wide range of shower heads to satisfy every mood, style, and budget</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26484 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spa shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped-723x482.jpg" alt="shower heads" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What’s your preferred method of bathing? If like most Americans, it’s the shower, then you probably have a showering style. But it may not be the same for all the members of your family. Perhaps you like a gentle relaxing wash, while your partner prefers a bracing, wake-me-up experience. Maybe the type of spray depends on the day. Good news: Many shower heads include adjustable features that let you select the spray pattern and the intensity of the water flow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s a lot to consider. As you narrow down the selection, a few factors play first into your decision:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*The type of shower experience</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*The size of the shower</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*The style of your bathroom</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Experience:</strong> If you’re going through the trouble to replace the head, or remodel your bath entirely, consider thoughtfully how you shower. What’s the most important function for you? Rinsing off after a workout? Soothing tired muscles? Unwinding with some water therapy? Many manufacturers today offer features that allow you to get a custom luxury experience at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Size:</strong> Take into account, too, the dimensions of the shower. If it’s big enough for two, you may want twin shower heads, or one adjustable and one fixed. Or you may indulge in an oversize rain shower centered overhead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Style:</strong> Take into account your bath décor. Whether your look is traditional or contemporary, you can find a shower head to suit the space. However, most of the new products tend toward the sleek and straight-lined, which may not suit a Victorian-style bathroom.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24334 size-chrono" title="shower panel with rainfall and waterfall features" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-18-723x1085.jpg" alt="shower heads" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<h3>Shower head fixture options</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even a simple, inexpensive shower head can provide a satisfying shower, but a higher price point provides more options. Here’s a rundown of the types of shower heads you’ll find as you shop. (Note: Check with your contractor before your final selection. You need to be sure your home’s plumbing can handle the model you want, particularly if you choose to install more than one.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Single-head:</strong> The simplest go-to style, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/molly-bathroom-renovation-ditmas-park/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-head</a> is attached to the wall at the height you determine and then it stays there. Some models come with an adjustable shank so you can tip the head higher or lower or side-to-side, as you wish. You can find this version with one or multiple spray modes, from concentrated to mist and even pulsating, which can be adjusted with a lever or a twirl of an encircling ring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Handheld:</strong> Attached to flexible tubing, this <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/home-improves-view-inside/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower head</a> can be moved to spray wherever you want, including rinsing down walls after cleaning the shower stall. When not in use, this type hooks into a wall-mounted cradle or onto a slide bar that lets it glide up and down on the wall. Either installation method allows it to be used as a fixed shower head. This is a great option for its versatility and convenience. It also benefits a shared shower with bathers of different heights or a person who may need to be seated when showering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dual-head:</strong> As the term indicates, this style offers two shower heads, one fixed and one handheld. Another <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combo</a> could be a rain shower head and a handheld. A single set of levers or handles controls temperature, but a diverter valve can allow the bather to operate one or the other shower head, or both, at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rain shower head:</strong> This <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fixture</a> comes round or square in shape. The face is flat and large and fitted with many small holes through which water flows to simulate a rainstorm. The water flow is typically gentle, and best suited to a soothing experience than to routines like washing and rinsing hair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Shower systems:</strong> More elaborate than a dual-head arrangement, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower system</a> typically comprises multiple shower head components including a rain shower head, a hand shower, body sprays, and misters, to achieve an ultra-luxurious spa experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26567 size-chrono" title="rain shower head" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="shower heads" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<h3>Spray patterns</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shower heads come with a single spray mode, or with multiple functions, like these popular water works:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*Full-body spray: a full, even stream of water for daily bathing</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*Massage or pulsating spray: emitting a pulsating stream of water tension</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*Soft aerated: mixing air and water to provide a gentle flow</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*Needle: a fine yet penetrating spray</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of these shower heads will also include settings that let you toggle between wide and narrow water flow. Some manufacturers will go up to 12 settings with varying intensities and combos of the above-described modes. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24008 size-chrono" title="black matte shower fixtures" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg" alt="shower heads" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
</span></p>
<h3>Fixture finishes</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just like your sink faucet, you can expect a vast array of finishes—brushed or polished chrome, brushed or polished nickel, stainless steel, brushed or oil-rubbed bronze, polished or antique brass, as well as baked-on enamel or epoxy finishes that come in a few colors, most commonly black or white.</p>
<p>Manufacturers also boast finishes that resist water spots, particularly an issue if your water is hard, but polished finishes will still require attention with a soft cloth to keep that mirror-like appearance.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Charles_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26482 size-chrono" title="handheld shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Charles_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="shower heads" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<h3>Saving water</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All shower heads made today are required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to emit water at a flow of no more than 2.5 gallons per minute (GPM). Look for the WaterSense label, a program from the EPA that certifies shower components that use no more than 2 GPM, or 20 percent less than the 2.5 GPM requirement. The program also covers standards of performance, so a WaterSense product should offer a satisfying shower experience. Another benefit: In addition to conserving a precious natural resource, you’ll save on your utility bills, including the water heater.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A shower head may be small, but it packs a lot of power in its compact form to give you the bathing experience you want in any given moment. Choose wisely, and enjoy the soothing, rejuvenating, invigorating results. You deserve it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Shower systems offer spa-like luxury, from multi-functional showerheads to a steam shower and chromotherapy</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25648 size-chrono" title="shower systems" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg" alt="shower systems" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><em>(Above) Leslie&#8217;s renovation with Sweeten resulted in a separate room for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full shower system</a> including a steam shower, rain showerheads and jet sprays</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Americans have become highly sophisticated about their renovation choices and preferences. And nowhere is this more evident than in the bath. Homeowners count on their bathrooms to help them rev up in the morning and wind down in the evening. Manufacturers now create elaborate shower systems that provide a luxurious shower experience. Here, Sweeten&#8217;s guide to modern shower systems outlines popular features and add-ons, with tips on adding one into your bathroom remodel plans.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Design to go with the flow</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s begin with the layout. Shower systems should be isolated, almost like a room, and shouldn&#8217;t be part of a tub. While it doesn’t have to be big enough to fit two, there should be enough footage to move around and extend your arms fully. Simple materials and clean lines deliver the best aesthetic to convey a feeling of serenity. This means frameless glass doors and a floor-level shower tray. (Bonus: It’s fully accessible!) A built-in bench, particularly if the shower is clad in <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stone</a>, adds another luxurious touch. Make sure you assess your plumbing capacity to be sure it can supply sufficient volume pressure. Your water heater must also be ready if you include a steam shower or body jets. (These features often operate at the same time as the shower.) Ensure your contractor evaluates the drain so it evacuates all that water quickly. Next, you&#8217;ll want to plan your shower system features!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Luxury shower system options</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luxury shower systems in the home go way beyond simple showerheads, even one with diverse spray patterns. The typical luxury shower system is a combination of individual features that come as a unit in a panel, or those you choose individually. You&#8217;ll want a shower head with several spray patterns, a hand shower on a wall-mount slide bar, and several pairs of body jets (six to eight are common). This arrangement should come with a thermostatic diverter that controls the water temperature to a preset degree. This means you don’t have to fiddle with it each time you turn it on.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Shower panels</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a few hundred dollars, you can find an all-in-one shower panel at a box store such as Home Depot. (This is at least half of what you would spend on a shower system of individual components.) The panel includes a showerhead, two to eight body jets, and an adjustable hand shower. Advantageously, a shower panel provides quick installation at a price that fits most budgets. The disadvantage: the panel mounts to the wall, extending several inches into the shower space. If you want a sleeker look, you will need to go with individual components that recess into the wall. Either way, make sure that your plumbing provides sufficient water pressure for all the features to operate simultaneously. If not, your contractor should make adjustments before installation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rain shower heads</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An increasingly popular type of luxury shower head is the rain shower head. Rain shower heads are preferred for the soothing effect that its name indicates. These luxury-type shower heads can be mounted to the wall and angled to drop directly down, or installed on the ceiling. Look for an extra-wide spray span, as much as 15 inches, and a choice of spray patterns, from gentle to drenching. <a href="https://www.grohe.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grohe</a> and <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler</a> also offer digital controls with their rain shower systems. These controls allow you to preset your favorite spray pattern with your preferred water temperature. You simply push a button to start your shower and enter your specific experience. Kohler developed a showering panel that simulates the varying sizes and angles of raindrops as they fall, for a fully sensory occurrence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you really want to splurge, you can get a shower panel installed in the ceiling that will shower you with several spray patterns simultaneously. This requires special framing for the ceiling, so you need to plan this feature before you start your renovation.</p>

<h3>Body sprays</h3>
<p>These components allow for water therapy that hits every inch of your body to soothe or stimulate. Surface-mounted or recessed, the sprays are typically installed in pairs. Pay careful attention to placement, particularly if people of varying heights will use the shower. Swivel body sprays can help for minor adjustments. The top-level jets target the shoulders, the middle, the waist or hips, and the lowest, the thighs or knees. Some jets pop out when in operation, then retract when the water is turned off. You can find these sprays in the classic faucet and showerhead finishes—chrome, nickel, bronze, polished or brushed—and in square or round shapes from most major manufacturers including <a href="https://www.americanstandard-us.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Standard</a>, Kohler, <a href="https://www.hansgrohe-usa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hansgrohe</a>, Grohe, <a href="https://www.deltafaucet.com/bathroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delta</a>, and <a href="https://www.moen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moen</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Steam</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Technological advances have made it possible to bring the coveted spa experience of steam into modern homes. The operation appears simple: steam is emitted by heads installed on the shower wall, and operated by a control pad programmed for temperature and session length. However, you will need to plan with your contractor to allow for several precautions. Don&#8217;t forget: steam showers generate more moisture and heat than a regular shower. As a result, your contractor will first install vapor proofing material to prevent water vapor from seeping through the walls. The shower door should be airtight, too, so water doesn’t escape to create mildew on wallpaper and paint. The ceiling should be curved so that condensed vapor droplets run down the walls, instead of dripping on you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For operation, a steam shower requires a generator and a ventilation unit. Both of these features are concealed from sight. Accordingly, your contractor can help you to determine the best, most effective placement for each. Alternatively, you can buy a stand-alone steam shower, complete with rain shower, hand shower, massage jets, whirlpool tub, steam generator, and LED lighting. Companies that specialize in steam showers, as well as major manufacturers like Kohler or <a href="https://www.whirlpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whirlpool</a>, offer many choices. If you don&#8217;t want to go the custom route, a two-person unit will cost you about $2,000. If you are creating a custom steam shower, expect your costs to double, to about $4,000. For either route: work with a contractor to ensure properly-installed plumbing and electricity.</p>

<h4>Seating for shower systems</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When planning to introduce a steam shower to your bathroom, plan for it to be big enough for at least two people to use. Also, allow footage for a bench for lounging and even reclining.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Chromotherapy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know that humans crave the healing power of light based on our innate need for sunlight and full-spectrum light in wintertime. You can isolate the individual colors that make up full-spectrum for healing effects in the bath. This is called chromotherapy. You’ll want at least four <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lights</a> installed in your shower ceiling for even illumination. You can find LED versions in primary colors, and connect them to a separate switch in the shower. Amazon sells chromotherapy bulbs in seven colors—orange, red, blue, aqua, indigo, green, and yellow. You can change them at will, or set them to cycle through all the colors. Make sure your contractor adds a dimming capability. You can also choose a chromotherapy package made to go with a tub or steam shower enclosure from a manufacturer.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Adding music to your shower system</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once upon a time, you set your radio on the counter to listen to news and music. Kohler is among a handful of manufacturers that lets you bring music right into the shower. They offer a shower head with a wireless speaker that you can connect to your phone with Bluetooth® technology. The speaker docks in the center of the showerhead when in use, and is removable for recharging the battery, which lasts up to seven hours. The showerhead is available as a wall-mount or rain shower. Grohe also makes a rechargeable wireless speaker that attaches to the slide bar of the hand shower. For under $100, you can opt for wireless Bluetooth® speakers, compatible with most smartphones, that attach to the wall by suction cups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to the bathroom, it makes sense that your shower should provide the personalized experience you seek. By adding one or all of the features described above, you can luxuriate in your favorite spa rituals every day without leaving home.</p>
