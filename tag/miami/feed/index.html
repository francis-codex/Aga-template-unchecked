			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">From kitchens and home offices to outdoor spaces</span><span class="s2">, the top Miami home remodeling trends point to function, customization, and color</span></h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_design_trends_Ken_Hayden.jpg" alt="A balcony in Miami with a water view" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52441" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_design_trends_Ken_Hayden.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_design_trends_Ken_Hayden-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_design_trends_Ken_Hayden-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Miami, homeowners are increasingly drawing their design inspiration from color and nature. At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve observed how these themes inform the most popular Miami home remodeling trends. It&#8217;s clear that h</span><span class="s1">omeowners are rethinking both aesthetics and function, indoors and out. In this guide, Sweeten shares popular home remodeling design trends in The Magic City.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in Renovation Financial Protection—for free.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Home remodeling projects in Miami are robust. “They’re putting money into their homes,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6382#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami-based Sweeten contractor Adrian</a>. “They see it as an investment.” </span><span class="s1">Adrian said that much of his remodeling work has less to do with adding square footage. It’s more about reconfiguring—taking away and adding walls, refreshing appliances, and fixtures.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Kitchen trends for functional and style</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Consistently close to the top of the remodeling project list in Miami is the </span><span class="s2">kitchen</span><span class="s1">. “It’s the heart of the home,” said <a href="https://samrobin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami-based interior designer Sam Robin</a>. “My philosophy about it hasn’t changed much. If I entertain 100 people in my home, they’ll all end up in the kitchen.” With the kitchen serving as both a functional <em>and</em> fashionable space, Miami homeowners are upgrading the room to work hard and look appealing. Below, Sweeten lists the go-to updates Miami homeowners are requesting for their kitchens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="gray-bathroom-with-gold-hardware" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52385" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Upgrading kitchen appliances</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So many renovation plans include updating and re-prioritizing the styles and functions of appliances. The nationwide trend is toward cooking with wellness in mind, so steam ovens are becoming more prevalent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Induction cooktops are catching on (“absolutely, very trendy,” said Adrian. Sam said she still prefers gas ranges.)</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Flexible room design</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kitchens opening to a great room are still popular, with cabinets that look more furniture-like. But there’s definitely a move to closing off larger spaces when desired. Sliding, French, and barn-style doors do the trick.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kitchen islands are being more defined by function, so Sam has specified double islands for some clients. Multi-level counters also are trending. The varying heights allow for different functions.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">An organic look: Natural materials </span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the overall look in the kitchen, designer Sam said there’s a trend to more organic, more natural materials. It’s all about changes in textures. Graphic backsplashes include porcelain, terra cotta, or concrete tiles. These can be earthy or bold color combinations or monochromatic tone-on-tone patterns like herringbone.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s a big trend toward more rustic simplicity, like <i>wabi sabi</i>,” she said, such as cement walls or concrete flooring and countertops. It’s a real organic living space.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Here are some other top Miami home remodeling trends in the kitchen:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Simple, flat-panel cabinetry. Lacquer finishes mostly have given way to matte.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Farm-style and trough sinks are on the rise.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Wide-planked floors (seven inches wide is average), such as light rift-cut oak or dark wenge.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Statement lighting. Shapes include large scale globes, square-shaped, or linear fixtures, especially over countertops</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Metal hardware. Burnished brass still is trending as well as black matte. Sometimes they’re seen in the same room.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2.jpg" alt="Marble bathroom with white double floating vanity" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52388" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Bath trends for utility and statement materials</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor Adrian has seen freestanding sculptural soaking tubs remain strong in Miami. However, many homeowners are preferring freestanding showers. Features like aromatherapy and steam showers are gaining traction. That’s especially true in luxury condos. <em>(For more info, see <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/miami-condo-renovations-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten&#8217;s Guide to Remodeling a condo in Miami.</a>)</em></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In larger homes in Miami Beach, bigger master baths are open to the master bedrooms. Adrian has installed barnyard-style doors, 6-feet wide (and wider, when more privacy is preferred.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The top Miami home remodeling trends in the bathroom:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Floating vanities with integrated stone tops and storage drawers.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Stone and porcelain featuring dramatic veining that can be book-matched on statement walls.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Touchless toilets and motion-activated faucets are desirable wellness/hygiene features.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Multiple sources of lighting &#8211; Sam said while it’s important to include downlights, lighting around vanities (usually sconces) is important so that shadows aren’t created.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Wallpaper, especially with tropical themes, palm trees, or foliage, is very popular in powder rooms.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Outdoor space as an extension of the home</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bringing indoor style and all of their comforts outdoors is a goal. No matter what the style, the connection from indoors to out cannot be denied. “We have such an inside-outside vernacular,” said interior designer Sam. “We want to merge it because of a gorgeous landscape. It’s like having a painting in every room.”</span><span class="s3"> Outdoor kitchens feature commercial-style grills, refrigerators, and wine coolers. Fireplaces or fire pits and water features add to the ambiance.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1.jpg" alt="A stone walkway with palm trees in Miami" width="1000" height="1363" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52390" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1-220x300.jpg 220w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1-600x818.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Coral was repurposed for a walkway and retaining wall by designer Sam Robin. Photo by Ken Hayden.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve been doing large terraces,” said Sam. “And getting into more hardscaping, like paving materials. There’s a lot of wood, like ipe, a tropical hardwood that withstands the elements. Other materials for the outdoor space include travertine with grass in between, microcement, Keystone coral, and big boulders to create ponds. We’re creating spectacular views, framed by foliage.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Indoor rooms opening up to terraces with a series of French doors or doors that fold back is another way to connect with the outside.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Home offices get a makeover</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sam also has gotten a lot of requests for home offices—homeowners are trading kitchen counters for more professional dedicated spaces.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Clients want a good back wall, appropriate for video meetings,” said Sam. “Something more professional looking, with style. They also want space for the kids to focus with computers and homework. Not just a playroom for a bunch of Legos.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sam said that allocating space for a home office often involves a reset of function. For example, sitting rooms off of bedrooms or smaller family rooms are converted. Guest rooms also do double duty, with sleepers and desks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“And there’s creative storage,” said Sam. “Closets can be transformed into storage file systems with nice millwork, which can be opened up (when needed) instead of having a separate room. It depends on personal preference.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some even opt for more than one home office; the addition appears to be boosting resale value, even with a modest investment.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Miami home remodeling trends: Design details in the home</span></h3>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Impressing guests <em>and</em> personally savoring spaces</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Homeowners are investing money in renovation details that are big and small—all of which make an impact on daily living. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rolling bar carts make way for built-in cabinetry which holds wet bars, undercounter refrigeration, freezer, and wine coolers. “My clients all want wine rooms,” said Sam.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3.jpg" alt="Home office with white and beige striped wallpaper" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52389" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sam Robin designed a home office in a bedroom for a pair of teens; painted stripes on the wall. Photo by Kris Tamburello.</span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other rising design trends in Miami home remodeling:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Wide plank flooring, with an average of seven inches wide, in lighter woods like ash and oak. “It’s a European country vibe,” said Adrian.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Architectural light fixtures in simple modern shapes, linear forms, and organic shapes that feature leaves and tendrils are catching on</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">LEDS are replacing halogens. There’s more accent lighting, like under-cabinet and lighting coves.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Graphic tiles (including for the floor), as well as concrete patterned tiles, are quite popular. Black and white geometrics and heritage Cuban designs are inspirations.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Color palettes include earthy tones (creams and tans), blue and white (cobalt to watery blue-green), and vivid bold colors          </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Important structural elements for Miami homes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another important consideration when remodeling in Miami is the threat of hurricanes. </span><span class="s2">Building codes</span><span class="s1"> are strict because of that. Concrete pillars, rebar and steel-reinforced walls, roof trusses and bracing roofs, and hurricane-resistant windows all are part of the conversation. <em>(</em></span><em><a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/how-to-prepare-your-house-for-hurricanes-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten&#8217;s guide to Preparing Homes for Hurricanes</a>.)</em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are no water restrictions, however, as there are in California. But because of Miami&#8217;s wet climate, materials need to be mold and mildew-proof.</span></p>
<h4>Finding the right general contractor for a Miami home remodel</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miamians are personalizing more while remodeling their homes. In their budgets and work scopes, homeowners ensure there’s more room for a little drama. Bringing these types of specific design plans to life successfully requires an expert general contractor, and architect or design team. Are you looking for general contractor experts near you?

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Whether you own a modern beach-side condo, an on-the-bay house, or a bungalow away from it all on a quiet street, the process of doing a remodel in Miami can be enjoyable—with a rewarding outcome. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A budget is the start of any renovation, and every project is unique: from materials, adding value and lifestyle to your home, and working with the HOA.<span class="s2"> </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span class="s3">Sweeten</span></a>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their project, offers this cost guide to remodeling in Miami to provide a jumping-off point to get you on your way. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Remodeling costs per square foot in Miami</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Here’s a breakdown of the typical </span>costs to remodel in Miami, <span class="s1">Florida. The costs are across five categories: full home, kitchen, bathroom, deck additions, and permits. These figures are compiled from Sweeten general contractors and <i>Remodeling</i>’s<a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2021/"><span class="s3"> Cost vs. Value Report</span></a>:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Full home renovation:<b> </b>Starting at <b>$100 &#8211; $250+ </b>per square feet (psf) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen remodel: starting at <b>$150</b> psf or <b>$15,000</b> (based on 100 sq ft) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$325</strong> psf or <strong>$32,500</strong> (based on 100 sq ft) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen remodel: Staring at <strong>$650</strong> psf or <strong>$65,000</strong> (based on 100 sq ft) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Budget bathroom remodel: Starting at <b>$300</b> psf or <strong>$10,500</strong> (based on 35 sq ft) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Starting at <b>$570</b> psf or <b>$19,950</b> (based on 35 sq ft) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">High-end bathroom remodel: Starting at <b>$630</b> psf or <b>$22,050</b> (based on 35 sq ft) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Basic wood deck addition: <b>$40</b> psf or <b>$13,000</b> (based on 325 sq ft) </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Concrete patio addition with roof, electrical, plumbing, and a cooking area: <b>$50,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Keep in mind that every professional contractor will want to have a detailed conversation with you. They will also inspect your home before developing an estimate specific to your needs and wants.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up and your material order starts at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h3 class="p6">How much does it cost to remodel a home in Miami?</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you’re renovating a house in the Miami area, expect costs to range from <b>$100</b> to <b>$250+</b> psf with <b>$175</b> psf as the middle range for a full-scale remodel. If you&#8217;re aiming for a budget that is in the upper-middle-range, Miami-based<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6382#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">Sweeten general contractor Adrian</span></a> said you can expect to pay over <b>$200,000</b> or about <b>$200</b> psf. However, several elements affect this, like square footage, the state of the original home, and how expensive your tastes are. &#8220;It has all to do with the finishes,” Adrian said. By finishes, he means the elements you can see such as tiles, faucets, and kitchen countertops. With materials, plan to add to the timeline for installation and materials and labor costs. Using higher-end finishes will push your budget upwards by at least $50,000, he said. With the pandemic, material and labor costs have gone up due to higher demand. “There’s been a 20 percent in materials,” said Adrian.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The budget for renovating an apartment can be higher than house renovations. “If you’re doing a house, often you can work on the weekends,” said Adrian. In a condo, there are tight rules about when construction work can and can’t be done. These hours are put in place by the<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/a-guide-to-an-hoa-before-you-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">homeowners association</span></a> (HOA) for each building. Often, this means only working within an eight-hour or so window Monday to Friday. This extends the timeline of a project, thus increasing the budget. HOAs might also charge a condo owner a fee to remodel their apartment. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Disposing of trash adds to the cost of condo renovations. With a house, a general contractor can park a dumpster out the front. For condo remodels, general contractors will likely hire a separate contractor to come and lug construction trash away. This involves negotiating tight hallways and elevators as well as timeframes given by the HOA.  </span></p>
<h3 class="p6">How much does it cost to remodel a kitchen in Miami?</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">A kitchen renovation in the budget value range can come in starting at <strong>$150</strong> psf or <b>$15,000</b> for a space measuring around 100 square feet, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6366#overview"><span class="s3">Hancen, a Sweeten general contractor</span></a> in Miami. To get a new kitchen at this price, it needs to be a rip-and-replace job, meaning a layout of the kitchen must stay the same with pipes and appliances remaining where they are. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Homeowners should look at materials like pre-made shaker-style cabinets and appliances from big-box stores like Home Depot. “I’ve also noticed a trend for concrete countertops,” said Hancen. “These can be cheaper than quartz, but they take more to maintain,” adding that a sealant needs to be applied annually. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">For a mid-grade kitchen remodel in Miami, Sweeten has seen costs starting at <strong>$325</strong> psf or <strong>$32,500</strong> for a 100-square-foot room. According to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report, a mid-range kitchen remodel costs on average<b> $73,645</b>. This works out to <b>$368</b> psf for a 200-square foot space. Almost 54 percent of that cost is recouped in the value it adds to a home. The example kitchen the report gave was 200 square feet with laminate countertops, semi-custom wood cabinets, and a stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet. It also contained a built-in microwave, dishwasher, and custom lighting. Other than the addition of a kitchen island, the layout, such as where the oven and dishwasher were installed, remained the same as the original design. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6512#overview">Sweeten general contractor Domenico</a></span><span class="s1">, also servicing Miami, recently completed a kitchen renovation in this price range. It included a countertop made from Dekton, a stain-, scratch-, heat-, and UV-resistant material. The cabinets were custom with self-closing doors, which took <b>$40,000</b> from the budget. The appliances were from GE. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Sweeten has seen high-end kitchen renovations in Miami start at <strong>$650</strong> psf or <strong>$65,000</strong> for a 100-square-foot space. The 2021 Cost Vs Value Report quotes <b>$145,718</b> for this finish level, adding the same amount of value to a home’s resale value—50 percent—as a mid-range kitchen remodel. This included custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported ceramic or glass tile backsplashes. The appliances were also upgraded, including a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood, plus designer faucets and a water filtration system. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p6">How much does it cost to remodel a bathroom in Miami?</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">At the budget level, expect a solid rip-and-replace bathroom with no behind-the-wall surprises to come in starting at <b>$10,500</b> for a 35-square-foot room. Contractor Hancen specializes in bathrooms for the Miami area. He has completed a very basic 50-square-foot bathroom for <b>$300</b> psf, he said. However, this is contingent on the layout staying the same and having no issues like leaks or mold discovered once the project begins. If you’re after this price, stick to a prefabricated vanity and ceramic tiles, which come out to about <b>$2</b> psf. When it comes to faucets, toilets, and bathtubs, the brand American Standard is a good example of affordable, quality products. “These are the most well-priced materials I’ve seen and the most popular,” said Hancen. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">The next step up is a mid-grade bathroom renovation. Expect the starting costs for this finish level to be <strong>$570</strong> psf or <strong>$19,950</strong> based on a 35-square-foot space. According to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report, the average cost for this type of bathroom remodel in Miami is about <b>$22,567</b> and about <b>$644</b> psf. The example bathroom the report gave was a 5’ x 7’ space and involved installing a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a lit and recessed medicine cabinet. A renovation in this vein can add about <b>$12,051</b> to a home’s value. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">A high-end bathroom remodel in the Miami area starts at <strong>$630</strong> psf or <strong>$22,050</strong> for a 35-square-foot space. According to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report, the average price in this category is around <b>$70,286</b>. For this budget, you could expand your bathroom to around 100 square feet and can play around with elements like a freestanding soaker tub and a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. You’re also likely to afford a double sink and double-mirror vanity with custom drawers, and wall cabinets. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The cost of tiles can add up. On a recent project, Domenico’s client picked out a tile that had the appearance of wood and cost <b>$20</b> psf. Another client wanted a wave pattern created out of tiles. “It was more difficult to install adding to the labor costs,” he said. “Occasionally, breakages happen, so that also needs to be covered.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The good news is this is an investment with about 48 percent of the budget added to your home’s sale price. </span></p>
<h3 class="p6"><span class="s1">Adding outdoor space to your home</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Florida, there is plenty of sun and enviable weather to take advantage of by renovating or adding an outdoor space to your home. Many Miami residents will use these spaces as an additional living space and even kitchen. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">For one project, Sweeten contractor Adrian added a 900 square foot patio to a house that had a budget of <b>$50,000</b>. “It was essentially another room to the house without the walls,” he said. It had a tiled roof supported by four columns, which was necessary so the structure could withstand a powerful hurricane. The flooring was Cuban tiles and there were fans and lighting so electrical work was required. </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">According to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report, a 16&#8242;</span> x 20&#8242;  wood deck costs <strong>$15,216</strong> and <strong>$20,879</strong> for a composite one in the Miami area. <span class="s1">If you went for a simple wood deck in a simple linear pattern, you could recoup close to 67 percent of the budget in the bump it gives to your home value. For this price, you could get a built-in bench and planter with stairs and railings. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1"></ul>
<h3 class="p6"><span class="s1">Permit costs in Miami</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The cost of permits, from a typical building permit to electrical, mechanical, and plumbing permits, are calculated in<span class="s2"> </span><a href="https://www.miamidade.gov/permits/library/fees/building-fee-schedule.pdf"><span class="s3">different ways</span></a>. Some permit costs are calculated by square footage. Some are calculated by the value of a project so an exact figure can take some time to figure out. That’s why general contractor Adrian puts an estimate in the initial budget. For example, with a <b>$250,000</b> renovation, he puts a budget placeholder of <b>$1,500</b> for the main building permit with an additional <b>$500</b> each for plumbing, electrical and mechanical, if the project requires it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Miami-Dade county covers a huge amount of land and almost three million people. Each city—such as Miami South and Miami Lakes—in the county has a building official who issues permits for projects located within that city’s jurisdiction. Residential permits typically take 30 business days to process. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">These Miami remodeling costs are a launchpad so you can begin creating an initial budget. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten’s Renovation Checklist</a> is a downloadable<span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">roadmap to organize</span> all of the moving parts of a renovation.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">An outline from permits to building requirements for condo remodeling Miami</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45354 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog.jpg" alt="A brand new condo remodeling Miami" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">City of Miami building permits </span></h3>
<p><span class="s1">Are you considering condo remodeling in Miami? While renovating a condo is usually a more limited proposition than renovating a house, Sweeten offers guidelines on a few special considerations you’ll need to take into account.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">First,</span><span class="s1"> you will need to obtain the proper city and building approvals before beginning your project. Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6622#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miami contractor Sandra</a>, who is based in Miami, tells us, “The typical process takes about 4-8 weeks for a mid-sized project. [Usually,] the office management has pretty much the same requirements as the city.” You must apply first to the city, and once the city approves the permit, the information is submitted to the management office for the condo. The most common permits required in a condo remodeling Miami project are </span><span class="s1">floor soundproofing, plumbing, electrical, and framing.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Building requirements </span></h3>
<p>In addition to obtaining city permits, many new building projects must also meet new building requirements. You must usually meet and comply with regulations around work hours, rubbish removal, gas installation, and more. Licensed <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/miami-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Miami</a> with experience would be able to navigate any building paperwork and restrictions.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of everything you should be mindful of during your project:</p>
<h4 class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">1) Working hours</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">These are more limited than in a free-standing house. Typically, buildings will permit workers access between the hours of 9AM &#8211; 4PM (occasionally, until 5pm) on weekdays. This translates into shorter working hours. As a result, a condo renovation may take longer than that same project in a house.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">2) Prepping common areas</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Buildings will require workers to protect the common lobby, hallways, and elevators. This needs to be done on a daily basis. Just note, this can keep the GC from working on the actual project on any given day. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">3) Rubbish removal</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">As in all large buildings, trash removal presents a bigger obstacle than in a free-standing house. As Miami-based Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6382#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miami contractor Adrian</a> explains, due to the more protracted process, “the cost of removing the trash is much higher in a condo than in a single-family home.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">The cost for a trash removal service is based on the number of “pulls” it takes to remove debris. According to Adrian’s experience, to remove and replace floor tile in a 1,000-square-foot condo, he estimates it would require four pulls (2-3 for old tile, and one pull for new tile waste). The cost would be around $3,000.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor Sandra concurs: “We spend a lot of time doing this and do it on a daily basis. That means we need to reserve the elevator every time we have to bring it down. We cannot use the building dumpster, so we need to put it in our truck and haul it away.” </span></p>
<h4 class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">4) Altering the slab</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Since even the oldest Miami condos date only back to the ‘50s and ‘60s, they are largely concrete structures. Sweeten contractor Sandra explains, “It is possible but very complex. We would need a structural engineer affidavit and structural plans.” Management will likely be strict about this aspect of the renovation. After all, altering the slab can affect the building&#8217;s other units. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Technically, it is possible to trench or drill to lay plumbing or electrical. However, you would need to prove that you will not compromise the integrity of the slab. Oftentimes, buildings will require “scanning” (via a professional vendor) of the area where the proposed alteration will occur. Sweeten contractor Adrian estimates that it usually costs approximately $600 to scan 100-200 square feet. </span>“If you are going to core drill, the building may not require an engineer to sign off on the alteration,” said Adrian. “But if you are going to trench along the slab then they most certainly will.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h4 class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s3">5) Gas</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4">Most Miami condos feature electric stoves and dryers. That said, gas stoves are becoming slightly more common in new luxury buildings. Our Sweeten contractors do not know of buildings that permit gas dryers. If your condo unit does not currently have a washer/dryer in-unit, there’s a 50/50 chance that it’ll be permitted. Again, this is up to your management company’s rules. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s3">6) Windows</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4"> Due to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-to-prepare-your-house-for-hurricanes-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the seasonal hurricanes</a>, building codes require impact windows. Luckily, this isn’t the responsibility of the individual renovator because windows are typically a building-wide project. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s3">7) Fees</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4">Lastly, expect the management company to charge you a fee for renovating your condo. Just note, these fees are paid in addition to any permit and approval charges. These fees aren&#8217;t unique to Miami, this is standard in condos across the U.S.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, you should have a sense of what to look out for in your Miami condo renovation. </span><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <span class="s2">renovate with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best general contractors in Miami</a></span>.</span></p>

<p>Miami adheres to strict building codes when it comes to hurricane-proof homes. And with good reason. In 2019, the Atlantic Ocean, Miami’s neighbor, produced <a href="https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-hurricanes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18 major storms.</a> Six of those were hurricanes. Below, Sweeten shares the best methods to prepare a house for a hurricane during an exterior renovation.</p>
<p>A hurricane-proof renovation is in the best interest of your biggest investment (your home). New structures in Miami must be able to withstand wind of up to <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article219862625.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">175 miles per hour</a>. That can mean impact windows, additional straps to hold down your roof, and a few other strategies. Sweeten, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, offers a guide on how to prepare a house for a hurricane.</p>
<p>Not only can these standards save your home in a hurricane, but a hurricane-proof exterior renovation can further <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase your home’s value</a>. Homes that go beyond the code to withstand strong hurricanes sell for seven percent more than homes that don’t, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/how-to-build-a-hurricane-resistant-house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s what to consider to prepare a house for a hurricane:</p>
<h3>Impact windows</h3>
<p>Impact windows will be your biggest expense to prepare your house for a hurricane. These specialty windows have multiple layers of silicone-coated glass. The windows are framed by sturdy material such as aluminum. Building codes require homes within a mile of the coast to have impact windows or shutters.</p>
<p>Replacing your windows with something that is hurricane-proof can cost $10,000 to $15,000, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6576#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Jose</a> said. That’s for a two-bedroom house that includes a glass-sliding door. “They aren’t cheap, but in Florida it is normal,” he said. It’s also best to plan ahead, not when a hurricane is on its way. Ordering impact windows can take five or six weeks to arrive, Jose said.</p>
<h3>Panels and shutters</h3>
<p>Shutters and panels that cover your windows during a hurricane are a low-cost alternative to impact windows (of course, you can always do both). The materials typically cost less and so does the installation.</p>
<p>Storm panels are the best value option. You attach them ahead of a hurricane and remove them after. This means a minimal impact to the look of your home. Panels cost between $7 and $8 per square foot, according to <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/weather/hurricane/sfl-hc-shutterguide-htmlstory.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Sun Sentinel. </a>With this option, bolts or tracks are permanently attached around the windows. When a storm is on the way, the homeowner fastens the panels to the bolts or tracks. This takes about 15 minutes per window, according to the Sun Sentinel.</p>
<p>Roller shutters are permanently attached to your home but the installation is incognito until a storm comes. There are a few different styles, but roller shutters are the most common. They cost $30 to $55 per square foot, according to the Sun Sentinel. The shutters hide above the windows all year round. Like a garage door, they are pulled down for a hurricane. It’s easy, and your entire home can be prepped in minutes.</p>
<h3>Reinforced walls</h3>
<p>The benefits of shutters and impact windows are muted if your walls are weak. Older homes can face this issue, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6382#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Adrian</a>. “It is possible the structural support around the doors and windows are not able to handle the wind load,” he said.</p>
<p>An older home built in the 1930s that Adrian worked on had hollow concrete around the doors and windows. To strength those walls, he had to pour concrete into the hollow areas. This added five days to the project timeline and about $3,000 to the budget. However, this is a good practice to consider during an exterior renovation.</p>
<h3>Doors should swing out</h3>
<p>This isn’t a minor issue. Whether your exterior doors swing in or out has a big impact on a hurricane-proof home. Once your exterior —doors or windows— is breached by a storm, it puts pressure on your roof and walls.</p>
<p>Normally, the only thing stopping an exterior door from flying off is the lock and hinge. “If you make the hinges so the door swings outside the home, it gives the door more resistance to wind,” said contractor Adrian. In High-Velocity Hurricane Zones like Miami-Dade county, the building code requires external doors to swing out.</p>
<h3>Fitting roof straps</h3>
<p>Your roof is a vulnerable part of your home in a hurricane. If your roof goes, chances are there won’t be much left of your walls or possessions either. Attaching straps made from galvanized steel between the wall plates and trusses is the most common path to a hurricane-proof home.</p>
<p>Retrofitting an older home with straps is ideally done when you’re already in the throes of an exterior renovation. Adding a new roof could cost $40,000. Adding straps takes up about five percent of that budget, Jose said, “If you’re not redoing your roof, then just adding straps isn’t a simple or cheap process,” he said.</p>
<h3>A hurricane while renovating</h3>
<p>This sounds like a terrible combination, but discuss the details with your contractor. Double-check the logistics if you’re intending to renovate in or around hurricane season, said Jose. Between your existing home insurance and your licensed contractor’s insurance (the keyword <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here is licensed</a>), your home and new materials awaiting to be installed should be covered, according to Sweeten contractor Jose.</p>
<p>As a hurricane approaches, your contractor should be removing or securing materials and packing up tools. Flying debris during a storm needs to be under control.</p>
<p>If the glass has not been installed in the windows, then they will need a plywood cover. A piece can go for as much as $100, according to Jose. “People take advantage of the situation and price gouge,” he said.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of the hurricane, expect your project timeline to extend by a week. The additional time for the project means more costs for dumpster hire, porter potty hire or storage costs, even if there is no damage to the property or materials, Jose said.</p>
<p>The strength and frequencies of big storms are increasing. Hurricane-proofing your home when you are doing a renovation will protect your biggest asset. Sweeten is here to help you navigate this process.</p>
