</ul>
<hr />
<h3>From rental to property owner</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chong and Adam were ready to ditch the small one-bedroom, railroad-style apartment they were renting in Jersey City. Eager to put down more permanent roots, they looked for homes in Fort Lee, NJ—a good midpoint between his work in central New Jersey as a business analyst and her job at a molecular biology lab in Manhattan. They found a 1,090-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bathroom condo on a quiet, pedestrian-friendly street in a well-maintained high-rise built in the &#8217;60s.</p>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chong said that for years she read “with envy the various home blogs and design sites, one of which was Sweeten.” She daydreamed about having her “own home and a kitchen with ample counter space and height-appropriate storage.” She wondered if she would forever store pots and pans in the oven and have to keep a step stool in the kitchen to reach the upper cabinet shelves.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">As soon as they closed on their condo, Chong said, “I posted our condo renovation project to Sweeten and was matched with our contractor. </span>From our first meeting, we were on the same page as to how to bring the unit out of the ’60s and ’80s. We loved his energy and creativity, and also felt assured that Sweeten had done the legwork for us in checking his credentials and reviews of past work.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To maximize planning for their New Jersey condo renovation, they came to the first meeting with lots of ideas. Their contractor, Chong said, “allowed us to make the design decisions while they focused on the nuts and bolts of how to make it all happen. Aesthetically, I favored simple lines with a touch of an industrial feel, and Adam liked warm, traditional finishes.”</p>

<h3>Kitchen drawers make the difference</h3>
<p>The first item on their New Jersey condo renovation checklist was to slightly enlarge the footprint of the kitchen. At about 8’x8’, it was not very large, and a floor-to-ceiling pantry blocked natural light from the living room. In the small footprint, a standard-depth refrigerator made access to the pantry awkward, and there was limited counter space.</p>
<blockquote><p>Adam will say out of the blue, ‘I love our place.’ And I really do, too.</p></blockquote>
<p>They opted to tear down the pantry and put in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peninsula, adding about a foot of space</a> along its length. The peninsula addition forced a change to the kitchen’s entry, so they cut a portion of a hallway wall and redirected some electrical lines and a light switch. Drawers in the peninsula solved storage issues from the loss of the pantry. As a result, they gained easy access to frequently used items, storage for pots and pans, and “most importantly, little use for a step stool,” Chong said.</p>
<p>There was a challenge to the floor plan since the kitchen wasn’t level with the rest of the space; the contractor had to do some research so he could raise the kitchen floor. “He did a great job of making it seamless without the need for any transition pieces,” Chong said.</p>
<h3>Updating the bathrooms</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two bathrooms were easier in terms of design, but the plumbing and electrical changes were more extensive behind the walls. Once the updates were made, the bathrooms came along quickly. The guest bathroom was set in a traditional style, while the master bath would be a little more modern. “We love the minimalist handles and how the handles and the glass doors together make the bathrooms look larger,” Chong said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the rest of the apartment, some of the walls were repaired and plastered with new baseboards and fresh coats of paint were applied. They also removed all of the old carpets and discovered parquet floors. “We liked the original walnut color, so our Sweeten contractor simply screened (removed the old finish without sanding) and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/repair-protect-wood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coated the floors</a> with a satin finish,” Chong said.</p>
<h3>Working with their Sweeten contractor</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their New Jersey condo renovation took about four months from the day they signed a contract with their Sweeten contractor to the date of final inspection. “Considering how he was limited to the work hours and days set by my building’s management, he kept to a good pace,” Chong said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While there were no major surprises or roadblocks, she and Adam moved into the apartment about halfway through the renovation. During their overlap, Chong said, “Our contractor, ever the gentleman, was very accommodating and respectful of our privacy and comfort.” Now, after a few months since the renovation’s completion, “Adam will say out of the blue, ‘I love our place.’ And I really do, too.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Create a more functional kitchen in Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The Park Slope, Brooklyn, homeowner bought her apartment in 2008 knowing it had good bones, great outdoor space (a total score in NYC!), and loads of untapped potential. She’d already renovated the backyard and bathroom before deciding to take on the kitchen, which didn’t have an ideal flow for cooking or entertaining. A wall dividing the kitchen from the living and dining room contained a coat closet taking up valuable space. Armed with ideas on how to make it more practical for storage and cooking,  she <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/21389#before" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project on Sweeten</a>. “I had seen the blog, before-and-after pictures, and write-ups, and thought, &#8216;this is exactly what I need,&#8217;” she said.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: She was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/admin/projects/21389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a> who created 2D and 3D sketches to help her envision the space. They knocked down the walls between the kitchen, dining room, and living room, in addition to removing an overhang (made only of drywall) that made the kitchen feel smaller. All appliances stayed in place except for the refrigerator, which moved to the wall opposite the stove. On her wish list was a place to store cookbooks, a mixer, a ladder, and coats (since the closet was now gone). Her Sweeten contractor doubled the storage with a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peninsula,</a> plus a wall of cabinets surrounding the refrigerator. “My contractor listened to all of my ideas and my wish list, which grew on a daily basis, and incorporated it all into her design seamlessly,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The homeowner and contractor worked together to choose finishes. “When it came to picking a kitchen sink faucet, I went down the rabbit hole of researching it on my own, going to showrooms, and looking at different faucets, I realized the original one my contractor recommended was actually the best of them all.” she admitted. The navy-and-white cabinets, paired with gold hardware, gave the kitchen a classic and contemporary touch.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Open up a small kitchen in a one-bedroom Brooklyn co-op</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Marissa, who has had a “varied career” in theater and finance, purchased the 630-square-foot Prospect Heights co-op in 2012 and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/prospect-heights-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovated the bathroom</a> in 2014 (with Sweeten!). The photo of her bathroom has been saved 7,614 times <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/575616396101361090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Pinterest</a> to date and is Sweeten&#8217;s most saved pin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marissa planned on renovating the kitchen in the spring of 2016, but got married to her then-boyfriend, Jeremy, instead. If they had tried to plan a wedding and do a remodel simultaneously, “we would probably run out of money and, someone—me—was going to have a nervous breakdown coordinating both,” she recounts. So they put the renovation on hold until well after the wedding. They considered renovating based on choices made purely for resale reasons but decided to follow their particular vision instead. “It was going to be way more expensive than a traditional kitchen flip,” she said. “But, in my defense, design is an important part of my life and how often will I get a chance to design a gut-renovated kitchen?”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment hadn’t been renovated since the 100-year-old building became a co-op in the early ‘80s. The kitchen worked, but was dated, lacked storage, and only had 24 square inches of usable counter space. The couple are avid cooks and the kitchen was so cramped, Marissa said, “that we had to instill a rule of only one person allowed in the kitchen at a time—for marital harmony and personal safety.” A raised bar on the peninsula further blocked the kitchen from the living room. “That was a bit isolating for both the cook and the non-cook when all you want to do is reconnect with your spouse after work while prepping dinner,” she explained.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the living room and bedroom walls were dark, the new kitchen needed to be lighter to balance out the space. “I wouldn’t have gone with a white kitchen if I didn’t have the lighting decisions correct, though,” said Marissa, who drew from her background as a theater lighting designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>: With a plan in mind, Marissa and Jeremy <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and chose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“wonderfully communicative” contractor</a>. He helped them get the layered lighting she envisioned, “where I needed it, at color temperatures that I liked, and that I could mix to be flattering so we could pull off a white kitchen. If we should age-in-place and need crazy bright lights one day, we have the ability to turn the kitchen into an airport runway. But for now, a mix of one-half to one-quarter intensity feels just right in our space.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“I sourced, purchased, and refinished the pendants on the peninsula and our contractor allowed me to measure the exact height I wanted them, texting me photos during the installation. He even installed dimmable, under-the-peninsula LED lighting for the cabinets facing the living room so that we can see what’s inside them in spite of the countertop overhang’s shadow!” Marissa loves the ability to control the lighting with such variability and said, “I can match any mood or task I require from it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-14.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33032 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-peninsula-cabinets-open-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-14.gif" alt="white kitchen peninsula with cabinets in an open kitchen and white and purple wall after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly a bad duster—and one with pets—Marissa knew that open shelves instead of upper cabinets, “while super trendy and spacious feeling, just didn’t fit our lifestyle.” With all that open space, she might end up feeling annoyed by not having matching bowls on display. “And I certainly don’t need more things,” Marissa said. “I wanted it to straddle contemporary and traditional style and I feel my design was successful in that regard.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-13.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33031 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-pull-out-drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-13.gif" alt="white kitchen pull out drawers and gold handles after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Metal finishes were mixed to keep them from looking the same. “I went wild with the cabinet hardware. If I have a change of heart later, or a future buyer decides that they don’t like them, it’s an inexpensive and easy swap.” She was careful to use “classic” metals for the more complicated to replace items like the stainless steel appliances and sink, polished nickel faucet, sprayer, and soap dispenser.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33025 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-purple-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-07-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets in a white and purple kitchen with marble countertop and hob" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the antique mirror backsplash, white marble-look quartz peninsula, and white cabinets were part of Marissa’s original plan, she admits the backsplash was a bit of a leap. “While mirrors are best for bouncing light in a space with few windows and making a room appear larger, I wanted an antiqued mirror so as to soften the reflections in it,” she said. For the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a>, there was a discussion about Calacatta Borghini marble, but Jeremy was concerned about upkeep. “I was less concerned because I think lived-in, scuffed up, and even stained marble is beautiful,” Marissa said. The quartz version of the marble look-alike ended up being the same price, easier to source, and less delicate. “We both love how gorgeous and low maintenance the countertops are,”  she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33029 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-custom-kitchen-cabinets-gold-handles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="white custom kitchen cabinets with gold handles and gray floor tiles after renovation " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-11-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-11-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To gain counter space, they got a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer/dryer combo unit</a>. Previously, there was a stacked washer/dryer and a gas dryer vent. “While a gas dryer dries clothes much faster than a ventless dryer, I wanted the extra counter space more than I wanted clothes dried in 20 minutes,” Marissa said. They capped off the gas vent and went long with the back counter. “Now we put in our laundry at night and in the morning it’s dry and we have a nice clear counter above it to fold our clothes before we put them away. It fits our lifestyle.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest challenge they faced was what Marissa calls “‘The Night of a Thousand Terrors, aka Emergency Plumbing Night,’ which ended up doubling our budget overages. We planned for a 20 percent budget overrun but spent closer to 50 percent more, because of that single night.” The demo exposed an unforeseen problem in the walls—pipes running through the middle of the newly expanded kitchen. As planned, it took a plumber three hours to retrofit the pipes into the space they needed to retain the kitchen’s orientation. But once the gas pipe was retrofitted, it was unable to be sealed: the condensation from nearby water pipes prevented the sealing materials from working.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33022 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg" alt="small kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a 16-hour emergency job with three plumbers, they had to shut down the entire apartment stack’s waterline and install drain valves in the basement for every apartment above them just to seal that one gas line (under newer building codes, these would have already been in place). The emergency work ended at 3:00 am and it wasn’t until the next morning that everyone’s water and gas was turned back on. “We sat on the front steps of the building, apologizing in person to all our neighbors who passed by during that horrific evening. We handmade apology cards and sent bottles of wine to all the affected neighbors and found a fun educational game to give to our toddler neighbor. People should build these apology gifts in as line items into their <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a>,” Marissa said. “But in the bigger scheme—our stack of apartments now has drains installed where they should be.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the challenges, Marissa and Jeremy are thrilled with their new kitchen. “I am excited about so many parts of our kitchen that I don’t know if I can pick a favorite!” she said. “I love that we quintupled (or more) our counter space, I love that I can independently control the intensity of all of the lighting in the kitchen, and I love that I can have a conversation with my husband while one of us is in the kitchen and the other is on the couch.” Working with her Sweeten general contractor was one of the highlights of the project. “He was wonderful about checking in with me. His communication skills were top notch. I cannot stress enough how pleased I am with his finished work. He wanted things done the right way and not just the easiest way.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Marissa knew she needed an eye-catching piece for the wall above the peninsula. “It’s the first thing you will see, walking into the apartment,” she said. “I found a knife rack made out of dark walnut wood fairly easily (Amazon for the win!), but for the life of me, I couldn’t find a small interesting shelf.” She ended up coming across an octagonal shelf on Wayfair that “charmed” her with its shape but was the wrong color so she painted the black metal gold and stained the wood with a darker shade before assembling it.</p>

<p>(Above) <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan and Mike&#8217;s industrial-influenced kitchen</a> with peninsula</p>
<p>If you live in a studio or a small apartment, there’s a good chance that your kitchen is tiny. When planning the floorplan of a smaller space, much of the square footage goes to the main living area, perhaps a living room in a one-bedroom apartment or a bedroom in a studio. And if there’s not a wall between your kitchen and the rest of your space, you likely have a dead-end; an empty gap, the end of a row of cabinets, or the fridge. Instead of leaving the unfinished end open, make the most of it by adding a small peninsula to extend prep space, boost storage, and gain a dining area. Below are five examples from Sweeten renovations<span>—</span>small kitchens with peninsulas<span>—</span>that added a &#8220;table for two&#8221; to extend their space.</p>
<h3>A small kitchen peninsula with seating replaces a formal dining room</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27612 size-chrono" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frans and Dalal&#8217;s kitchen</a> in Gramercy</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With their kitchen squeezed into a small nook in the center of their Gramercy studio, Frans and Dalal had no room for a proper dining table. A small peninsula at the edge of the space allowed them to get creative, adding a dining spot that’s just the right size for the two of them. The peninsula also houses their microwave behind a &#8220;secret&#8221; cabinet door, increasing the available surface space of their countertops.</p>
<h3>Adding a small kitchen peninsula doubles countertop space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23889 size-chrono" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kellys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-sweeten-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kellys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-sweeten-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kelly&#8217;s kitchen</a> in Brooklyn Heights</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kelly’s small studio kitchen had a tiny square of counter space that was barely bigger than a postage stamp and a narrow ledge that served as a bar counter. In order to create more comfortable cooking and dining experience, Kelly moved the fridge outside of her kitchen’s tiny footprint, which allowed her to increase the counter space. She also swapped the bar for a slim peninsula topped with butcher block and added storage on one side with pull-out drawers.</p>
<h3>A party-ready setup, thanks to a well-placed peninsula</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28089 size-chrono" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brooklyn-interior-design-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brooklyn-interior-design-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Donna&#8217;s kitchen</a> in South Slope</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna’s kitchen was contained in a small, box-shaped room off of the main living area. The couple chose to extend the kitchen beyond the limits of its walls by incorporating a peninsula that connected to the wall that concealed the fridge. With its proximity to the kitchen and the main living area, the peninsula is now the perfect spot to lay out appetizers for a party.</p>
<h3>Knocking down a wall allows for peninsula seating space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_HeatherUWSKitchen-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28091 size-chrono" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_HeatherUWSKitchen-14-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/heathers-sweetened-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heather&#8217;s kitchen</a> on the Upper West Side</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The light from the window in Heather’s kitchen never reached the rest of her living space because of a wall. Taking down that wall was the first step in opening up her apartment and allowing the light to flow through. It also gave her the opportunity to build a peninsula for dining and entertaining that made better use of the small front room next to her kitchen.</p>
<h3>Expand small kitchen layouts with a peninsula ideal for eating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Giovanni_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22643 size-chrono" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Giovanni_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Giovanni_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Giovanni_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Giovanni_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Giovanni_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Giovanni_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/tired-kitchen-gets-jumpstart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giovanni&#8217;s kitchen</a> in Cobble Hill</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen in Giovanni’s apartment was not a room per se, but rather a collection of cabinets and appliances lined up along the back wall of his studio. To create some separation between the kitchen and main living area, Giovanni built a peninsula to both define the space and add a prep area. He also tucked his washer-dryer unit beneath it and extended the countertop. The result: a perfect ledge for dining.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Optimize the workflow of a kitchen in Queens</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Lisa and Chris (with their four-year-old daughter Mackenzie and a dog called Porkchop) bought their prewar co-op apartment in Kew Gardens knowing it would need some work. After a year of living in the 1,100-square-foot space, they pulled the trigger on a kitchen renovation. It had very little working counter space and the layout was a little on the silly side. “The old refrigerator, when opened, blocked the door to the living room,” said Lisa, making for a clumsy dance when someone needed to get by. If Chris was using the stove and she needed the microwave that meant another awkward shuffle to accommodate. “It was a nice kitchen, but it just didn&#8217;t work for us,” they concluded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Lisa and Chris <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/17475" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> on <span class="s1">Sweeten, a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors, and were</span> matched with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a> who had experience reworking kitchens in co-op buildings.<span class="s1"> </span>To open up the kitchen, the couple had part of a wall torn down where the fridge once was. That allowed them to extend the counter space and paved the way for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peninsula</a> with storage below and seating for guests to gather while the hosts cooked.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I think knocking the wall down and adding the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countertop</a> was what we were most excited about,” said Lisa. It also made the space feel larger. “It opened up the natural lighting between the living room and kitchen because of where the windows were situated,” said Chris. The swinging doors on the bottom cabinets were replaced with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sliding drawers</a>, so the couple no longer needed to “squat down and peer into dark shelves.” The daily progress updates from their contractor were appreciated as the family lived in the apartment <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during the renovation</a>. Porkchop also had a deep fear of the plastic sheeting in the renovation area. To calm the pup, their contractor minimized the footprint of their workspace at the end of each day and kept the plastic as contained as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: They added strip lights under the cabinets for some <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambient lighting</a>. It became a perfect midway between no illumination and the aggressive glare from the overhead fixture. “It turned out to be a really nice touch during those sleepy, overcast mornings,&#8221; they agreed.</p>

</ul>
<p><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowners Cat and Jordan</i></p>
<h3>Making the space modern</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cat and Jordan closed on their 1,000-square-foot, co-op apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. They loved the prewar apartment&#8217;s location and proximity to the park. But, they were put off by the interior’s worn and outdated appearance. The color scheme—yellowy-beige walls against the bright red brick of a non-functioning fireplace and tired cherry cabinets—was not to their taste.</p>

<p>The walls had been repainted too many times to count. As a result, it had a “thick, uneven, mushroom-colored appearance.” The wiring, which lined around the baseboards, was nonfunctional. Layers of shiny yellow varnish obscured the parquet wood floors (which Cat was partial to, having grown up in a home with it).</p>
<p>The couple wanted to brighten up the space by stripping the walls and floors. Bookcases around the fireplace would add interest to the long span of wall. A new dark gray kitchen ticked the box of the “warm modern home with spare decorations&#8221; they wanted.</p>
<h3>Finding the right renovation team</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main goal was to make their apartment “look as big, bright, and clean as possible.” They were uncertain about how to turn their vision into reality. They weren&#8217;t &#8220;design people,&#8221; Cat admitted, and “needed a lot of guidance.” Posting their project on Sweeten, they found a contractor to provide the direction they needed. The couple described the process: “The contractor genuinely loves working with clients, explaining choices and limitations. He knew when to give us the ultimate stylistic decision and when to push back with his expert opinion.”</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26874 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="custom cabinets" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26869 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-03-723x482.jpg" alt="custom cabinets" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<h3>Installing dark gray kitchen cabinetry</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, they would create an elegant and functional design. Since the kitchen opens into the living room, it was important for the materials in both rooms to echo each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dark gray kitchen cabinetry contrasted with white quartz countertops and a stainless steel backsplash. Instead of handles, drawers had carved-out pull tabs for a streamlined look. The utensil drawers were made of natural walnut. Cat said, “I never thought that the inside of a drawer could, or even should, be beautiful, but I appreciate seeing the woodwork every time I reach for a utensil.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-06-08.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26871 mb-0 size-chrono" title="custom drawer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-06-08.gif" alt="custom drawer" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<h3>Adding a kitchen peninsula</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were some minor changes made as the demolition got underway. Originally, an island was planned for additional prep and storage space, but the demo revealed that the dividing wall couldn&#8217;t be knocked down. They scaled the island back to a <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen peninsula</a> with a smaller footprint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In the end,&#8221; they said, &#8220;the peninsula was perfect and very functional.” On the kitchen side, the peninsula held the kitchenware and cookware, along with a trash and recycling bin. On the dining room side, napkins, placemats, and cookbooks filled the cabinet space.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26870 size-chrono" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="custom cabinets" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26872 mb-0 size-chrono" title="custom cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="custom cabinets" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Prepare yourself for the possibility that something unexpected can happen during a renovation, especially in an old building.”
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Changing up format and flooring</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their Sweeten contractor suggested the modern and very useful reverse L-shaped bar top. It provided a “comfortable and practical surface for resting a coffee mug or working on a laptop.” The open design between the bar and peninsula created a seamless transition to the living space. The bar top was a natural spot for appetizers when entertaining, and “people seem to naturally congregate around it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cat and Jordan were most excited about the kitchen floor tiles. Cat wanted an abstract, black-and-white pattern. With their contractor&#8217;s help, they decided on a medley of Moroccan cement tiles in black, white, and gray hues. As Jordan explained, “The more traditional patterns reflected the age of the apartment and the black casement windows, while the mix of different patterns added an informal feel.&#8221; The same tile configuration sits in front of the fireplace tying the two rooms together.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26882 size-chrono" title="custom bookcases" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="custom bookcases" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<h3>The value of skim coating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the living room, their contractor designed a new fireplace mantel to complement the new built-in bookshelves. The clean lines provided a focal point. The walls were also skim coated and repainted. Initially, Jordan did not see the value in spending the time and money on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skim coating</a> (a texturing technique to hide construction tape and other imperfections to give walls a smooth and plaster-like appearance). However, they were so glad they did it. “I can’t believe what a difference it made—the whole place looks lighter, brighter, and fresher.” The parquet floors were stripped and refinished in a matte coating, preserving their original wood tones.</p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26867 mb-0 size-chrono" title="custom bookcases" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="custom bookcases" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<h3>Living at home during a renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cat and Jordan&#8217;s biggest challenge was <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living through the construction</a>. It took longer than expected due to hold-ups with the cabinetry. They had to wash dishes in the bathroom and eat a lot of takeout. Wicket, their Norfolk Terrier, was curious about all the construction, so a baby gate was set up to keep her safe. “Wicket was pretty suspicious of the floor-sanding equipment, wood-cutting tools, and other supplies,&#8221; said Jordan. &#8220;Luckily, our contractors did a fantastic job consolidating the equipment in the construction zone and cleaning up at the end of each day, so we only had a few barking flip-outs.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26883 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-13-723x482.jpg" alt="custom bookcases" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, the couple has a bit of advice for future renovators. They say watch some home renovation shows to get design ideas. However, &#8220;prepare yourself for the possibility that something unexpected can happen during a renovation, especially in an old building.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While no budget-blowing issues came up, they did learn to take construction surprises in stride. “Having watched so many renovation TV shows, we felt relieved that nothing major popped up and were less disturbed by minor changes in the plans.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b></b>From homework HQ to a prep and serving station at your next get-together, the kitchen peninsula proves its versatility</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike a kitchen <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island</a>, which has clearance on all sides, a peninsula is joined to the rest of the kitchen, often meeting with a nearby counter or wall to transform an L-shape layout into a much more functional U-shape. It&#8217;s a popular choice among homeowners who don’t have enough space for an island—three feet all around is normally required for comfortable clearance—or prefer to have a more cohesive kitchen layout. It’s also a great way to create visual separation between two spaces in an open plan apartment. You can take the delineation one step further by defining different functions for each side of the peninsula—<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> and prep space on one side and seating on the other. Below, a look at five homeowners, each with a one-of-a-kind kitchen peninsula.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22215 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua’s kitchen</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Removing the wall between the kitchen and dining room in Erica and Joshua’s apartment greatly improved the usability of the space. In order to find a compromise between Joshua’s preference for an open plan layout and Erica’s desire to maintain some visual privacy between rooms, a peninsula was built in the kitchen to divide it from the dining area. It was designed with generous storage on both sides in the form of drawers and a cabinet on one end. With bar seating for three, and a gooseneck sconce illuminating one end, the peninsula is the perfect spot to dine or sit down with a laptop. It’s also a good size with plenty of surface space, allowing the couple to use it at the same time—cooking and working face-to-face.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23623 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-renovation-sets-space-straight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meredith and Jason’s kitchen</a> in Chelsea, Manhattan<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23630 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>The view from the other side of Meredith and Jason&#8217;s peninsula.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to swap out the awkwardly placed island in their small kitchen, Meredith and Jason’s Sweeten general contractor suggested that they go with a wide peninsula. “As soon as I saw the drawing, I was on board with it,” said Meredith. The new kitchen peninsula doubles counter space while providing a spot for the microwave—<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tucking it out of sight</a>—and plenty of deep drawers for storage. Plus, bar seating on the side facing the dining room allows Meredith to do some work and keep Jason company while he cooks. The white waterfall counter makes it an attractive statement piece as you walk in the front door.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23095 mt-24 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/apartment-party-four-five/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam and Sean’s kitchen</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sam and Sean wanted to make their kitchen feel as large as possible, so a big island was out of the question. Instead, a small peninsula was installed to provide additional prep space and storage while adding some separation between the kitchen and main living area. The custom area was topped with butcher block to create contrast with the white Caesarstone counters used in the rest of the kitchen. Designed with three sides and three distinct purposes in mind, the kitchen peninsula is well-equipped with drawers on one side, bar seating for two on the other, and shelving for storing books on the end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24134 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="3744" height="5616" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg 3744w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3744px) 100vw, 3744px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-remodel-breaks-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emily and Trey’s kitchen</a> in downtown Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening up Emily and Trey’s cramped kitchen by taking down walls and removing the loft storage above it gave the couple plenty of room to work with. To make the most of the newly opened space, a wide L-shaped peninsula with a Carrara marble countertop was installed with bar seating along one side—quickly becoming a popular spot for Emily’s two kids to hang out while she cooks. Placing the kitchen sink in the peninsula was an ideal location since it faced the windows with lots of natural light and allowed ease of conversation with the family in the living area. The white column holding the intercom could not be moved, so the Sweeten contractor integrated it into the structure, transforming it into a cool architectural element.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-14_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25062 mt-24 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="681" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000-300x204.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000-600x409.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-henrys-east-village-condo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henry’s kitchen</a> in the West Village, Manhattan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Henry saw the potential to connect his kitchen and living room and took advantage of it, taking down a wall between the rooms and replacing it with a peninsula. Adding this structure extended his kitchen’s L-shape into a more functional and versatile U-shape. Beyond expanding storage and prep space, the main attraction is the range, placed in the center, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hood</a> overhead, making it a more sociable spot from which to cook. As a bonus, Henry tucked a front-loading <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">washer and dryer</a> underneath the peninsula, making them both easily accessible from the living room. That&#8217;s one hard-working peninsula!</p>
