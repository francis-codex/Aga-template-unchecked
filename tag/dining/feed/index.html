										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Dining in style, from kitchen tables to islands with seating</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the eat-in kitchen, the “eat-in” part is usually the last piece of the puzzle. Kitchen design typically revolves around cooking while the notion of dining in the space is often an afterthought. However, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a renovation platform connecting homeowners to a vetted general contractor, has seen a growing trend in considering both activities during the design stage. While small spaces demand multiple functionality in the kitchen, a more thoughtfully layout combines seating, a more organic flow, and space planning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Explore the possibilities that these Sweeten homeowners undertook with their eat-in kitchens, from dining tables to counter seating. All will invite family and friends to &#8220;break bread&#8221; with you at home!</p>
<h3>A kitchen banquette beckons for company</h3>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43214" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg" alt="kitchen banquette" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With only one window in the kitchen to let in light, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/duplex-remodel-first-time-renovators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenn and Jon</a> took steps to create a brighter atmosphere for their family of four. A partial wall that sectioned off an eat-in area from the kitchen came down effectively joining the two spaces and letting the sunshine stream in. Cooking and eating together were top priorities and a U-shaped banquette lent a cozy gathering spot around the square-shaped dining table. Wallpaper and paneling give it separation and personality.</p>
<h3>A peninsula bar multitasks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41636" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="dining nook" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-riverdale-bronx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth and Martin</a>’s 124-square-foot galley kitchen, tackling the space planning and bringing a sense of openness was done with the help of their Sweeten design-build team. The couple&#8217;s comfort level for all of the renovation changes was put at ease with “sketches from every angle.” Pulling down two partial walls was step one in bringing in more light. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new peninsula bar seats four to five stools reminiscent of a cute bistro—and holds storage. Form and function increase with more prep space, glass-front cabinets, and a mix of finishes. Clutter minimizes with the microwave tucked behind a cabinet and the paper towel holder rolls out from under the countertop.</span></p>
<h3>More function for a larger kitchen</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42916" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1.jpg" alt="Townhouse renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/apartment-vs-house-a-brooklyn-family-decides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jill and Cy</a> created an open concept on the first floor of their single-family townhouse. The kitchen was expanded for the family of four by turning a full bath into a powder room giving more exposure to the black-trimmed doors leading to the backyard. With ample room, a dining table and chairs fit easily in the cook space for meals and entertaining. The flat-panel walnut cabinetry, ceiling light fixture, and furniture displayed the mid-century modern aesthetic. A cut-out window seat that doubles as storage was a bonus feature.</span></p>
<h3>Centerstage for an island</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40332 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="s1">A salvaged slab of walnut picked up at a reclaimed wood supplier took centerstage in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara and Brian</a>’s kitchen. “I remember when I was a kid, the kitchen island was the center of existence,” she said. Aiming for the rustic look, two sides were live edge while the wood’s cherry red tone was lacquered. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The refrigerator was relocated within a row of existing closets off the kitchen proper creating a unified flow for the rest of the apartment. A disguised pantry covered in subway tile is a fun “Where’s Waldo?” moment. And that walnut slab? There was enough left over to fashion open shelving for the kitchen, home office, and the bathroom.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42357" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg" alt="studio loft kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A kitchenette found new life in its studio loft with new <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/midtown-remodel-industrial-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowners Serge and Uldis</a> who worked to make full use of all of the space available. Situated underneath the loft, a small dining table and chairs enhance the cozy grotto feel. Opting for an L-shaped layout, appliances moved along the back wall giving room to install plenty of countertop surface. A mix of stainless steel and white cabinets are backdrops to a glossy black tempered glass backsplash. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Thanks to kitchen banquette seating, casual dinners just got cozier</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mealtime is about more than just eating a meal: it’s about sharing one. How to fit all of your loved ones around the table to break bread? Look no further than banquette seating. These cozy benches are ideal for promoting intimacy and maximizing floor space. See how these homeowners worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, to bring kitchen banquette seating to their homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29713 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01.jpg" alt="The addition of banquette seating gave this family new, flexible eating options" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">1. Additional Dining Options</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/1920s-westchester-home-gets-a-modern-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooke and Paul’s</a> kitchen didn’t fit the family of five’s active lifestyle. They needed a more functional space for their three kids. That&#8217;s why they created multiple kitchen dining areas. From an eat-in island to a kitchen banquette, the new additions gave the family more flexible seating options. The custom L-shaped bench provides a casual, comfortable family dining space.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" title="gray-patterned-walls-large-dining-tables"  class="alignnone wp-image-44345 mb-48 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-22.jpg" alt="gray patterned walls for large dining tables and chairs with orange benches after renovation" width="1000" height="692" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-22-600x415.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-22-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />2. Flexible Family Time</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/duplex-remodel-first-time-renovators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenn and Jon’s</a> top priority was transforming their galley kitchen into “…a well-laid-out space where we can cook and eat together as a family.&#8221; To start, they knocked down dividing walls and a small pocket door. Next, they installed U-shaped eat-in kitchen banquette seating. Finally, this family had a space where they could gather for both meals and quality time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-25.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34493 size-full" title="banquette" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-25.jpg" alt="This banquette seating gives homeowners more seating and additional storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-25.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-25-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-25-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-25-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3. Room to Entertain</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prewar details gave <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Walter’s </a>home lots of charm. However, the original kitchen layout was a challenge. With their Sweeten contractor, the couple completely reimagined the space. Together, they created a kitchen with room to cook and entertain. The dining nook now provides additional seating and plenty of storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25551 size-full" title="dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-03.jpg" alt="This under-window banquette seating gives the space more seating and storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-03-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">4. Seating and Storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nazli and Larry’s</a> townhouse renovation was a big undertaking. They decided to turn the parlor into a dining room and bar area. They also added a long, built-in bench beneath the large Tiffany window. This new addition supplies plenty of seating and offers hidden storage. Most importantly, it&#8217;s where the couple currently houses their son’s drawing supplies.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to eat out more often, but hate spending a fortune on restaurants, you should consider an outdoor kitchen. While you can spend almost as much on an <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/outdoor-kitchen-patio-ideas/">outdoor kitchen</a> as your indoor one, it’ll ultimately add resale value to your home. In a recent study, the National Association of Home Builders reported that outdoor kitchens add at least 100 percent of their value to a home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make the most of your outdoor kitchen, consider carefully these points:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Enhance your outdoor kitchen space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work with your contractor on finding the ideal location to build out your kitchen. Classic materials like brick, stone, or stucco can work nicely with many architectural styles of a home. These materials work especially well with older homes—and appear integrated.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Make your outdoor kitchen comfortable</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Allow room for dining and lounging both before and after the meal. You&#8217;ll need a shady or covered area paved with stone or wood to support furniture. You also want to add lighting for the dining and seating area, plus the kitchen area. This way, you&#8217;ll enjoy the space after sundown, while having an <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/entertaining-kitchens/">open plan that keeps the cook near the guests</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Pick outdoor kitchen appliances wisely</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Buy only what you know you will really use. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/">Avoid fixtures that serve only one function, unless you will use them regularly</a>. If your family loves pizza, by all means, add the pizza oven. If you entertain frequently, you can use a warming drawer. But do you really need that smoker?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Invest in high-quality outdoor kitchen materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything that goes into your outdoor kitchen should be made to work outdoors. But, still, everything you have installed will remain outside year-round, so it needs to be able to withstand changing weather. Buy from brands with national reputations so you can get a customer service person when you need one, including on the weekend. Also, <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-ways-care-renovated-home/">check the warranties</a> to make certain the company will back up their products.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Expect the unexpected</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At some point, an appliance or pipe will have to be repaired or possibly replaced. Work with your contractor to design installation so that electrical, gas, and water can be easily reached for repair or adjustment, if needed, without breaking down any beautiful stone surround or concrete foundation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Plan the setup and location of your outdoor kitchen</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your setup can be built-in or freestanding, depending on its location in relation to the structure of your house. Freestanding is quicker to get up and running, and you can take some features (like the grill) with you, should you move. However, built-in gives a more designed look and allows for optional but important features like a sink. ”If they are relatively close together, an outdoor kitchen can utilize the indoor kitchen’s capabilities, such as prep space and storage,” says Russ Faulk, chief designer and head of product for <a href="https://kalamazoogourmet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kalamazoo Outdoor Gourmet</a>, a manufacturer of outdoor kitchen appliances. “Conversely, a fully independent outdoor kitchen with refrigeration, warming cabinets and cabinetry is more self-reliant, but will require more space and connections for gas, water, and electricity.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are also outdoor kitchen appliance “kits” from companies like EP Henry. These include everything—the grill, cabinets, countertop, even bricks for the surrounding structure, plus a sink. Only experienced DIYers should put this combo together and will need to pull all the permits for construction and utilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the location of a built-in kitchen, if you place it against an outer wall of your house, you won’t have to run water and gas lines as far as if you were to locate it some further distance within the yard. You will, however, likely need a <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/">ventilation hood to prevent cooking smells from drifting</a> into your house. Work with an experienced contractor who can help you maximize your budget by finding the best location for easy utility access. He or she will also be able to tell you if you need that vent hood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Location (and climate) will also be a factor as to whether your outdoor kitchen grill station should be sheltered or exposed. Even appliances made for outdoor use shouldn&#8217;t be exposed to driving rain or snow, or prolonged, sub-zero temperatures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Always check to see if a permit is necessary before starting your outdoor kitchen project,” advises Russ. Your contractor can handle this, as he or she should be highly knowledgeable about local codes. These codes would include easement, permeable surface requirements, water restrictions, and height restrictions. Besides getting help with all those permits, learn about the other benefits of working with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed contractor</a> on your outdoor kitchen project.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choosing the right features</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The outdoor kitchen can be as large and tricked out as your space and budget will allow, but to make it fully functional, you will need to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition/">outfit it like you do the indoor kitchen</a>, with designated areas for prep, cooking, and clean-up, as well as dining and hanging out.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: The grill</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the center of any kitchen is the stove or, in this case, an outdoor kitchen grill.  Outdoors kitchen grills can be as sophisticated as you want, with two, three, or five burners, plus an accompanying warming drawer, side burners, and pizza oven. Confirm that whatever outdoor grill you choose is from an established manufacturer that specializes in grills and offers a solid warranty.  If you’re in the market for a freestanding outdoor kitchen grill, look at companies like KitchenAid, Dacor, and Monogram. These brands are known for their indoor cooking appliances, and also offer outdoor gas-operated products. Their outdoor products have modern combos of multiple burners and side grills, which let you cook several items simultaneously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Manufacturers devoted just to grills, like Weber, also offer plenty of choice for both freestanding and built-ins. Check that the area below the grill can handle the grill&#8217;s weight, and the heat it will emit, as well as any sparks that might fly out. The counter or workspace should be adjacent to the grill and burners. Make sure you can sanitize it for food preparation. “Keep a buffer zone between hot grills, ovens or cooktops and any people,” says Russ, who recommends a minimum of 9 inches of countertop extension behind and to the sides of all hot appliances.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: A fridge or freezer</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You probably don’t need a full-size fridge outside. An under-counter version will do the trick to chill protein until cook time, while keeping drinks cold. If you have the room, you could enjoy two fridges, one for food and one for beverages. The most common width for under-counter models is 24 inches, but 21- and 18-inch versions, as well as drawers, are available from major commercial fridge makers like Summit. Expect to pay $1,000 to $2,000 (for a double-drawer version)—as much as a grill. Make sure the model you buy is UL-listed and rated food-safe for outdoor use.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: Sinks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A sink, while not mandatory, makes outdoor entertaining much easier. You&#8217;ll be able to rinse hands and wash dishes, so you don’t have to take dirty dishes back into the house, or fill up a water pitcher. You&#8217;ll just need a water line connected to your home water supply, or a hook-up through a hose if you just need cold water. You’ll want weather-resistant 16-gauge stainless-steel for the sink. Then ask yourself, single or double basin? Splurge on a bar station that includes a sink, plus condiment trays, and an insulated ice bucket from Home Depot. Or, supplement your cook station with a modular side burner and sink combo from Master Forge. Wondering about a dishwasher? Demand is low so they are hard to find. Best to rinse dishes in that sink and cart the load to the house to finish inside.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: Lighting</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For comfort and aesthetics, outdoor lighting is a no-brainer. It’s also necessary for safety. As with the indoor kitchen, you want the prep and grill areas well-lit. Dining and seating areas can get by with softer, ambient lighting, but make sure pathways are lit so no one stumbles at night. Your contractor can help you determine the appropriate outdoor options for spotlights focused on task areas, as well as pendant, post, or string lighting to illuminate the dining and lounging areas, and lantern or path lighting for groundcover. Again, you want fixtures made to be operated outdoors, but look for LED versions. This option is preferable because LEDs give off little heat, can handle temperature swings from -40F to 180F, and last up to 10 years or for 100,000 hours of continuous use. You’ll find the widest range of selection at box stores where you can see the lights illuminated to help you decide if you like the effect.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Tip: Keep convenience within reach</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since your contractor is running lines for utilities, ask them to include electrical outlets for small appliances, like a blender, portable stereo, and space heaters. Your contractor will know the correct type of outdoor outlets, which should be ground fault circuit interpreter (GFCI).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cooking on the grill is a great American pastime, whether entertaining friends or feeding your family. Maximize your enjoyment by adding some sizzle to al fresco dining with a beautiful, super-functional outdoor kitchen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b></b>From homework HQ to a prep and serving station at your next get-together, the kitchen peninsula proves its versatility</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike a kitchen <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island</a>, which has clearance on all sides, a peninsula is joined to the rest of the kitchen, often meeting with a nearby counter or wall to transform an L-shape layout into a much more functional U-shape. It&#8217;s a popular choice among homeowners who don’t have enough space for an island—three feet all around is normally required for comfortable clearance—or prefer to have a more cohesive kitchen layout. It’s also a great way to create visual separation between two spaces in an open plan apartment. You can take the delineation one step further by defining different functions for each side of the peninsula—<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> and prep space on one side and seating on the other. Below, a look at five homeowners, each with a one-of-a-kind kitchen peninsula.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22215 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua’s kitchen</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Removing the wall between the kitchen and dining room in Erica and Joshua’s apartment greatly improved the usability of the space. In order to find a compromise between Joshua’s preference for an open plan layout and Erica’s desire to maintain some visual privacy between rooms, a peninsula was built in the kitchen to divide it from the dining area. It was designed with generous storage on both sides in the form of drawers and a cabinet on one end. With bar seating for three, and a gooseneck sconce illuminating one end, the peninsula is the perfect spot to dine or sit down with a laptop. It’s also a good size with plenty of surface space, allowing the couple to use it at the same time—cooking and working face-to-face.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23623 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-renovation-sets-space-straight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meredith and Jason’s kitchen</a> in Chelsea, Manhattan<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23630 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>The view from the other side of Meredith and Jason&#8217;s peninsula.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to swap out the awkwardly placed island in their small kitchen, Meredith and Jason’s Sweeten general contractor suggested that they go with a wide peninsula. “As soon as I saw the drawing, I was on board with it,” said Meredith. The new kitchen peninsula doubles counter space while providing a spot for the microwave—<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tucking it out of sight</a>—and plenty of deep drawers for storage. Plus, bar seating on the side facing the dining room allows Meredith to do some work and keep Jason company while he cooks. The white waterfall counter makes it an attractive statement piece as you walk in the front door.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23095 mt-24 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/apartment-party-four-five/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam and Sean’s kitchen</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sam and Sean wanted to make their kitchen feel as large as possible, so a big island was out of the question. Instead, a small peninsula was installed to provide additional prep space and storage while adding some separation between the kitchen and main living area. The custom area was topped with butcher block to create contrast with the white Caesarstone counters used in the rest of the kitchen. Designed with three sides and three distinct purposes in mind, the kitchen peninsula is well-equipped with drawers on one side, bar seating for two on the other, and shelving for storing books on the end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24134 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="3744" height="5616" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg 3744w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3744px) 100vw, 3744px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-remodel-breaks-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emily and Trey’s kitchen</a> in downtown Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening up Emily and Trey’s cramped kitchen by taking down walls and removing the loft storage above it gave the couple plenty of room to work with. To make the most of the newly opened space, a wide L-shaped peninsula with a Carrara marble countertop was installed with bar seating along one side—quickly becoming a popular spot for Emily’s two kids to hang out while she cooks. Placing the kitchen sink in the peninsula was an ideal location since it faced the windows with lots of natural light and allowed ease of conversation with the family in the living area. The white column holding the intercom could not be moved, so the Sweeten contractor integrated it into the structure, transforming it into a cool architectural element.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-14_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25062 mt-24 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="681" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000-300x204.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000-600x409.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-henrys-east-village-condo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henry’s kitchen</a> in the West Village, Manhattan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Henry saw the potential to connect his kitchen and living room and took advantage of it, taking down a wall between the rooms and replacing it with a peninsula. Adding this structure extended his kitchen’s L-shape into a more functional and versatile U-shape. Beyond expanding storage and prep space, the main attraction is the range, placed in the center, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hood</a> overhead, making it a more sociable spot from which to cook. As a bonus, Henry tucked a front-loading <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">washer and dryer</a> underneath the peninsula, making them both easily accessible from the living room. That&#8217;s one hard-working peninsula!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">A developer&#8217;s dark style is transformed by its new owner with high-gloss cabinets, drawers turned sideways, and a comfy window seat</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24340 mb-0 size-chrono" title="window seat" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-Portrait-723x1085.jpg" alt="window seat" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</b></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redesign a kitchen</a> with a bright sheen in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: There was much to love about the two-bedroom condo in Bed-Stuy that Ursula, a math teacher, recently purchased. The developer, who had just converted a brownstone into four apartments, did a good job. However, the brand new kitchen just wasn’t her style. The dark mahogany cabinets and kitchen island weighed it down as did the floorboards of a similar color. The cabinets above the range also gave the space a claustrophobic feel. “The developer seemed to have an imagination when it came to painting. The walls were blue and yellow and very specific to his taste,” said Ursula.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>After</b></span>: Since her new apartment only has windows on the front and back, Ursula used <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, <span class="s1">a free service matching homeowners with general contractors to </span>tap her Sweeten contractor and harness that light. So out went the dark cabinets. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wood floors</a> were stripped and restained. To open up the kitchen, the cabinets and microwave above the range were out, too (“it just isn’t a pretty appliance,” said Ursula, speaking of microwaves). In their place is now a sleek <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hood</a>. With the space more open, the hexagonal tiles chosen for the backsplash became a focal point. “I think it must be the math teacher in me, but there is just something about them that I love,” she said. A &#8220;dresser&#8221;-style <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island</a> features three drawers for silverware, cutlery, dishes, and some pots and pans. &#8220;My beech cutting board is always on top of the kitchen island for food prep,&#8221; says Ursula. &#8220;It is conveniently in front of the oven, so I just have to turn around to cook.&#8221; The storage unit&#8217;s glossy gray tone offers contrast to the mostly white space. Her Sweeten contractor also utilized every inch of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinet space</a> including a stubborn area next to the oven. There, a drawer installed on its side—a cabinet wouldn&#8217;t fit—became a convenient <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pull-out spice rack</a>. As for the microwave, a much smaller one is hidden in the upper cabinets.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: Ursula&#8217;s Sweeten contractor used the same kitchen cabinet system from Ikea to create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bench seat</a> near the window. Now, there’s more storage space and extra seating for when guests come over. “That&#8217;s one of my favorite areas in the apartment because it is a little unexpected,” she says. </span></p>
