<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting started on commercial renovations can be both an exciting and overwhelming time. Perhaps you’re launching a business you’ve been dreaming about for a long time, or, if that dream has already proven successful, you’re expanding (congratulations!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches business owners to the best general contractors and helps the renovation stay on track, offers these guidelines for taking on commercial renovations, whether you are gearing up for an office build-out, a restaurant, retail space or some other venture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We based this article on New York City, but it has relevance to wherever you are in the country. The majority of US states base their codes on guidelines from the International Code Council. Cities and towns also have similar procedures when it comes to requirements such as building permits and Certificate of Occupancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few ways to get a head start with your own research. For example, taking a look at your potential building&#8217;s Certificate of Occupancy (CO) or browsing through online building records to get an idea of existing violations. Once you are seriously considering either buying or leasing a property or renovating what you have, that’s the right time to bring in a pro—an engineer, an architect, or a good or knowledgeable general contractor—so there are no surprises down the road.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few things to consider before unleashing the sledgehammer, and in some cases, signing a lease.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40003 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/HowSweetenWorks.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="50" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review the certificate of occupancy</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Number one, two, and three on your checklist before even committing to a lease should be: check the CO, check the CO, and check the CO. The document shows what you can legally use a property for—an office, a private residence, a restaurant, etc. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Here’s a <a href="https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/bsqpm01.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> to search in New York City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changing a CO is a costly process and, in some cases, it’s impossible to shift it to another use, according to Mercedes Hernandez from S&amp;M Expediting. Expediters are an optional addition to your building team to speed up the slow grind of permits, especially for commercial renovations in bureaucratic cities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We get a lot of calls after the fact when they start the process of getting necessary licenses. That’s when they realize they have a problem,” she said. One client signed a lease with the intention of turning a space into a gym. However, the certificate did not allow for a health club in the premises. That client is still trying to change it and it has already been 12 months. The easiest route is to lease or buy a space where the CO fits your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COs can also dictate smaller issues. For example, if you want to use the property’s backyard for additional restaurant seating, the certificate needs to specify that this is allowable. Otherwise, the CO will need <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/cofo_guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updating</a>. Smaller additions such as this are a much easier fix than a change in the legal use of a property, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><br />Understand existing violations on your property</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Especially if the property you’re eyeing hasn’t changed hands or had a new tenant for some time, it’s possible it already has building violations. It could be that someone did work without a permit, installed a rooftop AC unit incorrectly, or the fire sprinkler system isn’t functioning. “When you go to get a permit, these things are scrutinized and discovered,” explained <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. If the violations aren’t corrected, that could mean a costly stop-work order on your construction project later on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To kickstart this process, like COs, city councils often keep online databases where you can search open violations, when a permitted job was last completed on a building, and what that job was. Complaints about the building—such as work without a permit or a business operating without the correct CO—might also give you a hint at what violations you could encounter. The good news is with a commercial lease it is common to get these violations taken care of by the landlord, but the lease needs to specify this, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While you might get a sense of a building’s open violations from your own research, it’s unlikely you will spot every one of them on your own. The best plan is to walk through a potential location for your business with an architect, engineer or a GC, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Mark</a>, another Sweeten general contractor. That pro will help you decide if a property is a workable fit for your vision, he said. It’s also something that pros often do as a complimentary service to potential clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you need to determine if your property can handle the weight of your business. And in some cases, we mean that quite literally. Hernandez’s example illustrates the point: if you want to flip a clothing retail space into a car showroom, it’s a wise idea to make sure the floor can support the added weight. Or how about creating an open-plan office that’s perfect for teamwork? Before drawing up those plans, you need to know what walls are load-bearing and if they can be moved. If moving that wall (or not) is a deal breaker, it’s best to know the capabilities of a space before signing on the dotted line. “You need to ask what are the limits of design,” said Sweeten contractor Colin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessing the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEPs) situation is crucial especially if you’re turning a space into a food establishment with a kitchen. Gas, plumbing and electrical will be under more pressure, so can the property’s existing infrastructure handle it, or is an extensive overhaul required? If it is, prepare your budget and timeline realistically. That’s <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/nycbe/downloads/pdf/nycstarter_guide_restaurant.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another reason</a> besides the existing CO that some business owners take the express route of leasing a property that was previously a restaurant. While it&#8217;s not a given everything will be up to code (don’t forget those existing violations), it is easier and cheaper than starting from scratch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39363" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01.jpg" alt="Babeland storefront" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/babeland-retail-commercial-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A retail renovation</a> in Downtown New York by Sweeten contractor <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Checking on a building&#8217;s envelope</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An envelope is building speak for whatever separates the outside from the inside—windows, doors, roof, etc. It’s another area worth looking into before starting your project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessibility for the disabled is often overlooked. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair. While many older buildings may have had their compliance grandfathered in, major commercial renovations could <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2006/rpt/2006-R-0335.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trigger</a> the need for properties to line up with the ADA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other areas that could change the scope of your project include asbestos in window glazing, which would need to be replaced. A property that is a landmark or in a historic district could also <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/lpc/index.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impact</a> if and how you can alter your building’s facade, including doors and windows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What are your facility requirements?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most health codes will require an employer to provide access to toilet facilities. For offices, this could mean a shared bathroom on a floor, according to Hernandez, the expediter. “They have to make sure employees have access to a bathroom from within the building,” she said. One client suggested sending employees to another building, but this was not permitted under the health code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The size of a food establishment will likely determine how many bathrooms are required for patrons (some sort of bathroom access is always required for employees). In 2012, New York City actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/nyregion/rule-shift-cuts-restroom-requirements-at-new-york-restaurants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowered</a> the required bathrooms, permitting small cafes, restaurants, and bars with fewer than 31 seats to have one bathroom, not two. Those with fewer than 20 seats are <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not</a> required to provide a bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like any project, commercial renovations that are well planned and equipped with the right team of people can be exciting. Just be sure to consider these five areas early to keep your renovation on the straight and narrow.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064728861"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>What is a certificate of occupancy?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A certificate of occupancy (CO) is a document that details what someone can legally use a property for, and the limits to which the property can be changed for that use. For example, a CO could state that a property can be used as an office, a private residence, or a restaurant. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Sometimes, it is possible to change a CO to cover a different use, but this can be costly and time-consuming.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064746876"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to renovate a commercial building</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">First, review the certificate of occupancy. This will tell you what you are legally allowed to use the building for (an office space, a residence, a gym, etc.) Then, research whether there are any existing violations on the property. Review the space with an architect or contractor, and check for unpermitted work. Also review the structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work. Will you be able to move walls? Can the current flooring support your business use? Make sure the building’s envelope–the windows, doors, and roof–are in good working condition. Consider people with disabilities. Is there a way for wheelchair users to enter the building? Lastly, understand your facility requirements, like mandatory bathrooms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Updating a new or existing business location? Retail renovation costs can stay budget-friendly, or go luxe</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27189 size-chrono" title="retail store" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-723x482.jpg" alt="retail renovation cost" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14.jpg 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Designer Rebecca Taylor store&nbsp;project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor David</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening a physical brick-and-mortar store is a bold and energizing step. It’s a chance to create a walk-in version of&nbsp;a business you’ve been&nbsp;growing, or&nbsp;a tangible&nbsp;realization of a long-awaited vision to be your own boss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail renovation costs<span>—</span>for, say, a clothing or beauty boutique, yoga studio or art gallery can slide from pricey to economical&#8230;depending on what you want. Chain Store Age’s annual survey of retail build-outs put the average cost at $56.53 per square foot. If you use that formula, then it will cost $280,000 for a 5,000-square-foot store build-out. In another example, an entrepreneur in Austin, Texas, only spent $7,650 on a build-out for Little Green Beans, a children’s consignment store for clothing and toys, according to <a href="https://www.inc.com/articles/201108/business-start-up-costs-retail-store.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inc.</a>&nbsp;(The business owner&#8217;s breakdown of costs were: $4,000 construction to customize the space, $3,500 for shelves, racks, etc., and a mere $150 for a handyman).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t be too overwhelmed by this figure. As the name suggests, the&nbsp;above survey takes into account bigger stores that are more commonly found in malls than a Main Street space in an older building. A simple build-out for a smaller store<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>minor construction, a coat of paint, shelves, and racks<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>can cost under $10,000. It all depends on the scope of work and what finishes you want.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To figure out this wide world of retail build-out budgets for your project, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractors, offers a few areas to consider.<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<h3><strong>Design for a commercial storefront space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you choose to hire a designer or architect (not everyone does), expect that to take 20 percent of your renovation budget, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Carla</a>. That could mean $40,000 in a $200,000 budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail projects can be as small as custom shelving for storing product, using existing electrical wiring, and&nbsp;applying&nbsp;a fresh coat of paint. With a build-out that basic, you might avoid the need for permits, thus eliminating the need for blueprints to be approved by an architect. However, if you’re serious about optimizing the size of your space and carefully planning the customer experience, then it&#8217;s best to bring in the big guns. “What do you want the customers to experience? What do you want them to see when they first walk in?” said Carla. Then there are the more technical design elements like handicap accessibility and whether or not you need a bathroom. These are best handled by an architect.</p>
<h3><strong>Electrical costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Chain Store Age survey put the cost of interior lighting at $3.30 a square foot. As mentioned above, electrical can be kept simple by using existing wiring and even fixtures to keep these costs down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott, another Sweeten contractor</a>, has worked on retail build-outs where electrical has been as low as $10,000 or as high as $100,000. Splurges in lighting often come from a client wanting specific light fixtures that are in line with their brand. Altering the position of each light to highlight store product or fixing up existing, decrepit wiring could increase your budget for electrical. Once you get into more serious work, your project might also require the additional cost of applying for permits that could also delay your timeline, Scott said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And it isn’t just lighting that needs to be considered. If your business has additional power needs, such as a salon or a dog groomer with equipment like hair dryers, it is best to assess what power burden your ideal store location can handle before signing a lease. That way, you can either find another location or factor in an electrical upgrade into your budget if necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cjJnJjIEXOM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40884 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Plumbing costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p>This area of the budget will largely depend on:</p>
<p>A. Is there is a bathroom?</p>
<p>B. If no, then would you like a bathroom?</p>
<p>C. If you have one, will it stay in the same place?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a bathroom, then it is possible to freshen it up with a coat of paint. If there is no bathroom, you should consider if it will help your business and your staff (otherwise they might have to close the store whenever they need to use a restroom). “You want to keep customers in your store rather than give them a reason to leave,” said Scott, on why a bathroom might help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A very basic bathroom could set you back $3,000 to $6,000, according to <a href="https://home.costhelper.com/bathroom-addition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost Helper</a>. It could attract additional costs if the location is far from water and sewage lines and if you need the help from a structural engineer. A plumbing permit will also be needed. Moving a bathroom will gather similar costs with the added line item of demolition. If your business has unique needs like a washing station for a hair salon, that will be another cost to factor in.</p>
<h3><strong>Flooring and ceiling costs&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a retail build-out, flooring on average takes up $2.76 per square foot in a budget and ceilings take $1.81, according to Chain Store Age. If there are no structural issues with the flooring (again, check your lease to ensure the landlord is responsible for these costs), then what you do to the floors will likely just be cosmetic. If that is the case—you&#8217;re re-varnishing existing floors or laying some tiles—then the project likely won’t require a permit, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin,&nbsp;a Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>HVAC costs in commercial spaces</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of either fixing, replacing or installing an HVAC system costs on average about $2.61 per square foot or about $13,000 for a 5,000-square-foot space. Like everything else, this average can swing in either direction based on what you have, what you want, and what you can afford.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One way to avoid this cost entirely is to negotiate a lease that puts the responsibility of the HVAC system onto the landlord, according to Colin. As an alternative, you can volunteer to take care of the HVAC system and request that the landlord give you three months of free rent. If it is a simple step of replacing the air conditioning unit with something modern, it likely won’t require a permit, said Scott.</p>
<h3><strong>Millwork costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On average, retail build-outs spend almost $10 a square foot on display fixtures or millwork, according to the Chain Store Age survey. That’s roughly 20 percent of an average budget. But of course, it all depends on your vision for your store.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three factors that determine how expensive your displays will be are material, quantity, and what space they need to fit into, Scott said. The cost of simple wood from Home Depot will pale in comparison to teak from Brazil. Spaces, especially older ones, can also have quirks in them that need to be incorporated into the design of your shelving. “There can be a lot of bends and cuts that you have to fit the wood to,” said Scott. “That can consume a lot of time and add more to the cost.”</p>
<h3><strong>Paint costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting to the paint stage means you are close to the finish line. Your walls need to be prepared first, which might be your priciest point, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Another element that will affect your paint budget is if the color is flat, which is generally a better value than a semi-gloss. Also, the darker the color, the more coats of paint you will need, Bill said.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Real-world retail example</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To put things in perspective, here is an actual retail renovation budget for a New York beauty salon from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Paul</a>:</p>

<span class="img-label"><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-renovations-chikarashi-restaurant-nomad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chikarashi remodel</a> by this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first glance, a commercial lease may appear daunting in its length and complexity. While it’s important for tenants to engage an attorney to represent their interests in negotiating a commercial lease with a landlord, <span style="color: #000000;">it’s to the tenant&#8217;s advantage to fully understand vital lease issues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Part 2, our guide continues to outline elemental—but specific—commercial lease concepts that should be considered by prospective tenants before signing a contract. (See <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-lease-terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 1 here</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commercial leases are fairly straightforward when it comes to basic business terms, including base rent, length of <span style="color: #000000;">lease</span> term, and rent abatement (free rent). An experienced commercial real estate broker can advise on the fundamental elements while helping a tenant to negotiate the business terms of a space transaction—even before a lease is drawn or a real estate attorney is engaged.</p>
<h3>The &#8220;use clause&#8221;</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A commercial lease’s “use clause” restricts the uses permitted on the premises. Prohibitive uses usually include businesses or activities that impinge on the building’s desirability to other tenants, <span style="color: #000000;">from </span>government agencies with diplomatic immunity to specific activities like printing. A tenant will want to be sure that the uses permitted are broad enough to allow all of their probable and possible business activities. The clause also applies to any subtenant or assignee who may occupy the premises during the term of the lease (see below &#8220;On subleasing&#8221;).</p>
<h3>Plans for alterations</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After delivery conditions of the leased premises are satisfied and the space has been turned over to the tenant, any changes or alterations are subject to review and consent by the landlord before they can be performed. The review period for <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation plans</a> should be prescribed in the lease as a quick process. Cosmetic alterations, such as floor covering (generally carpet, wood, tile) and wall covering (generally paint, stain, wallpaper), should be excluded from landlord review.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having architectural plans ready at the beginning of the lease term and attached as an exhibit will save on approval time needed. It will also eat less into the free rent period given by the landlord before rent payments are scheduled to begin.</p>
<h3>Security deposit/&#8221;good guy&#8221; guarantee</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another requirement <span style="color: #000000;">(in New York and some other locations) is that a business principal, who must be a U.S. citizen or green card holder and not a temporary resident, provides </span>a “good guy” limited personal guaranty for most privately-held tenant entities—no matter how credit-worthy the tenant is. The intent is to ensure, in the event of a bankruptcy or some other situation where a tenant stops rent payments, the landlord will not have to serve an eviction to take back possession of the leased premises (in order to lease to a new tenant).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;good guy&#8221; </span>guarantor is personally liable for rent and other financial obligations for only the time the tenant actually occupies the premises. The magnitude of a security deposit usually reflects the creditworthiness of the actual entity, which is either executing the lease or providing a full corporate guaranty and is usually negotiated before a lease is prepared.</p>
<h3>On subleasing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, a tenant cannot sublet or assign the premises without the landlord’s consent. In addition, landlords want sublease rights to be defined in ways that will not diminish their ability to profitably lease other space in the building. A tenant usually cannot sublet to another tenant in the building, but this can be modified so that the tenant may sublease to an existing tenant in the building if no competitive direct space is available from the landlord. Marketing a sublet to prospective building tenants is another restriction that landlords may consider revising.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, a corporate reorganization, including acquisition, which changes the identity of the company leasing space, should not trigger the requirement that the landlord review and provide<span style="color: #000000;"> his approval, as if a whole new and related company was subleasing or being assigned the lease. </span></p>
<h3>SNDA</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SNDA stands for Subordination, Non-Disturbance, and Attornment Agreement. The critical aspect of this concept is that in the event a landlord goes bankrupt and the lender takes over the building, the lender should be required to honor the lease and not &#8220;disturb&#8221; the tenant&#8217;s occupancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a potential commercial tenant, understanding the key points in a commercial lease protects you and your investment. Doing your research and<span style="color: #000000;"> selecting the right advisors gets you one step closer to lifting your business to the</span> next level.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For a business owner, once a business plan and financing are ready, and a space for your office, <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/cost-breakdown-restaurant-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restaurant</a>, or retail space has been identified, the next crucial step is understanding the commercial lease itself. Having the right team—a commercial real estate broker and an attorney—who specializes in negotiating leases for commercial spaces will help advise what should be included in the lease document to protect you and your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractors, consulted the experts to define these elements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, a landlord provides the first version of the lease, which will (obviously) favor the landlord and is often derived from a template. Oftentimes, the landlord will use a template. Commercial real estate broker with Compass, Alex Cohen, explains, “The commercial real estate advisor negotiates all the key business terms on behalf of a tenant before a lease is prepared or an attorney is engaged by the tenant. Once a lease is drawn, the advisor can confirm all of the agreed business terms are accurately conveyed in the lease and can assist the attorney in the negotiation of legal terms.” While the lease should include everything previously discussed in the term sheet, your attorney should perform a close review, checking that you are clear on the terms and making any necessary adjustments so that the lease is more favorable to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Something to keep in mind: There are important differences between residential and commercial agreements. If you are familiar with residential leasing, you may make (incorrect) assumptions about commercial leases based on that experience. One major difference is that residential renters have rights under the law—to heating and repairs, for example. In a commercial tenancy situation, the landlord does not have to provide heat or make repairs unless it is stipulated in the lease. Read on for the specifics of what is typically included in a commercial lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Base rent, steps, and escalations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rental amount on a commercial lease is calculated via several variables. You are responsible for a base rent, which is the minimum amount of rent you pay. This is often calculated on a yearly basis and based on the rent per rentable square foot, a term explained below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For office tenants in New York, the square footage for which a business pays rent can be 30% to 40% greater than the square footage on which carpet can be laid and furniture installed. Rentable square feet for <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/office-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">office space</a> is usable area, plus a portion of the common areas adjusted by a market loss factor. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-guide-retail-renovation-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retail space</a>, however, is generally marketed and leased on a usable square foot (the actual square footage of space that is available to the tenant for its business use) basis. Loss factors are higher for partial-floor office spaces than for full-floor occupancies, because common areas like corridors, elevators, and lobbies are apportioned on divided floors into each tenant’s square footages. This means full floors are usually more efficient and cost-effective than partial-floor occupancies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to fixed increases in the base rent—typically every five years and referred to as &#8220;rent steps&#8221;— various mechanisms (“escalations”) exist that adjust the rent to be paid by the tenant during the term of the lease. Landlords want to ensure that they will continue to generate profit and will want the tenant to bear at least part of the responsibility for increased operating costs and higher taxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Additional rent for utility charges and services</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In New York City, base rent does not usually include electricity service. Utilities are usually charged by submetering, or through rent inclusion (though if you are fortunate, your space will have a separate meter and you pay the actual cost of electric usage directly to Con Edison). If your commercial space is not individually metered, you will have to buy electricity from the landlord, who usually marks it up. In submetering, you will pay a monthly electric charge (plus markup) to your landlord. With rent inclusion, the landlord includes a fixed charge for electricity lumped onto the rent, calculated per rentable square foot. This is a prime area for negotiation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other utilities such as water, gas, and heat, may be included in the rent or sub-metered. Typically this is decided based on building configuration and usage—if it is low, the landlord is usually happy to include it in the rent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also note that if the utilities are shared in the building, the landlord is only responsible for providing the utilities in the hours stated in the lease. For example, if you need to use the heat after hours, you may have to negotiate that separately and pay additional after-hours charges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another area of consideration is cleaning services for your rented space. There are typically three options: 1) landlord includes the service as part of the rent; 2) landlord has a preferred vendor who you pay out-of-pocket; or 3) you obtain cleaning services on your own (or clean the space yourself!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Terms of the lease</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In commercial real estate, a “short-term” lease is considered anything under five years, whereas a “long-term lease” is anything longer than five years and often for a 10-plus year period. You will decide what kind of lease works for your business based on how stable it is, and how long you think the location will work for your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In tandem with the length of the lease, also pay close attention to the assignment and subletting rights. If you need the flexibility to assign or sublet your space, in case you need to move your business or unexpectedly close it, then you want to make sure the process is not unnecessarily onerous. Every lease requires the landlord&#8217;s consent to sublease unless you are renting desk space to another firm and this is permitted in the lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lease concessions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is common for leases to include a rent-free period and a tenant improvement allowance (TIA) for use during the contractor build-out of the interior, particularly if the landlord is providing a raw space. Alternatively, the landlord might choose to renovate on behalf of a tenant, subject to their requirements; rent typically commences when the tenant assumes occupancy of the finished space. During times when the market favors tenants, landlords are often willing to provide funding for the build-out. The dollar amount is usually calculated based on the rentable square footage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the time, landlords are more willing to grant concessions when it is a long-term lease, because they are guaranteed income for a longer length of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with base rents, the market generally dictates lease concessions. But depending on the condition of the space and a tenant’s requirements and credit, these concessions can differ significantly on properties that have similar base rents. It’s important that your real estate broker understands your preferences so that many of these issues can be discussed upfront at or prior to the term-sheet stage and finalized by your attorney in the lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Renewal options</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are no automatic lease renewals in commercial real estate. Once your lease expires, there are also no caps on what the landlord can ask for the new rent. Of course, market conditions will influence how strong a position you are in to negotiate. One way to pre-empt this issue is to negotiate for an “option to renew” in your initial lease. Discuss and decide whether this will be a fixed increase or a “fair-market” rent increase, which is calculated by looking at comparable properties and transactions in the neighborhood and may be subject to arbitration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Permitted use</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make sure that your intended use of the property is permitted by the Certificate of Occupancy (issued by the Department of Buildings) as well as by zoning regulations. The lease needs to state clearly what the permitted uses are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security deposit and guarantees</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Landlords want a reliable tenant. They attempt to ensure this in a number of ways, including via security deposits and guarantees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are deemed somewhat risky, this will be reflected in the amount of security deposit the landlord will require upfront. Security deposits in many cases must be in the form of a letter of credit from your bank, and typically the first month’s rent is due at lease execution, even if there is a free rent period at the beginning of the lease. A corporate guarantee from a parent company that owns the corporate entity signing the lease and/or a “good guy” guaranty provided by a principal of the firm may also be required.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>From a traditional bank loan to equity crowdfunding, here are the options to fund your renovation</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_7416-Ariel-e1507234831356.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27522 size-chrono" title="retail store renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_7416-Ariel-723x482.jpg" alt="bank loan renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a>Retail shop, Spectre &amp; Co by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Joseph</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re looking to raise money to open a retail business or renovate an existing one, financing could come from many different directions. More than 50 percent of small businesses reported that they preferred borrowing from a bank, followed by using savings, and accessing a government-backed bank loan from the Small Business Administration (SBA), according to The Hartford&#8217;s latest report from 2015. There are also nontraditional forms of funding that are growing in popularity. Those opening restaurants, salons, or an office space will likely look into the same avenues for funding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each type will have its pros and cons whether it&#8217;s a typical bank loan or a newer option like equity crowdfunding. Whichever way you choose, it is always best to do your research and make an extremely calculated decision so that borrowing capital can be a smooth stepping stone to a bigger, grander enterprise. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching commercial renovators with vetted general contractors, offers some avenues of financing to consider for your business renovation project.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Bank</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s start with the obvious: a business loan from your local bank. The bar can be pretty high when it comes to getting your hands on this capital. Typically banks will require a high credit score as well as a good track record when it comes to running either your current business or previous businesses. “These are good for businesses that have been operating and have demonstrated they are profitable and in growth mode,” said Andrew Flamm from <a href="https://www.pacesbdc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pace University Small Business Development Center</a>, a nonprofit that advises small business owners and entrepreneurs. For successful retail businesses looking to expand to more locations or improve the existing space, a bank loan is a great option.</p>
<p><strong>Small Business Administration Loans</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Small Business Administration loans are similar to bank loans. They come through a regular commercial bank but thanks to the federal government acting as a guarantor, they can be easier to get (note: easier does not mean easy). SBA loans suit those who might almost qualify for a common business loan. The government’s willingness to step in as guarantor helps push the bank over the lending line, said Flamm. One downside is there can be copious amounts of paperwork to fill out, according to Gary Levy, who works with restaurateurs through the firm <a href="https://www.cohnreznick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CohnReznick</a>. And even with the federal government backing the loan, the bank will still look into your credit history and business experience, but perhaps not to the same extent as a standard business loan, he said. The <a href="https://americassbdc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Small Business Development Centers</a> have offices throughout the U.S. and are funded mostly by the SBA. There are seven SBDC <a href="https://www.nyssbdc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">locations</a> in New York City.</p>
<p><strong>Community Development Financial Institutions Fund</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CDFI is another government initiative with the goal of revitalizing communities with healthy small businesses. Funding sources come from federal dollars and some private sector capital. There are about 1,000 CDFI locations around the country and each can have a different mission, according to Amy Bunton from the <a href="https://www.pathwaywbc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pathway Women’s Business Center</a>. The fund provides assistance to specific geographic areas and communities in need of revitalization. Some might provide assistance and lending to women, immigrants, and minorities. “CDFI’s are designed to help entrepreneurs take advantage of opportunities that traditional lenders can’t,” said Bunton. “They offer flexible terms and rates while also often providing educational services to their borrowers.” At Pathway Women’s Business Center, entrepreneurs can take courses and connect with a mentor along with finding financing.</p>
<p><strong>Friends and Family</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Asking for investments or a gift from friends and family is a common way to raise funds for a business. This is a good option if you’re a new entrepreneur and unlikely to get funding from a bank or with an SBA loan, according to Levy from CohnReznick. If it is an investment rather than a gift, how that investment will be paid out can go a myriad of ways. You will also have to decide if you take money from one investor or many. If it is one investor, then you will need to negotiate if that person gets any control in how you run your business. On the other hand, “if you have 20 different investors then that is a lot of people to manage,” Levy said.</p>
<p><strong>Crowdfunding</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Websites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo can be a gold mine for businesses wanting capital to start or expand. These sites allow you to pitch your idea on their website and people pledge money to your project often in exchange for a reward. Perhaps you are expanding your clothing store so you might give a limited edition t-shirt as a reward to those who pledge $100.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tens of thousands of dollars have been raised this way, even millions. It can act as a marketing campaign for your business, and generate press and social media buzz, said Flamm from Pace. “You have to outline who you are, what you are doing, and why people want to be a part of it,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the flipside, a crowdfunding campaign can be a lot of work. During the campaign—the average length is about 45 days—expect to be promoting it heavily and answering plenty of questions from potential pledgees. Crowdfunding platforms also take a small slice of what your campaign brings in, which is five percent at Kickstarter. And one last thing, on some platforms if you don’t make the goal you set for your campaign, you will not get any of the funds pledged. So, think strategically before launching a crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Equity Crowdfunding</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In May 2016, Title III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups legislation went into effect allowing anyone to try their hand as a venture capitalist. Previously, US law prevented investors with a net worth below $1 million and who earn less than $200,000 from investing in private companies in exchange for equity, according to <a href="https://fortune.com/2016/05/16/title-iii-jobs-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortune</a>. That law change has paved the way for equity crowdfunding. Instead of businesses offering rewards for monetary gifts, like in regular crowdfunding, they can now offer equity and often in bite-sized pieces. For example, Republic Restoratives, a distillery in Washington D.C., raised $300,000 through 600 investors on Indiegogo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, businesses need to be prepared to put their financial information and the health of their business up on a website for the world to see. “If you’re an existing business and you’re not doing so well, you have to lay out all your financials,” said Alek Marfisi from <a href="https://upwindstrategies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upwind Strategies</a>, a small business consulting firm. “Some businesses like to appear bigger than they actually are.” Since investments are often small, budding ventures, capitalists in equity crowdfunding are often attracted to “cool” projects, like a distillery, according to Marfisi. So, a business that is a solid investment but seems mundane might not attract the funding it should.</p>
<p>The myriad of financing options offers opportunities for start-ups to established companies. Do your research and you&#8217;ll be one step closer to getting your dream business to the next level.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: What is Fool’s Gold Records and how did the brand begin?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ben Jacobs, Fool&#8217;s Gold Records:</strong> The company was founded by two DJs, A-trak and Nick Catchdubs, as a Brooklyn-based record label in 2007. We&#8217;ve morphed into a retail brand and a bit of a marketing agency, but first and foremost we&#8217;re a record label.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26311 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-Before-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="1085" />Original retail shop on Metropolitan Ave in Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: What led to the opening of a brick-and-mortar store?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR: </strong>We felt it was important to have a retail presence as an extension of the brand and the art that we create. Our first retail store and offices were actually in the same space on Metropolitan in Brooklyn. We were making tee shirts and either selling them online or tossing them off stage at shows. We decided, “Let’s take advantage of this space and open it up to the public.” It was a success and just came to a point where we outgrew it and it was a little too small to do enough with it. I happened to walk by this building—147 Grand Street—and saw a big open space for rent. The wheels started turning and we decided to come up with a new space that was more functional for how the brand was evolving.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-Before-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26309 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-Before-05-723x482.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="482" /><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How does your new retail space represent your brand? Why did you need to leave your former location? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR:</strong> The old space was very narrow. Everything was fixed and there wasn’t much room to grow. The idea for the new space was not only to be bigger but a little bit more modular. For events, we have the flexibility to pull the podiums out or move the DJ booth over a bit. We’re doing art shows, workshops for kids, and DJ workshops—a range that ties into New York’s creative, arts and music community.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26248 size-chrono" title="DJ booth" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-03-723x482.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26252 size-chrono" title="retail shop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How was your vision executed by working with Sweeten? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR:</strong> I worked closely with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Sweeten contractor</a> who did the work to make the space a reality. We had a pretty defined concept visually, but it was a bit up in the air in terms of how we were going to execute it. These enfilades that we’re sitting under, these three structures, were an experiment. We had to figure out how we were going to get the polycarbonate to stand and be sturdy and supported during events. Due to the nature of a lot of the materials we selected, there was a fair amount of trial and error and I appreciated the contractor&#8217;s willingness to experiment until we found the right methods and his patience throughout the process. We wouldn’t have been able to do that without him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">&#8220;The enfilades were a simple way to get a strong view right when you walk in. It also takes all the aspects of Fool&#8217;s Gold and puts them on display individually, sort of like laying out the ingredients for a recipe.&#8221; &#8211; Designer Dong-Ping Wong</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How did you, as a client, work with Sweeten?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR: </strong>We found Sweeten through our designer, Family New York. I definitely noticed how quickly and efficiently we were able to get bids and that it wasn’t a disjointed process. From the receiving end, it was like, “Wow! We’ve got a lot of general contracting options here, and a lot of good people who are interested in this job. Great!” It simplified the process and gave us a very strict and transparent way of comparing our options and what’s out there. During the renovation, there was a lot of communication with our Sweeten contractor—emails, calls, weekly meetings. He was very involved in the process and genuinely concerned with making sure it turned out exactly as we were hoping.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do you think Sweeten can help small business owners like yourself?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR:</strong> Sweeten helps business owners by simplifying and demystifying the process a bit. It’s pretty daunting if you’ve never been through the renovation process before. So you&#8217;ll have questions like, “Where do I start? What are the first steps? When do I know I’m done?” All these different questions you have going into it kind of blind. It definitely takes a bit of the edge off of figuring out what to do and if you’re feeling a little bit lost.</p>
