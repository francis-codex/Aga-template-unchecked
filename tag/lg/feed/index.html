										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>If you thought this appliance was indispensable now, features like self-cleaning, an integrated sink, and a mini washer will wash your socks right off</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DavisonKitchen-06_Crop.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22857 size-chrono" title="washing machine" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DavisonKitchen-06_Crop-723x506.jpg" alt="washing machine" width="723" height="506" /></a>(Above) A washing machine tucked under the counter in Davison and Bernice&#8217;s kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doing laundry is unavoidable, but happily, washing machines are doing more of the heavy lifting for you. Digital controls, cycles tailored for everything from delicates to lycra to bath towels, vibration reduction, and childproof locks make wash day safer and less of a chore. While innovation breakthroughs have not gone so far as to make washing machines touchless, like some other appliances, there are more than a few new features that further reduce the time spent while increasing efficiency. Here’s a rundown:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The pros of front-loading</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The washing machine with the door that opens from the front, as opposed to the top, is not brand new; Europeans have enjoyed this feature for decades. However, it is becoming more widely available from manufacturers. The advantages: Front-loading machines require less water, can take more clothes, and tend to clean more gently and thoroughly than their top-loading counterparts. Top-loaders wash with the help of an agitator. Versions without the agitator are high-efficiency (HE) washers. Like front-loaders, they use less water, have larger capacities, require more time to wash, and spin faster, too, wringing out more water to save drying time later. They also cost more than the agitator version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Automatic dispensers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This receptacle releases detergent, bleach, and fabric softener, each at the appropriate time, so you don’t have to hang around waiting for just the right moment. Every minute saved is a minute you get back to do something else.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Self-cleaning and low maintenance</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Water will collect in the machine, particularly front-loading models, without evaporating if you wash frequently, creating a risk of mildew and bacteria. New technology now keeps washers fresh, without introducing chemicals, through a combination of soaking, pulsating, and high-speed spinning. And you thought self-clean was just for ovens!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23154 size-chrono" title="two-in-one washer and dryer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="washing machine" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) Tim and Lindsay&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/overhauling-upper-west-side-co-op-make-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-in-one washer and dryer</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Load capacity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Capacities for front- and top-loading machines can range from about 3.8 cubic feet up to 6 cubic feet. Your habits for doing laundry—weekly loads of towels or sports clothes versus say, small loads separated by color—will guide your decision. Larger capacity machines help cut down the number of washes you run. Expect to pay more for these models.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Steam wash</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Released from inside the washer, steam helps remove stains without pretreatment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Secondary access door</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have a top loader and you stumble upon that missing dirty sock, no problem. But what if your machine is a front loader? Now you’re in luck: Last year saw the introduction of a front-loading model with a secondary access door that lets you add small items mid-wash from Samsung.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-55-AFTER.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27425 size-chrono" title="washer and dryer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-55-AFTER-723x482.jpg" alt="washing machine" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) A <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-basement-turns-into-family-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">front-loading washer and dryer</a> in Cristiana&#8217;s laundry room located in the basement of her home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Integrated sink</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’ve ever soaked clothing with a pesky stain, you’ve probably had the experience of rushing with the drippy item from the sink to the washing machine, then going back to wipe up soapy water on the floor. No more. Samsung makes a top-loading machine with a hinged sink on top of the wash drum. A water jet aids the soaking or scrubbing; when the item is ready for the wash, lift the sink to drop the clothing through a slot at the back and into the machine, then begin the cycle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Two-in-one machine</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you like to wash small loads of a particular color, or can’t wait to launder those sweaty gym clothes; the two-in-one machine is for you. In addition to a central or primary drum, there’s another smaller drum at the base or top of the machine. You can run both washers simultaneously or independently, as needed. LG also offers a compact washer that can be retro-fitted to an existing machine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Black stainless steel finish</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Less industrial looking than its silvery-colored older sibling, black stainless steel makes a stylish statement in the laundry room, joining the ranks of ever-classic white, and some colors, too, which you may find on the market for a few seasons.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24391 mb-10 size-chrono" title="refrigerator" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12-723x534.jpg" alt="refrigerator" width="723" height="534" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12-723x534.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12-300x222.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12-600x443.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span class="img-label">Kristen’s FrenKristen&#8217;s French door refrigerator bottom-mount freezer in her <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/gallery-director-perfectly-curates-apartment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovated Chelsea kitchen</a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s probably the most frequently visited place in your home. It’s the hub of the kitchen. It’s the refrigerator. No other appliance sees so much action. To keep up with all of the demands made on this hard-working member of the household, manufacturers are devising new features and improvements to provide more flexibility and responsiveness. From precise climate control to wireless connectivity, the refrigerator has even greater capacity to keep food fresh and to alert you when items need replacing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While some of these innovations may not be mandatory to a functioning kitchen, they are nevertheless time-saving. They also happen to be fun.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><b>Door configurations</b></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The arrangement of doors and drawers on your refrigerator, or refrigerator/freezer, are not just a style choice. The configuration directs how you use the fridge, and what foods you reach for most often. Classic arrangements still exist—side-by-side, bottom-mount, column—as well as newer styles, like French door and drawers. When choosing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">style</span></a>, first make a checklist of all the things you and your family take from the fridge in a given day. Each configuration has its benefits:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">*Side-by-side</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Giving access to the freezer on one side and the fridge on the other, this type is the most popular category now. The tall slender doors are also good for kitchens with little clearance space. The narrower sides do mean you lose the capacity to stow wide items like pizza boxes and party trays.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">*Bottom-mount freezer</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the freezer on the bottom, the main compartments remain at eye level, a no-brainer when the fridge is accessed more frequently than the freezer. For those times when you need the freezer just as often—during a big party, over the summer, or for frozen snacks—some fridges with two upper doors can be reprogrammed so that one side becomes the freezer, temporarily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several manufacturers, like <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/home-appliances" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LG</a>, <a href="https://www.geappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GE</a>, and <a href="https://www.mieleusa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miele</a>, offer double lower freezer drawers; one of the drawers can be converted to a fridge or freezer as needed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*French door</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A variation of the bottom-mount freezer category, this model features two half-doors that open from the center (like a side-by-side), also good if you have less clearance when a door opens. You’ll still be able to get the full-width shelves in the inner compartment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*Column</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This refrigerator comes in a variety of widths so it can be installed wherever you want for a customized kitchen layout. Add a column freezer next to it or a couple of under-counter freezer drawers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*Door-in-door</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frequent opening of the fridge door is inevitable. This leads to strain on the cooling system and a risk to food placed at the front. If yours is the family that goes in and out all day for drinks, check out the fridge from LG with the upper door that opens with the push of a button to access a slender outer beverage compartment. A tinted glass panel lets you see inside with two knocks on the glass, for those who like to graze with a gaze while deciding what they want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*Drawers</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Undercounter</a></span><span class="s1"> refrigerator drawers are handy for a variety of situations, including small kitchens without much wall space, as well as a large kitchen requiring more fridge capacity for dedicated items, like drinks and snacks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*Top-mounted freezer</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This type falls into the most economical category (remember your starter apartment?). However, it offers the least capacity, and you have to bend over to retrieve most items in the fridge. Not so cool.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cooling for all</b></span></p>
<p id="m_6442250483863752054yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1497642992296_10103">The constant opening and closing of the fridge places a burden on the cooling system of the refrigerator and on the food inside. The variety of items also presents a challenge, as not all perishables keep well at the same temperature—or even together in the same drawer. Some foods, placed together, can even speed each other’s spoilage.</p>
<p id="m_6442250483863752054yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1497642992296_10105">Manufacturers have responded with independent humidity and temperature control for compartments. Miele makes a refrigerator with drawers that offer individual microclimates. With the touch of an icon, the drawer will keep lettuce crisp one week and safely store cheese another. Jenn-Air has a quick-chill feature that lowers the temperature to below liquid freezing for one hour, great for that spur-of-the-moment bottle of wine.</p>
<p id="m_6442250483863752054yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1497642992296_10196">Some new fridges come with separate cooling circuits for refrigeration and freezing sections. The benefit: Independent control of each section contributes to peak function. Since there’s no air exchange between compartments, it also keeps food from drying out. <a href="https://www.subzero-wolf.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.subzero-wolf.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1497730836836000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9637qnK0KHCvDfmC45nx5IwTHQg">Sub-Zero</a> has introduced an antimicrobial filtration system that clears airborne bacteria and prevents the transferring of odors or ethylene gas (emitted by some vegetables) that can speed food spoilage.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Connect with your appliance</b></span></p>

You might also be able to access recipes from a popular cooking site and have the recipe read to you as you work at the prep counter.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* Remote manufacturing of ice ordered from your mobile phone</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* An integrated compartment that holds fruit for infused water</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* High-capacity ice maker</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* Sparkling water dispenser</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Probably no other appliance in the kitchen can combine so many innovations as the refrigerator. The future points toward the development of more special features, some that we can’t even imagine yet. In the meantime, you can, at a minimum, enjoy state-of-the-art cooling systems that save you money on electricity and grocery bills. And that’s always cool.</span></p>

<p>The fridge is easily the most-used appliance in the kitchen, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be the centerpiece. With <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom paneling</a>, your fridge can blend into its surroundings and let another feature, like a standout <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island</a>, take center stage.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kitchen expansion</a> in a studio apartment in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Giovanni, a Brooklyn-based doctor was looking to trade in his modern high-rise lifestyle for something with more history. This new studio, in a historic townhouse, offered original wood floors and the promise of exposing structural bricks beneath the plaster. The very basic and uninspired kitchen, however, was a distinct liability. Shoved into a shallow alcove, it had entry-level appliances and only a few inexpensive cabinets.<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Giovanni’s co-op approved his renovation proposal to combine a small closet and the alcove into an open plan for both cooking and laundry, so he turned to Sweeten for his project. His <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> helped shape the vision, and was “very good at telling me what was feasible.” Giovanni says. Breaking the plaster surface off structural brick walls proved an inexpensive way to add texture to the plain-vanilla apartment. Enlarging the kitchen footprint slightly, he added an eat-in peninsula to hide the washer-dryer while keeping pipes in roughly the same position. The backsplash is clad with matte gray subway tiles. To keep costs down, black-painted butcher block countertops offer a warmer temperature than stone. Overhead, a dropped ceiling provided space for new electrical wiring, for the high-tech pendants over the breakfast bar and for recessed lighting.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Glossy white cabinets look lush, and using stainless trim above lifts the dropped ceiling by helping it appear to float.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: <a href="https://www.geappliances.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE</a> appliances, <a href="https://www.lg.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG</a> compact combo washer-dryer, <a href="https://www.build.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kichler</a> pendant lighting from Build.com, matte-grey subway tiles for the backsplash.</p>
