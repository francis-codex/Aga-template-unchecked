<h3>Getting organized for a new home</h3>
<p>Buying and renovating a fixer-upper is one way to attain both the desired square footage and location at a more affordable price. If you are buying with the intent to renovate, cost is not the only item to consider. Use your time efficiently by syncing the construction timeline with the closing schedule. When do you bring in the architect and general contractor?</p>
<p>Here, Sweeten offers a practical guide to juggling a purchase PLUS a renovation. <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1000px-Graph-Timeline-new.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a> to download our guide.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h4>Bidding on the home you want</h4>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Speak with a mortgage broker or lender</strong></span> (1 – 3 weeks) Determine how you want to pay for your renovation. A construction-to-permanent loan allows you to finance your renovation as part of your mortgage application in one go versus two separate processes.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hire a real estate attorney</strong></span> (3 days – 2 weeks)</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Find your new home and make an offer</strong></span> (1 – 4 months) Take into consideration how much of a reno budget you’ll have after the purchase. On the reno front, decide the time/budget of what you can afford. (Don’t forget about closing costs; your agent and attorney can guide you on the cost range.) Keep in mind how long you want to carry a property after closing. You will most likely be paying for housing elsewhere unless you plan on roughing it in the unrenovated space.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Negotiate the offer</span></strong> (2 days – 2 weeks) In the meantime, read up on how much labor and materials cost, along with the average home renovation costs on Sweeten&#8217;s blog. You can get a head start filling out your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project details on Sweeten</a> to better understand what you need. ie) alteration agreement, building insurance requirements, space dimensions for the renovation). Then, post your project after you close on your property.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Inspect and sign the contract</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Schedule and conduct an inspection</span></strong>, if applicable. In a competitive market, this is a contingency a buyer may choose to forgo to make their bid more attractive. This can also be done while negotiating the offer (1 – 2 days). If you’re buying to renovate, you’ll want to know what will be possible to change, given existing conditions. You may not care whether the appliances are working or if the walls are orange. However, you’ll want to know about the state of the electrical and plumbing systems and if upgrading them is possible. The inspection will provide additional insight into the condition of the apartment and the building.</li>
<li>If you plan on moving walls, you’ll need an architect or a designer.</li>
<li>Get a heads-up about other financial or building issues. If the inspector tells you the apartment building needs a new roof or boiler, for example, look into whether there will be an assessment levied or if money has already been raised. With an assessment, you’ll bear the expense as the new owner. This may cut into your renovation budget. The same goes for a house: if there are pressing repairs, you’ll foot the whole bill.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Have your attorney conduct due diligence</span></strong> (2 weeks) At the same time, the attorney should also review the alteration agreement to make sure nothing prohibits you from the vision you have planned. ie) Checking the wet-over-dry rules if you plan to relocate the kitchen.</li>
<li>In a house, be certain zoning will allow the renovation plans you have. ie) If you’re in a landmarked district, you’ll be restricted in what you can do to the home’s exterior.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Start your general contractor search</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sign the contract to your new home</span></strong> (5 – 7 business days) Now’s the time to post your renovation project to Sweeten with details about your wish list, budget, and timeline. You’ll be matched to vetted general contractors based on scope, location, and budget. Review your contractors’ past work and testimonials.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apply for a mortgage and receive a commitment</span></strong> (3 – 6 weeks) Reach out to your contractor(s) and set up site visits. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1547733600445000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFf3D_3jxrQlCkBMCOPt2c_uyLllA">Here’s how to prepare for it</a>.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Complete and submit your co-op/condo application package</span></strong> (10 – 20 business days or within 3 days of receiving mortgage commitment)</li>
<li>Keep the conversation going and negotiate the terms of the renovation budget, timeline, and other contractual details with your Sweeten contractor. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1547733600445000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHNMr1b7gq5whQAAI2b3ocPvQvgw">Here’s a primer on how to evaluate different bids</a> (Sweeten can help you bid-level for free).</li>
<li>What are the contractors’ schedules for the coming quarter/6 months? Where would your project could fit in? You&#8217;ll want the contractor to start immediately after your closing date.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Board approval and begin your renovation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Meet for a board interview</span></strong> (this can take anywhere from 1 week to a few months).</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Receive board approval</span></strong> (again, be prepared for a wait time from 1 week to a few months after the board interview).</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Schedule a closing</span></strong> (2 weeks after approval). Once your closing is scheduled, let your general contractor know so that room can be made in the schedule for your project to begin. Also check out our article on <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/what-to-ask-a-general-contractor-before-renovating/">what to ask a GC before renovating</a>.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The keys to your new home are in hand!</strong></span> Sign the contract with your Sweeten contractor. If you’re in a condo or co-op, you’ll also need to get the renovation approved by the board.</li>
</ul>
<p>When buying and renovating a fixer-upper, some overlap exists between your renovation and your property purchase schedules. The bulk of the renovation process that happens prior to closing is prep work. Use this time to educate yourself about costs and processes. Begin the search for contractors and who would be the best fit for your project.</p>
<p>While you can lay this groundwork, don’t pull the trigger until you own the property (you never know what might happen!). <span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These homes were stuck in the past until a (long overdue!) home renovation brought each one back to the future</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners who are feeling ambitious and want to take on a home that hasn’t been changed in decades have a unique opportunity. In an older home that’s been given new life, updated features sit alongside quirky and charming details from the past, such as crown molding and arched doorways. This kind of home renovation where the marriage of old meets new provides all the benefits of a modern space while retaining the character that can only come from a place that has a history. Below, three Sweeten homeowners take on the challenge of revamping older homes—and the results are truly magical.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25404 size-chrono" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><br />

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank">Meredith’s townhouse</a>, built in 1941</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meredith set out to find a fixer-upper and fell in love with a two-family brick Tudor townhouse in Kensington that only had one owner since 1941. With good bones and plenty of personality in the form of arched doorways and a 1950s Caloric stove, the home had potential, but it also required intensive repairs. Lead paint, cloth-wrapped aluminum <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-electrical-work-costs/" target="_blank">electrical wiring</a>, and old steel windows all had to go. Meredith found a contractor on Sweeten and started her renovation, focusing on maintaining some of the ‘40s charm while making necessary functional updates. A new kitchen was designed around the old stove, and in keeping with the theme of nostalgia, Meredith installed a salvaged Sub-Zero fridge and vintage enamel sink. The Pepto-Bismol pink bathrooms were redone in a much more tasteful palette of muted blues and received all new fixtures. Upstairs, the renovation included converting the second kitchen into a master bath, building a nursery, and updating the master bedroom and closet. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the rest of this lovely townhouse.</p>

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank">Ron’s postwar apartment</a> and home of 40 years</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ron lived in his Upper East Side postwar apartment for 40 years before making the decision to renovate. He worked closely with his interior designer, who came to Sweeten to find a contractor to complete their team. The plan consisted of a total gut renovation of the kitchen as well as painting the apartment, stripping and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank">refinishing floors</a>, cleaning up the crown molding in the living room, and adding custom millwork to hide old radiator units. He decided against joining the kitchen and living room and instead chose to keep the kitchen enclosed and add finishes that would make it feel larger and brighter. With all new appliances from Thermador, including a refrigerator<strong>, </strong>gas range, hood, and dishwasher, the kitchen got the functional upgrade it desperately needed. Architectural details in the kitchen mixed well with traditional <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank">custom cabinets</a> and beveled countertops for a refreshed yet classic style. In the living room, custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank">built-ins</a> with ample shelving were built to show off Ron’s collection of art and treasures from around the world. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the rest of Ron’s home, including his updated bedroom and bath.</p>

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia’s 1929 apartment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that underwent a mid-&#8217;80s renovation<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years after moving into her Upper East Side apartment, Claudia felt ready to renovate. It had been three decades since the apartment’s last home renovation, which had brought with it dated finishes, carpeting, and boxy built-ins. Claudia wanted to highlight the original bones of the home that had been covered up, reclaim some of the square footage lost to the old built-ins, and install some much-needed electrical outlets. She also ripped up the 30-year-old carpeting, uncovering original parquet floors. The windows in the living room were combined, allowing the space to become flooded with natural light, and the built-in surrounding the fireplace was demolished, revealing a wood-burning hearth. Crown molding was designed and placed along doorways, windows, ceilings, and floors to evoke some of the lost 1920s charm. To brighten up her home, the walls of the apartment were <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank">painted</a> white, replacing the dark green shade that had ruled the living room for decades. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see her updated kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom.</span></p>
