				<h3><b>What is a general contractor? </b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General contractors, known more simply as contractors or &#8220;GCs”, are the lead professionals on major construction projects. They oversee teams of subcontractors such as carpenters, plumbers, electricians, and painters, who carry out the various specialized aspects of each construction job. They’re responsible for procuring materials, obtaining permits, and ensuring that a project is completed according to plan. Depending on the specific requirements of a given project, they may also be responsible for coordinating with architects or designers, coop or condo boards, engineers, expediters, or inspectors. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term “general contractor” can be used interchangeably to refer to an individual person or a general contracting company. These companies come in all shapes and sizes, from one- and two-person operations, to mid-sized companies of 10-20 employees, and even large firms of 50 employees or more. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your area or region, general contractors may also be known as home improvement contractors, builders, renovation contractors, or remodeling contractors. </span></p><h4><span style="font-weight: 600;">What makes a <em>great</em> general contractor? </span></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Sweeten, we’ve been vetting and working closely with general contractors for over a decade. In addition to our </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7-step contractor vetting process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, here’s what we think gives some contractors that extra edge</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Inter, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and a reputation of satisfied clients:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Communication</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: There are a lot of variables in the construction process. A great general contractor understands the dynamic environment in which they work, anticipates potential issues, and is proactive in communicating all of this with their clients. They can provide clear instructions to subcontractors and are open to feedback. </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Realism</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The best general contractors are honest with clients about what their budget can realistically achieve, and will work with them to create a feasible scope of work, so that they can adhere to budgets and timelines. </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Agility: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the unforeseen inevitably happens on a major project, great contractors can think critically on their feet and approach their clients with proposed solutions. They can handle a variety of tasks and adapt to changes.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Eye for detail</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A great contractor does not make excuses for shoddy work. They scan their jobs with a fine tooth comb, regularly looking for imperfections in craftsmanship and addressing them head on — not avoiding them and hoping their client doesn&#8217;t notice!</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tidiness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A great GC will clearly spell out the ways in which they intend to protect your home and personal belongings in their estimates &amp; contracts. If your GC doesn&#8217;t have a game plan for protecting your beloved possessions, look the other way!</span> </li></ul><h4><span style="font-weight: 600;">Typical remodeling projects</span></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll probably need to hire a general contractor if you’re planning a project like </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renovating a kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remodeling a bathroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, finishing a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/basement/renovations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">basement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/attic/renovations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adding a deck or patio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remodeling an entire home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">converting a garage into an accessory dwelling unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They focus on transformative projects that involve multiple trades, which is why you’ll typically only hire a general contractor for projects that cost $15,000 and up. </span></p><h4><span style="font-weight: 600;">Traditional general contractors vs design-build contractors</span></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A traditional general contractor oversees all of the build-related aspects of a given job. They are responsible for procuring materials, hiring subcontractors, and managing the construction process. While general contractors are not responsible for design work, some are happy to offer creative solutions to smaller-scale design challenges, or even produce basic renderings where advanced design services are not necessary. The level of creative input you can expect from a traditional contractor varies greatly from firm to firm. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A design-build company, on the other hand, is a company that takes responsibility for both the design and construction of a project. They typically have in-house architects and designers, as well as construction experts, that work together to create the plans and then carry out the construction. Where architectural design service is required, design-build companies are often the most efficient option, as they can take responsibility for the entire project from start to finish.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Sweeten, we work with both traditional and design-build contractors, and with so many firms that we cover a broad range of service offerings to meet your needs. </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post your project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to start connecting with our vetted, trusted contractors today! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>					</div>

				<h3><b>Why hire a qualified general contractor for your remodeling project?</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because remodeling projects are so expensive, you may be tempted to save money by making yours a DIY project or hiring unqualified labor at a discount, but cutting these types of corners carries major risks, including:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Inferior workmanship</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A DIYer or unqualified contractor may not have the necessary skills or experience to complete the project to a high standard. This can result in poor quality work that may need to be redone or repaired, which can be costly and time-consuming.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Code violations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Building codes and regulations exist to ensure the safety and stability of structures. A DIYer or unqualified contractor may not be familiar with these codes and could potentially make mistakes that violate them, leading to problems and costly repairs down the line.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Increased liability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If an accident or injury occurs on the job site and the contractor is found to be at fault, the homeowner may be held liable for any damages. This can be particularly risky if the person doing the work does not have the necessary insurance.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Delays and cost overruns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A DIYer or unqualified contractor may not have the knowledge or resources to accurately estimate the time and cost of a project. This can result in delays and unexpected expenses.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General contractors are there to ensure that your project is completed in a safe, efficient, and code-compliant manner. Additionally, contractors can tap their vast experience to provide valuable advice and guidance on how to best complete your project, including, importantly, helping to identify potential issues before they become major problems. </span></p><h4><span style="font-weight: 600;">What kind of training do contractors have? </span></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General contractors typically have a variety of training experiences, including classes, certifications, and on-the-job experience. Many general contractors have a degree in construction management or a related field, and may also have industry certifications from organizations such as the <a href="https://www.nahb.org/">National Association of Home Builders</a> or the American Institute of Constructors. Additionally, many general contractors gain experience through apprenticeships or hands-on experience working on construction sites. With such a wide range of training, they are able to bring a variety of skills and knowledge to the table, ensuring that any project they undertake is completed professionally and to the highest standards.</span></p><h4><span style="font-weight: 600;">What are the license requirements for contractors?</span></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The licensing requirements for general contractors in the United States vary from state to state, and often between local municipalities, so it’s important to look up your local requirements if you want to be sure what is required in your area. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most states have a state-wide license requirement for general contractors. The exact requirements vary by state, but usually include passing a written exam, providing proof of financial responsibility, and providing proof of experience in the construction field. In most cases, applicants must also provide proof of insurance, as well as a bond to guarantee their work. In some states, general contractors may also have to complete additional training or courses in order to obtain their license. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in California, general contractors must pass a written exam that covers state laws, construction codes, and business practices. They must also provide proof of financial responsibility and experience in the construction field. In addition, they must complete a 16-hour pre-licensing course and a 4-hour exam prep course in order to obtain their license. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, in Texas, there is no statewide license required for general contractors. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, if you&#8217;re in a major metro area that metro may issue a license, which may also correspond with a county license. Or, you may live in a town or city that has specific licensing or permitting requirements that general contractors hold for a set amount of time or on a per-job basis. </span></p>					</div>

				<h3><b>How much does it cost to remodel with a general contractor? </b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A combination of service level, experience, and factors like firm size and overhead might all contribute to how competitive a contractor’s pricing is. General contractors make money by charging a fee for their services, which may include a commission or markup on any materials purchased and labor costs. They may also charge additional fees for project management, risk management, or other services. The general contractor&#8217;s fee, whether a flat rate or a percentage of the total project cost, is usually negotiated with the client prior to the start of the project. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have an extensive library of </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-cost-guides/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remodeling cost guides</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you plan your project budget, plus hundreds of additional </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/category/process-and-planning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renovation process and planning guides</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

				<h3><span style="font-weight: 600;">How do you hire a general contractor? </span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve come to the right place — helping people hire the right contractor for their remodeling project is exactly what we do at Sweeten! Here’s a breakdown of the process. </span></p><h4><span style="font-weight: 600;">1. Source 3-5 contractors who are fit for the job </span></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is so much easier said than done! You’ll want to research and narrow down a handful of qualified general contractors, with the right experience, who work in your area, who provide the services you need, at your budget level, and who are available and interested in the job. You could start by asking friends or researching online, and making some phone calls — however, if you’re in one of </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/locations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten’s service areas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we highly recommend that you save yourself the legwork and </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">start meeting trusted contractors on Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p><h4><span style="font-weight: 600;">2. Hold site visits</span></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule and hold a separate meeting at your project site with each of the contractors you’d like to get a bid from. This is your chance to learn more about their firm and evaluate how well you think you’d work together with them. Come prepared with questions! (Hint: we made you a list below.) </span></p><h4><span style="font-weight: 600;">3. Collect estimates</span></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After your site visits — unless otherwise discussed — each contractor should prepare an estimate, or bid, for your project. This process can usually take 1-2 weeks, since they’ll need to coordinate with their subcontractors to prepare the document. </span></p><h4><span style="font-weight: 600;">4. Compare the bids</span></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no standard form for contractor estimates, so it’s rare that you can truly compare them apples to apples. Instead, you’ll need to comb through to get an idea of what is and is not included in each bid, ask some questions, and do your best to evaluate those differences. This is the critical decision-making stage, which is why </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/bid-leveling-call-for-renovation-estimates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we offer a free bid-leveling call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you make the best hiring choice for your project.</span></p><h4><span style="font-weight: 600;">5. Conduct negotiations</span></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, you should have a good idea of who you’d like to work with, but is there one or two items you’d love tweaked on their proposal before you’re ready to commit? This is your chance for that final conversation. </span></p><h4><span style="font-weight: 600;">6. Sign a contract and pay your deposit</span></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll seal the deal with a formal contract and <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/what-is-normal-deposit-for-a-general-contractor/">deposit</a>, which allows the contractor to begin acquiring the necessary materials ahead of your agreed-upon start date. We’ve made that process more convenient for you by offering </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/pay-safely-for-home-renovations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">secure, electronic deposits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when you sign with a Sweeten contractor. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re ready to hire a contractor, check out </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/locations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten’s service locations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see if we can get you connected with our trusted contractors today. Our personalized contractor matching service is totally free!</span></p><p></p><h4><span style="font-weight: 600;">Sample questions to ask at your site visits</span></h4><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long have you been a general contractor?</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many projects have you managed simultaneously?

But, what type of remodeling companies will you need to hire for your project? Do you only need to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/">hire a general contractor</a>, or would you benefit from reaching out to an architect, interior designer, or even a design-build contractor? The answer will vary d<span class="s1">epending on your project scope, your preferences, and your budget. </span></p><p><span class="s1">Knowing exactly who to reach out to, and when, will save you time in the hiring process — that means you can start enjoying your remodeled home sooner.</span></p><p>Every major renovation project requires a general contractor to oversee the daily construction work. Some renovations, however, also require a licensed architect for technical and design services. This can include creating the necessary drawings for your building board or Department of Buildings (or local equivalent) permits and approvals. Even when not required, some homeowners also opt to hire architects to provide <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-westchester-county-home-remodel-turns-into-a-top-notch-family-compound/">a level of style</a>, detail, and management. The added expense is sometimes estimated at 20% of the total project budget.</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s important to note that there can be overlap among design services. </span><span class="s1">For example, most home remodeling architects and interior designers can provide expertise for layout and finish materials, though these specifics can vary a lot from firm to firm. If you hire an interior designer who creates updated floor plans, they may secure the services of an architect to have them professionally &#8220;stamped&#8221; when required. </span></p><p>Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> <span class="s1">outlines what each renovation professional brings to the project.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48228" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Who-Do-I-Hire-Graph.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1100" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Who-Do-I-Hire-Graph.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Who-Do-I-Hire-Graph-273x300.jpg 273w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Who-Do-I-Hire-Graph-600x660.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><h3>When you should hire an architect</h3><p>You’ll <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-work-with-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">need an architect</a> if any of the following apply to your renovation:</p><ul><li>Changing the layout, making additions, or tearing down walls</li><li>Moving plumbing lines such as bathtub or dishwasher</li><li>Moving gas lines</li><li>Doing work on a landmark property</li><li>Any changes that require approval from the Department of Buildings</li></ul><h3>When you should hire a general contractor</h3><p>Hiring a general contractor may best suit your job if none of the above apply to your renovation. You would also have a general idea of what you’d like to do with the space. <span class="s1">Post your project at Sweeten where most contractors can give some guidance on design, materials, and creative solutions for tackling challenges. Alternatively, you can also request a design-build firm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p>NOTE: A remodeling contractor who is licensed ensures that the necessary level of checkpoints and screening processes have been met. More on this below.</p><h3>Benefits of hiring a design-build firm</h3><p>Design-build contractors can be a cost-effective option for medium to large-scale renovations. They also work well on any project that requires high <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/hudson-yards-renovation-updates-foyer-kitchen-bath/">attention to detail</a>. Design-build contractor teams offer:</p><ul><li>A full package of design, construction, and project management services</li><li>A single point of contact from start to finish</li><li>A fluid process with more predictable timelines between design and construction phases</li></ul><h3>When you should hire an interior designer</h3><p>If walls and room functions are not being altered dramatically, <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/how-much-does-an-interior-designer-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interior designer</a> can help with things like:</p><ul><li>Considering overall traffic flow, lighting, and space planning</li><li>Designing <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/">custom built-ins and cabinetry</a></li><li>Project management and purchasing of materials, fixtures, and appliances</li><li>Choosing furniture styles, color palette, and finishes</li></ul><h3>Why you should always hire a licensed general contractor</h3><p>A locally valid license and proper insurance are a must-have for any reliable general contractor. Your county or state website will list all licensed contractors in the licensing or consumer affairs sections. With <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/">Sweeten&#8217;s contractor vetting</a>, for example, a New York City-based contractor must have a valid Home Improvement Contractor (HIC) license. </p><h4>Getting cheaper bids from unlicensed remodeling contractors</h4><p>A note of warning to those tempted by the lower estimates of an unlicensed contractor: remodeling contractors without bonafide credentials may not be able to obtain the required permits for your job. Permits do cost money and take time to procure for any home renovation. However, if the contractor&#8217;s work fails to meet building codes, you will be responsible for the reconstruction. This can turn into an unpleasant surprise when homeowners who want to sell their home find out they must fix work that doesn&#8217;t meet permitting standards.</p><h4>Am I liable if I hire an unlicensed contractor?</h4><p>Allowing work on your property by an unlicensed remodeling contractor could also nullify your homeowner’s insurance policy. If the contractor doesn&#8217;t have workers’ compensation insurance, you become the de facto employer. You&#8217;ll be responsible for any accidents on the property (or anyone else’s property) if the contractor is negligent.</p><h3>Hire the best contractor for a home renovation</h3><p>Homeowners are rightfully concerned about how to tackle a renovation in an organized fashion. It&#8217;s best to build your team of renovation professionals based on the needs of your home renovation project, whether that involves architectural plans and permits, deciding the aesthetic or finishes, or all—or none—of the above.

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Erica</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to believe a wall can have such a profound impact on how two people share space. Our kitchen, once barely big enough for one person, was transformed into what kitchens are meant to be: the heart of the home. Our 800-square-foot Clinton Hill apartment was a loved space, in every sense of the word. My then-fiancé, Joshua, moved in and we decided to renovate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before Joshua joined me, I imagined what would happen if the wall between the living room and kitchen came down. Now that it was two of us, changes seemed necessary. Along with the wall, Joshua also dreamed of replacing the parquet floors with hardwood. (I much preferred parquet so those conversations often ended in agreeing to disagree.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our apartment and all its quirks and beauties were familiar. We knew how we used the space, and which areas needed to become a better fit. We had a<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> budget for the kitchen</a> and vision. But who could we trust to help us move forward with our ideas? Just choosing the right paint color felt overwhelming, so finding the right designer was a challenge. </span></p>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just choosing the right paint color felt overwhelming, so finding the right designer was a challenge.</span></i>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten.com, and selected a firm with design/build services. The general contractor was familiar with the</span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clinton Hill Co-ops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the complexities that exist in these apartments, which were originally constructed in the early 1940s. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44832 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that first warm fall evening, she sat in our living room and listened carefully as we described what we hoped our home would be. We knew we wanted to remove a wall, upgrade the contractor-grade cabinetry, replace the appliances, and install under-cabinet lighting. But we were unsure of the process and the things we could not see. After talking, she immediately popped up and put her superhero design tools to work—her x-ray vision which saw through walls, and her tape measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial sketches removed the wall between the kitchen and the dining area completely, as well as part of the wall between the kitchen and the living room. We were seeking to strike a balance between Joshua’s partiality to completely open spaces and my desire to keep some visual privacy. Receptive to our decision to keep the entire wall between the living room and kitchen intact, the plan removed only the wall between the kitchen and the dining area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our contractor’s keen eye helped us ask so many more questions about the space. I never noticed that the sightlines of our parquet floors were uneven and misaligned. (Joshua was right. We needed to replace the floors.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="tile backsplash" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22219" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized that the space would be transformed in ways I was not expecting the moment she began to speak of light from the kitchen window spilling into the back corner of the living room. With the wall down, of course, the kitchen window would be visible as you enter the apartment. The decision to move the refrigerator out of the original kitchen footprint into what was once a hallway closet provided more options on where the sink and dishwasher could be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew that our Sweeten contractor had expertise in millwork. Our kitchen, filled with unexpected nooks and crannies, was a design dilemma that custom cabinetry could solve. I envisioned white cabinetry to brighten up the kitchen, and we trusted our contractor’s desire to include natural wood via open shelving and some cabinetry with a walnut finish. The shelving she created is the perfect platform for us to display our spices, cookbooks, vases, and the all-important pilon for grinding plantains.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. “I’m so nervous,” I admitted.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a designer, she not only considered ways to bring more storage and surface area into the kitchen, but also a new hue. One afternoon we perused our choices at their warehouse in Queens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every tile seemed to fall short—wrong tint, incorrect size, too dominating, etc. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then Joshua’s eye caught a simple hexagonal tile of soft turquoise blue. This 3D recycled glass tile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complemented the cabinetry color, the wood finish, and it was the right size. The result is a beautiful canvas that pulls the white cabinetry and quartz countertops together. Last, but certainly not least, it serves as a surprising showcase for my favorite red cast iron Dutch oven.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making decisions was easy. Rather than ask us to look at every iteration of countertop or knob, our contractor presented us with a few options, and the design sensibility connected across the space. The nickel handles on the cabinet doors pick up the subtle specks of silver accents in the quartz countertops coordinating well with the steel appliances.  I only noticed it once the kitchen was complete. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to come up with secondary plans for overhead lighting since the ceiling was made of concrete. The</span><a href="https://www.cb2.com/"> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">floor lamp now illuminates our favorite round dining table. The gooseneck sconce creates the perfect corner for working on a laptop at our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/">kitchen peninsula</a>, which can now accommodate someone cooking at the same time. The peninsula also has generous storage on two sides—four very deep drawers and a small cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, when you walk into our apartment, three things jump out at you: the welcoming natural light that flows in from the windows, rich wood elements on the cabinetry and shelving, and the turquoise tile of the backsplash.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44834" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The builders and carpenters of our design-build firm are true craftspeople. The care with which they handled each task was notable. They produced perfectly mitered corners, laid the floor with precision, and cleaned up at the end of each day. We felt like we were in good hands the entire way through. I’d notice an imperfection, and before I could say anything, they had fixed it. Truly top-notch workmanship. They were so thoughtful about the space that it made our decision to stay in the apartment throughout the renovation easy. “Just think of it like camping,” Joshua said one night as we dined in our bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. “I’m so nervous,” I admitted. &#8220;Don’t worry,&#8221; she warmly replied. &#8220;You’re gonna love it.”  Debris and concrete walls filled much of the living area after the first demolition day, but we felt the homeyness of the space. The light from the newly visible window greeted us as we entered in a way we never expected. I looked at Joshua and said, “I didn’t realize how much of me was in this place. Now we get to create this space together.” We couldn’t relish it more!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Original flooring sets the color tone, while hidden storage provide max capabilities</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-26840" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Treanna_Kitchen-02-07.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Treanna_Kitchen-02-07" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Adding storage and style to a haphazard kitchen in Manhattan’s Upper East Side</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When Treanna embarked on the search for her new home, she knew that apartments within her budget would probably require a remodel of some kind. She set out to find one in which she would only need to redo one of the two big-ticket items—the kitchen or bath—but not both. When she saw the kitchen in her current apartment, located in a 1960s co-op building on the Upper East Side, she spotted a lot of underutilized space and a lot of potential. There was enough room for a full galley, while the current owners had only one wall of cabinets and appliances with a lone undersized fridge on the other side. All the appliances were rental-grade, and there was no dishwasher—a must for this enthusiastic home chef. The few cabinets that existed were mismatched, and the space flow was not good. As she closed on the apartment, Treanna <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached out to Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted contractors, and selected her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: While almost everything in the old kitchen had to go, Treanna found charm in the existing checkered black-and-white flooring, and it became the basis for the new color palette. She envisioned a calm, serene space in white and gray—anything dark would make the galley space feel too confined. “Open, inviting, and warm,” were the operative terms for the updated kitchen design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the guidance of her Sweeten design-build contractor, Treanna chose white <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a>, a light-colored Caesarstone <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertop</a> with a bit of marbling, and a backsplash in clear and white tile (although the gray grout tinted the look of the clear tiles). Minimalist hardware in stainless steel finished the look. Working with just 42 square feet, Treanna and her contractor outfitted the space with ample storage by adding four custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-out racks</a> in addition to numerous drawers. The stainless steel range and dishwasher were installed on one side, while the microwave and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/refrigerator-chill-world-fridge-freezer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refrigerator</a> went on the opposite wall. Although the remodel took much longer than expected due to delays with co-op approval, Treanna is loving her new space—especially the pull-outs and the handy Delta touch faucet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Instead of wasting the dead space behind the cabinet toe kicks, the Sweeten contractor added additional drawer space and an ingenious pull-out step stool on wheels. Treanna had trouble reaching the top shelves in the kitchen and this was a way to keep a step ladder out of sight but easily accessible.</p>

<p><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowners Cat and Jordan</i></p>
<h3>Making the space modern</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cat and Jordan closed on their 1,000-square-foot, co-op apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. They loved the prewar apartment&#8217;s location and proximity to the park. But, they were put off by the interior’s worn and outdated appearance. The color scheme—yellowy-beige walls against the bright red brick of a non-functioning fireplace and tired cherry cabinets—was not to their taste.</p>

<p>The walls had been repainted too many times to count. As a result, it had a “thick, uneven, mushroom-colored appearance.” The wiring, which lined around the baseboards, was nonfunctional. Layers of shiny yellow varnish obscured the parquet wood floors (which Cat was partial to, having grown up in a home with it).</p>
<p>The couple wanted to brighten up the space by stripping the walls and floors. Bookcases around the fireplace would add interest to the long span of wall. A new dark gray kitchen ticked the box of the “warm modern home with spare decorations&#8221; they wanted.</p>
<h3>Finding the right renovation team</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main goal was to make their apartment “look as big, bright, and clean as possible.” They were uncertain about how to turn their vision into reality. They weren&#8217;t &#8220;design people,&#8221; Cat admitted, and “needed a lot of guidance.” Posting their project on Sweeten, they found a contractor to provide the direction they needed. The couple described the process: “The contractor genuinely loves working with clients, explaining choices and limitations. He knew when to give us the ultimate stylistic decision and when to push back with his expert opinion.”</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26874 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="custom cabinets" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26869 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-03-723x482.jpg" alt="custom cabinets" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<h3>Installing dark gray kitchen cabinetry</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, they would create an elegant and functional design. Since the kitchen opens into the living room, it was important for the materials in both rooms to echo each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dark gray kitchen cabinetry contrasted with white quartz countertops and a stainless steel backsplash. Instead of handles, drawers had carved-out pull tabs for a streamlined look. The utensil drawers were made of natural walnut. Cat said, “I never thought that the inside of a drawer could, or even should, be beautiful, but I appreciate seeing the woodwork every time I reach for a utensil.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-06-08.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26871 mb-0 size-chrono" title="custom drawer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-06-08.gif" alt="custom drawer" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<h3>Adding a kitchen peninsula</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were some minor changes made as the demolition got underway. Originally, an island was planned for additional prep and storage space, but the demo revealed that the dividing wall couldn&#8217;t be knocked down. They scaled the island back to a <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen peninsula</a> with a smaller footprint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In the end,&#8221; they said, &#8220;the peninsula was perfect and very functional.” On the kitchen side, the peninsula held the kitchenware and cookware, along with a trash and recycling bin. On the dining room side, napkins, placemats, and cookbooks filled the cabinet space.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26870 size-chrono" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="custom cabinets" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26872 mb-0 size-chrono" title="custom cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="custom cabinets" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Prepare yourself for the possibility that something unexpected can happen during a renovation, especially in an old building.”
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Changing up format and flooring</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their Sweeten contractor suggested the modern and very useful reverse L-shaped bar top. It provided a “comfortable and practical surface for resting a coffee mug or working on a laptop.” The open design between the bar and peninsula created a seamless transition to the living space. The bar top was a natural spot for appetizers when entertaining, and “people seem to naturally congregate around it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cat and Jordan were most excited about the kitchen floor tiles. Cat wanted an abstract, black-and-white pattern. With their contractor&#8217;s help, they decided on a medley of Moroccan cement tiles in black, white, and gray hues. As Jordan explained, “The more traditional patterns reflected the age of the apartment and the black casement windows, while the mix of different patterns added an informal feel.&#8221; The same tile configuration sits in front of the fireplace tying the two rooms together.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26882 size-chrono" title="custom bookcases" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="custom bookcases" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<h3>The value of skim coating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the living room, their contractor designed a new fireplace mantel to complement the new built-in bookshelves. The clean lines provided a focal point. The walls were also skim coated and repainted. Initially, Jordan did not see the value in spending the time and money on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skim coating</a> (a texturing technique to hide construction tape and other imperfections to give walls a smooth and plaster-like appearance). However, they were so glad they did it. “I can’t believe what a difference it made—the whole place looks lighter, brighter, and fresher.” The parquet floors were stripped and refinished in a matte coating, preserving their original wood tones.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cat and Jordan&#8217;s biggest challenge was <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living through the construction</a>. It took longer than expected due to hold-ups with the cabinetry. They had to wash dishes in the bathroom and eat a lot of takeout. Wicket, their Norfolk Terrier, was curious about all the construction, so a baby gate was set up to keep her safe. “Wicket was pretty suspicious of the floor-sanding equipment, wood-cutting tools, and other supplies,&#8221; said Jordan. &#8220;Luckily, our contractors did a fantastic job consolidating the equipment in the construction zone and cleaning up at the end of each day, so we only had a few barking flip-outs.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26883 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-13-723x482.jpg" alt="custom bookcases" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, the couple has a bit of advice for future renovators. They say watch some home renovation shows to get design ideas. However, &#8220;prepare yourself for the possibility that something unexpected can happen during a renovation, especially in an old building.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While no budget-blowing issues came up, they did learn to take construction surprises in stride. “Having watched so many renovation TV shows, we felt relieved that nothing major popped up and were less disturbed by minor changes in the plans.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>She decided to renovate instead of move</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>With prices in her Fort Greene co-op building surging upward, film editor Mollie Goldstein faced a dilemma: she could cash out (but deal with the colossal hassle of moving) or remain in a building and neighborhood she loved (albeit in an outdated “starter” studio apartment). Some smart home equity math helped her see that the pros of her current place outweighed the cons, so she came to Sweeten to upgrade (inventively and colorfully!) rather than start again elsewhere.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39994 mb-0 size-full" title="blue kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="blue kitchen" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by Fort Greene homeowner Mollie Goldstein</em></p>
<p>About a year ago, I started noticing that prices for apartments in my Fort Greene co-op building had skyrocketed. I live in a studio, so the question of upgrading to a true one-bedroom was always on my mind. It had also been ten years since I bought my 500 square foot “starter apartment,” so I was starting to wonder if it might be time for a more “grown-up” dwelling. In short: Was now the time to cash out and buy something bigger elsewhere?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon consideration, though, I realized that 1) I love my building, 2) I love my neighborhood, and 3) my apartment is the exact right size for one person and one dog. The increasing market value, however, meant that I had equity I could borrow against, and so I decided to renovate the kitchen and bathroom and make myself a new apartment without having to uproot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39988 size-full" title="kitchen before renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39989 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom before renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04.jpg" alt="bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That decision turned out to be the easy part. When it came to planning a renovation—or even finding someone to help me plan a renovation—I had no idea what I was doing and no clue how to get started. After some time on the Internet, I thought a design/build firm might make the most sense for me, since I had no confidence in my ability to either design a proper space or supervise a contractor. But when I talked to the reps for several Manhattan firms, they laughed at my budget and sent me packing. Google eventually led me to Sweeten, where I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a>. The kind staff there double-checked my budget, but at least they didn’t laugh—and neither did the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a> I was eventually paired up with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She was amazing, and I felt an instant rapport with her. I’d had no experience in construction, but I do collaborate for a living (I’m a film editor), and I immediately recognized that she was a gem. The design process was so much fun. Because I was renovating in order to stay put, I wanted to design spaces purely for myself. Both rooms had always been serviceable, but the hasty repairs made before I moved in ten years earlier were showing their age, and I knew there had to be better ways to take advantage of the space I had available (especially in the surprisingly large-for-NYC kitchen). It drove me crazy that the kitchen cabinets didn&#8217;t reach the ceiling (so much wasted space!) and I hated stacking my spices on top of the stove. I also had a random hole in my kitchen wall where a neighbor&#8217;s contractor had drilled through and then disappeared. The bathroom was grungy in its off-white color scheme and constantly sprouting various leaks and cracks. I also love pattern and color, and I knew I wanted to create a personalized kitchen and something other than a standard white bathroom.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen design came together very quickly. I gave my contractor a few wallpaper swatches and a random list of priorities: I wanted a dishwasher, but it had to be less obtrusive than the current model; I needed a place for cookbooks; I was desperate for more storage; and could she please include a cute little spice drawer? Within a few days she sent me a rendering that was very similar to the final product. The Hygge &amp; West wallpaper (which I’d had my eye on for a while), set the tone for our color scheme and she designed a clever built-in with a hidden-drawer dishwasher by Fisher &amp; Paykel that I loved right away.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The basic layout of the bathroom was pretty easy, too, but we struggled a little more with the design. I knew I wanted something special, but I didn’t exactly know what it was. I sent my contractor a list of tiles I liked, none of which were appropriate, but she looked at them all and distilled the essence of what I was looking for, sending back the chevron marble from TileBar that we eventually went with around the tub (with its hexagon cousin for the floor). And as it happened, one of those other rejected bathroom tiles ended up as the kitchen floor — when we were looking at all our samples together, I slid that Bestile Moderna sample over to the kitchen pile, and, while neither of us had seen it coming, we both loved the black &amp; white pattern against the blue cabinetry. The floor has since become one of my absolute favorite things about the kitchen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to my contactor and her team, construction went pretty smoothly (for me). I moved out for five weeks while they dealt with all the problems of a crumbling kitchen ceiling, hauling debris out through a co-op lobby, and having to send back tile that arrived scratched. I’m sure there were a hundred other stumbling blocks that I never heard about, and I remain deeply grateful for the opportunity to work with trustworthy contractors whose standards were even higher than I expected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Maggie (my dog) and I have moved back in, I’m in love with my new space. Showering in my beautiful marble shower every morning is a treat, and I cook much more—and much more enjoyably—now that I have all the counter space I need. Both the kitchen and the bathroom are neater and less cluttered than ever before now that there is a place to put everything. I’m incredibly happy that I took the renovation plunge.</p>
