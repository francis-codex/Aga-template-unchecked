<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a toilet may not be the very first thing you think about when imagining your dream bathroom, it is definitely a decision that requires some thought. Ahead, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with general contractors outlines how to choose the best toilet for your bathroom renovation, highlighting sizes, styles, and features (including self-cleaning bowls). </span></p>
<h3>Determine the Toilet Size</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re replacing an existing toilet, you will need to find a model that matches the rough-in—the distance from the wall to the center of the flange, the bolts that secure it to the floor. Twelve inches are standard, but you can find 10- and 14-inch models. The next measurement to consider is height. While standard bowls provide a rim from 14 to 15 inches high, “comfort height” is also available, which sits 17 to 19 inches above the floor, to make getting on and off easier.</span></p>
<h3>Choose Your Style</h3>
<p><b>Bowl Shape<br />
</b>Consider the bowl shape: A round bowl is classic. It also takes up less space than an elongated version, so it’s good for a small bath or water closet. However, the elongated bowl provides greater room to sit and thus tends to be more comfortable.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you seek a contemporary style, look at toilets with a concealed or skirted trapway, to hides the contours of the base. Besides the sleek appearance, this version is easier to clean since there are fewer curves where dirt can collect.</span></p>
<h3>One-piece or two?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounds like a bathing suit, but there are practical as well as stylistic reasons. A one-piece toilet takes up less space, is faster to install, and easier to clean since there is no seam to trap grime. However, all other features being the same, a two-piece is cheaper, plus its tank can be removed if you need to replace it or repair a pipe, whereas damage to a one-piece can mean the entire toilet would have to be replaced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find wall models with the tank concealed in the wall which speeds maintenance since you don’t have to clean around the base. However, be aware that a wall-hung toilet requires breaking into the wall to hide the flushing mechanism which is an added cost to the budget. Also, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">access for repair is more complicated since the tank is not exposed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>

<h3>Fashion colors</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with appliances, you won’t find all styles in all colors, but you will find a nice range to choose from—including the hue of the moment, gray—if you want to go beyond white. A color will cost more, however, since whatever you choose won’t be manufactured in the same quantities as white or even black. And since white remains the most popular color for baths, you’ll enjoy plenty of options there, from cool to warm to ivory to bisque, to match your decor.</span></p>
<h3>Don’t Forget About Flush Performance</h3>
<p><b>Flushing mechanisms</b><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two choices: gravity feed and pressure-assisted: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as the term indicates, gravity feed uses gravity to send water through the rim of the toilet to force waste through the outlet pipe.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Pressure-assisted employs compressed air or a small pump. Gravity feed tends to be quieter, while pressure-assisted claims to require less water to operate along with greater effectiveness removing solid waste. You can find some pressure-assisted models that use electricity to boost function, but keep in mind if there is a power outage, the toilet won’t operate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Water conservation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two decades ago, the U.S. Department of Energy set a requirement for all newly manufactured toilets, restricting them to a maximum use of 1.6 gallons per flush. (Since then, the state of California has set a lower standard—1.28 gallons per flush.) Manufacturers met this requirement and, in fact, now some go as low as 0.9 gallons. As you shop, look for the WaterSense certification from the EPA, which indicates that the toilet uses no more than the standard 1.28 gallons.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr3uihyuiUo&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40927 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-OrderMaterials-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-OrderMaterials-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-OrderMaterials-1-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-OrderMaterials-1-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h2>
<h3>Other Toilet Features to Consider</h3>
<p><b>Dual-flush options</b><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You want worry-free performance from your toilet, but even with the EPA restrictions, you’re aware of the ongoing need to conserve water, right? With dual flush, just as the term indicates, two buttons offer either the option of a partial flush for liquid waste or a complete flush for solid.</span></p>
<p><b>Touchless flush</b><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Motion sensors are no longer just for faucets and towel dispensers in a public washroom. The same type of touchless technology can now activate the flushing of your toilet with just the wave of a hand. Super convenient and ideal for hygienic considerations.</span></p>
<p><b>Bidet or a combo?</b><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If a bath doesn’t have room to add a bidet—which takes up at least the width of another toilet—manufacturers now offer a toilet/bidet combo in some of their models. This added feature translates to as much as 10x the cost of a standard toilet, but think of all the money you’ll save on toilet paper. Expect to find controls that offer different settings for water temperature, spray, and pressure, and also a drying mechanism.</span></p>

<p><b>Self-cleaning bowl<br />
</b>While maintenance hasn’t been completely eliminated, some toilets come with ceramic glazes that include antimicrobial ions to reduce germs. You can also find models that integrate self-cleaning systems that do some of the scrubbing labor for you (and eliminate those messy toilet brushes!), with a combination of nozzles to reduce daily waste buildup, as well as a cleaning cycle, which is to say a system of sprays that— at the press of a button—interact with a cleaning solution emitted from a cartridge concealed in the tank.</p>
<p><b>And more little extras<br />
</b>It wasn’t so long ago that the news in toilets was the soft-close seat. Now you can have a toilet that opens the lid for you, too. Some turn the toilet into a miniature spa experience with more innovations, including soft LED lights for nighttime use, venting systems, and heated seats. If thes<span style="font-weight: 400;">e features don’t come with your new toilet, you can find kits at box stores to retrofit.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 5 remodeling projects prove that with a $15-20K budget, homeowners can get <em>a lot</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tiles are popping off the wall, the toilet makes a strange gurgling sound when it flushes, and stepping into the shower feels like entering a dark closet. If this situation sounds familiar, then your bathroom is ready for an upgrade. But what will it cost? A $15k-20k budget is an excellent range to cover all the basic bathroom renovation costs—materials, installation, and labor included—for a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toilet</a>, sink, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vanity</a>, fixtures, tile, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooring</a>, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lighting</a>. With that in mind, it’s also important to consider that the need for plumbing, electrical, or layout changes will likely add to the amount. <span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with general contractors showcases five of their bathroom remodels below as</span> good examples of what a $15K-20K budget will allow.</p>
<h3>$15k takes the blues away in a Brooklyn bathroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26277 size-chrono" title="$15k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09-723x964.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="964" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allison and Jovito&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon purchasing a 1910 brick row house, Allison and Jovito got to work on a serious renovation, starting with the upstairs bathroom. The bathroom hadn’t been touched since the 1950s and was very blue—blue tub, blue toilet, blue tile. With a budget of $15k to cover essential bathroom renovation costs, which limited them from expanding the footprint or moving plumbing, the goal was to focus on form and function. A new, dual-flush toilet, console sink, and clawfoot tub—all in white—replaced the original blue fixtures. The simple, classic look they achieved with marble flooring and white subway tile mesh well with the history of the house.</p>
<h3>Sleek fixtures and denim-like tile shine for $15K</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25194 size-chrono" title="$15k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01-723x1066.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1066" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario and Joe&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario and Joe’s main motivation for their apartment renovation was the bathroom. With a budget of $15k, they kicked off their remodel with a gray porcelain tile that had the look of coarse denim and installed it along the floor and vanity wall. The sink was swapped out for a streamlined <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA vanity</a> that was customized to fit a raised basin sink, and the existing mirrored medicine cabinet was replaced with a much larger one. A glass shower door, slim toilet, brushed nickel fixtures, and light above the vanity complete the transformation.</p>
<h3>For $17K, a Brooklyn couple raises the ceiling and gets double cabinet storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25122 size-chrono" title="$17k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000-723x1064.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1064" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-ellen-bens-brooklyn-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellen and Ben&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Kensington, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Budgeting $17k for the bathroom renovation costs, Ellen and Ben decided to focus on modernizing their master bath. To make it feel more open, the stand-up shower and dropped ceiling were removed and replaced with an open shower stall fitted with a glass door. The beige vanity was kicked to the curb and a wooden side table from West Elm, customized to fit a marble countertop and sink, took its place. Two medicine cabinets installed side by side provide ample storage. A new toilet and fixtures complete the functional upgrade, while black hexagon floor tile and floor-to-ceiling white subway tile fulfill the modern aesthetic.</p>
<h3>An architect&#8217;s $20K travel-inspired bathroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24180 size-chrono" title="$20k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-723x1084.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1084" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/an-architect-drafts-a-travel-inspired-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian and Erin&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An uninspired bathroom led Brian and Erin to a $20k remodel that would take their space on an international adventure. The remodel was prompted by outdated fixtures and finishes from the ‘80s and a leak in an upstairs bathroom that had ruined the ceiling. To create a unique space, Brian drew inspiration from the many hotel bathrooms he had seen while traveling for work as an architect. Floor-to-ceiling white subway tile was chosen as a simple backdrop, while blue penny tile was selected for the floor. Mirroring the blue tile, a luxurious clawfoot tub with a blue exterior took the look from standard to standout. The rest of the space was outfitted with a new toilet and bronze fixtures, an antique basin table and sink, and a custom red balau wood medicine cabinet.</p>
<h3>For $20K, everything had to go (except the tub and toilet!)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20616 size-chrono" title="$20k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="509" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-300x211.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celeste&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stained limestone tiling in her bathroom was the tipping point for Celeste, who, after a few unsuccessful attempts to remove the stains, budgeted $20k for bathroom renovation costs. Creating more <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> space became a priority, so a custom vanity with unique drawer configurations was installed. In order to decrease visual clutter, a dedicated spot within the vanity was designed to hold a small trash can. Celeste chose a marble tile with a cube effect for the floor and beveled subway tile for the walls. Although she decided to keep her original tub and toilet, she finished the look with additional new materials like the sink, countertop, and a new lighting fixture.</p>

<p>(<em>Above</em>) Kusum and Dave&#8217;s wall-mounted toilet in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovate-attic-pelham-westchester-new-topper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">converted attic remodel</a></p>
<h3>Why wall-mounted toilets are popular</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once prevalent in European commercial spaces, the sleek and smart design of wall-hung toilets continues to be popular in U.S. residential homes. Consider the benefits: the ease of cleaning with no more hard-to-reach spots, the gaining of valuable floor space, and more water-efficient options. For the latter, look for the Environmental Protection Agency’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WaterSense</a> label to find a low-flow model that uses 1.28 gallons per flush or less.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its minimalistic flair is a solution for awkward, tight spaces or that dream powder room with limited square footage. If a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-national-edition/">general bathroom remodel</a> is already in the works, an <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced general contractor</a> can assess if your space is suitable for this type of fixture.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44132 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ylia-HungToilet.jpg" alt="wall-hung toilet" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ylia-HungToilet.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ylia-HungToilet-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ylia-HungToilet-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ylia-HungToilet-1536x1024.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" />(<em>Above</em>) In <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/fixer-upper-washington-heights-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ylia + André&#8217;s</a> bathroom renovation, the wall-hung toilet added a clean new look.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Do you have room behind your walls?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most distinctive feature of a wall-hung toilet is that the water tank and plumbing hardware are concealed behind the wall, making the style ultra sleek. If you plan to switch from a conventional toilet to a wall-hung one, you will need to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Take down your wall</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Confirm there is enough room inside of it to accommodate the in-wall system and additional bracing</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Have your contractor modify the plumbing/waste system</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This upgrade can work well with a full bathroom renovation. However, it may fall into the more-trouble-than-it&#8217;s-worth category if the toilet is the only feature you&#8217;d like to change. In a full gut renovation, your contractor will have a better idea of the depth and/or contents of your wall after taking it down to the studs. Then it can be determined what special accommodations may be necessary, including:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Build out the wall an extra inch</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Work with your apartment building to adjust the plumbing</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Change the spacing between the studs</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Adjust the location of the toilet</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are other points to consider with a wall-hung toilet. Be flexible in your design to navigate unforeseen challenges. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Claud</a> installed a wall-hung toilet in a Brooklyn bathroom for a Sweeten client. “You won’t be able to install this type of toilet in many <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/">NYC condos and high-rises</a>. High-rises frequently have concrete slab subfloors and the board won&#8217;t allow you to break through them,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The toilet sits on a floor flange embedded in the concrete.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, owning a house allows you to alter the plumbing system. Claud said of a client&#8217;s house, “We had the luxury of breaking a hole through the bathroom floor and through to the basement ceiling.”</p>
<h3>Maintenance and repair of a wall-hung toilet (AKA &#8220;floating&#8221; toilets)</h3>
<p>Licensed professionals should be installing wall-hung toilets—and with great care. Since all hardware and plumbing are located behind the walls, future maintenance will require going back into the walls if any issues arise. Most wall-hung models include an easily removable flush plate that doubles as a maintenance entry point into the wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Tip: Keep a few extra wall tiles or a pint of your wall paint in storage just in case a necessary repair arises.)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Sold separately or together?</h3>
<p>A complete wall-hung toilet system includes the bowl, in-wall tank, carrier, and seat and can be purchased together. Pieces can also be sold separately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work closely with your general contractor to determine <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/">what you need to order</a>. As Claud explains, “I ask homeowners for the specs of their dream toilet. This means they download a specification sheet from the manufacturer’s website which explains all the details in order to install the toilet. The spec sheet shows me the plumbing connections and dimensions I need to know.”</p>
<h3>Experienced contractors should install a wall-hung toilet</h3>
<p>Your general contractor will guide you on ordering the right toilet model and all of the component pieces that will work best for your space.</p>
