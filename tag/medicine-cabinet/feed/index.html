<h3 class="p5">Living with a yesteryear Philadelphia bathroom</h3>
<p><i>Tiny pink south Philly row home bathroom needs a complete renovation,</i> our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> project post read. We attached photos, featuring not only the Pepto-toned tiles, but teal-colored rugs and seashell wallpaper. They’d been photographed three years earlier, but little had changed—proof that the project was way overdue. The bathroom hadn’t been renovated since the home was built in 1920.</p>
<p class="p6"><i><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11.jpg" alt="Portrait of Sweeten homeowners" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></i></p>
<p class="p6">We’re Kait and Patrick, former renters who jumped to buy a fixer-upper as we watched housing prices tick up in our ideal Philadelphia neighborhoods. When we purchased our 1,400-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-know-when-remodeling-a-philadelphia-rowhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">row house in the southern Point Breeze/Newbold</a> area a few years ago, we completed renovations including laying new floors, adding central air, skim-coating and painting the walls, and installing a new kitchen. But we didn’t have the budget to renovate the old bathroom.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Learning from past renovations</h3>
<p class="p6">As anyone can see, the bathroom was ugly. The floor tile didn’t coordinate with the walls. Everything was old and stained; no amount of cleaning made it look presentable. But it was our only bathroom (unless you count the creepy basement toilet and slop sink). When the time came to remodel it, our immediate priorities were practical: finding a contractor who could complete the project in a reasonable amount of time and without sacrificing the quality of materials or workmanship.</p>
<p class="p6"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before.jpg" alt="Split images of the bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52404" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p class="p6">Then there was the goal: To create something that would feel like a sanctuary. With that vision in mind, we put a lot of effort into interviewing contractors who responded to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/86002#before" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Sweeten project posting</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6178#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired our general contractor</a>. In our last renovation, honestly, we had terrible experiences. Like with the contractor who demolished our kitchen so prematurely that we lived without a kitchen for eight months. We were determined to prevent another debacle like that.</p>
<p class="p6">The bathroom was chaotic and we lived with it for a long time, but the chance to improve it came sooner than expected. After twice canceling our wedding due to Covid, we eloped and put the money saved towards the bathroom project. Our families and friends were generous with wedding gifts, further helping us fund the job.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p6">The small-spaced bathroom stays small</h3>
<p class="p6">From the first planning phases, we knew we would have no layout changes. We didn’t want to expand into any of the bedrooms, so we agreed that the bathroom would remain really small. We set out to use every inch.</p>
<p class="p6">Making the bathroom functional—versus crammed—meant we had to be intentional with the size of everything. The original bathtub was designed for shorter people, so finding one that could fit my 6’3” husband was a must, and we eventually did. We chose a trim toilet and a vanity that is narrow, but offers storage. We opted for a barn door-style glass shower enclosure to let the light flow through and open up the space.</p>
<p class="p6"><b><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08.jpg" alt="Vanity and mirror with bronze hardware" width="1000" height="1501" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></p>
<h3 class="p6">Choosing neutral with a pop</h3>
<p class="p6">We also achieved a visual openness with color, or lack of it. We used a lot of bold hues in the rest of our house; we wanted this to be a departure from that, so we went with gray and white. But with this neutral tile choice, we started to <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/how-to-splash-a-bath-with-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worry that the bathroom would be boring</a>—even if it did feel bigger, and calmer. We added the gold fixtures to give it a luxe feel. The pink paint is a sort of homage to the old bathroom.</p>
<h3 class="p6">The right renovation team</h3>
<p>Throughout the project, our Sweeten contractor gave honest recommendations and feedback. He was straightforward about what tile and fixtures would work best and be most durable. We received a lot of check-ins from Sweeten as the project progressed; it was helpful to know we had extra support if we needed it.</p>

<p class="p6">We love the result. The super deep soaking tub is amazing and was absolutely worth the money. I love that, unlike with the previous bathroom, I’m not aggravated by the decor when I walk in. Long overdue indeed. We’re so happy we made the most of nearly two tough years and turned this bathroom into a peaceful haven we both love.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Bathroom remodel “must-haves”</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Our home is a wood-frame row house in Jersey City, New Jersey. It’s 150 years old, has three floors, and 1,000 square feet. </span><span class="s1">When we first visited the house more than five years ago, I fell in love with the main bathroom’s vintage mint-green bathtub. I knew I wanted to preserve it. </span></p>

</div>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our home is historic, but over the years and through many renovations, most of its charm had been lost. T</span><span class="s2">he house’s two bathrooms are “newer”—added at some point onto the back of the house. The one we wanted to update is on the second floor, off of the primary bedroom. </span><span class="s1">It’s our only full bathroom. </span><span class="s3">We didn’t want to change the floor plan, but had a goal of</span><span class="s1"> modernizing while injecting a vintage feel. We planned to do this by</span><span class="s3"> keeping the original tub and adding a period medicine cabinet we’d found. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our second goal was to make the room warmer.

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Staying home during the remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">We embarked on the bathroom renovation last summer. Our household—two adults and two cats—had</span><span class="s1"> been working from home since the pandemic began in March 2020. My partner and I are handy and we’ve done many projects ourselves, including tile work, sheetrock, trim, carpentry, and minor plumbing and electrical work. We have a good sense of how things should be done, but we didn’t have the personal bandwidth <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/diy-vs-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to complete this project ourselves</a>. Luckily, the lockdown gave us the flexibility to have our only full bathroom out of commission. We would not have a shower during the bathroom renovation, but we had a backyard with a hose! </span><span class="s4">We would prioritize our bathtub and shower update, then move to the rest of the bathroom. </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Style sparks inspiration for the vintage bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> post, we mentioned the mint-green bathtub and our desire to work with it. We wanted the tub to feel intentional in the space, rather than something that was left there because it was too heavy or too expensive to get rid of. To make the room feel more “classic,” we wanted to introduce vintage elements, but merge them with a modern design. Posting our project on Sweeten made it possible for us to “take the plunge.” We were hesitant about hiring a contractor, but Sweeten gave us confidence, knowing we wouldn’t be going it alone.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Improving the bathroom layout</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">As planned, we did not change the bathroom layout, but some demolition discoveries influenced the project. </span><span class="s5">We found remnants of original pastel pink tiles near the tub—but while the color combination was classic in the bathroom’s era, we decided not to go so bold. With</span><span class="s1"> the walls down, we saw that we not only needed additional insulation behind the new sheetrock but in the ceiling as well. We also noticed that the ceiling near the door had been dropped by several feet. Pulling it down and replacing it offered an opportunity to open and visually enlarge the space. This nice surprise changed the whole feeling of the room.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Picking bathroom tiles</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finding modern tiles that seemed true to the historic nature of the house, but that would also play well with the tub, wasn’t easy. Matching tile to vintage mint-green porcelain is impossible, and coordinating colors—other than neutrals—are limited. We’d first selected a different floor tile, also with a green marble effect, but when we tried to order, it was no longer available. We’d already chosen a project start date so we scrambled to find a replacement. Fortunately, we found this mosaic polished stone tile. It was <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-much-does-it-cost-to-tile-a-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more expensive than our original pick</a>, which gave us pause, but we needed to move forward. I love how it complements the tub.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor used inspirational photos and sketched the design for the inlaid black pencil tile. He then executed it beautifully and it came out exactly as we’d hoped. The white wall tile has a vintage vibe but is simpler, allowing the tub and floor tile to shine.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Design ideas: old and new</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We chose this vanity in part because it was larger than our prior one, and has drawers. Our little old house is tight on storage, so it was important to maximize the vanity’s potential. I like the legs—it resembles furniture and lets the floor tiles show. We’d come across t</span><span class="s6">he </span><span class="s1">chrome medicine cabinet with lights at an antique shop and saved it until we were ready to start. Its curves are wonderful, as are the inner glass shelves, which are still intact. The mirror’s silvering has imperfections, but that adds to the charm.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My favorite aspects of the vintage (but still modern!) bathroom remodel are the high ceiling and floor tile. I had been planning the renovation for several years, and during that time I had collected probably 15 different floor- and wall-tile combinations. Ultimately, I was glad we took a few years to decide what we wanted and to find the right pieces. And I still love the green tub.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/64811-Sarah-Bath-06.jpg" alt="White toilet with art deco floor tiling" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52033" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/64811-Sarah-Bath-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/64811-Sarah-Bath-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/64811-Sarah-Bath-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Working with the right renovation partner</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From the very beginning, our Sweeten contractor responded to the issues and questions we raised and collaborated with us in the design process. He helped us plan out what materials we needed and told us when we would need them, helping us to avoid scrambles and delays. It never felt like our input was creating a problem, or that we were being ignored.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There was no avoiding the fact that we were living in a tiny construction zone but our contractor and his crew made it as painless as possible. It was great to see the time and effort they put into clean-up each day. We’re both extremely happy with the end result.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>In 2021, bathroom trends are breaking traditional rules about materials, style, and function</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48339 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-13.jpg" alt="Image of black and white geometric wallpaper in powder room" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-13.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-13-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-13-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />In 2020, we looked for a respite from the outside world. We needed to focus on self-care to help us navigate the stress of the pandemic. Enter the bathroom! It was a key spot to take time to ourselves, to relax with a glass of wine and a soak, or to nourish ourselves through daily beauty routines. Naturally, with a renewed focus on the bathroom comes the desire to renovate and refresh. Sweeten sees thousands of renovations a year, and in 2021, these bathroom trends are appearing in more and more homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>2021 bathroom trend: Doorless showers</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21435 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04.jpg" alt="Image of bathroom with walk-in shower " width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Walk right in! Homeowners are forgoing shower doors in their bathroom renovations. It&#8217;s all about the look and feel of the bath, and without a shower door to close off the space; bathrooms can appear larger and more luxurious. It can also help to make the space look fresh and contemporary. (One other upside: there&#8217;s also one less thing to clean!)</p>
<p>In the bathroom above, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovators Kate and Arthur </a>replaced the tub with a wet room—an open shower without curtains or doors—to keep the lines clean and open up the room.  Their Sweeten contractor included a wing wall to keep the water from splashing out. Other Sweeten renovators are following this trend too. Check out Sweeten homeowners, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/an-l-a-bath-remodel-reveals-wet-room-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liz and Kevin</a>, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brownstone-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giulia</a>, who designed their dream baths sans shower doors.</p>

<h3>2021 bathroom trend: Concrete bath counters</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34511 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06.jpg" alt="Image of bathroom with bathtub and concrete counters" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Traditionally, countertops in bathrooms have been ceramic, porcelain, or natural stone. Lately, there has been an uptick in the call for other materials, such as concrete. Concrete is seen as a major selling point as well as a way to modernize a space. It is durable and strong. You will need a fabricator and contractor to install it, however. And it is a bit more pricey than quartz or granite. But many think it&#8217;s worth it for industrial charm. Here, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovators</a> added it to their remodeling plans as a point of interest in their otherwise white bathroom.</p>

<h3>2021 bathroom trend: Whimsical wallpaper</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46962 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-13.jpg" alt="Image of black and white geometric wallpaper in powder room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-13-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Wallpaper is a great way to make a statement. It can be dramatic or subdued in color, texture, and pattern. Half-baths are the best candidates for wallpaper with a smaller footprint than a master bath. While many are concerned that steam would be an issue, there are <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wallpaper products made to resist</a> humidity.</p>
<p>Whichever type of bath you are looking to renovate, think about your design style and match it accordingly. These Sweeten renovators selected a black-and-white wallpaper for their powder room. &#8220;I wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all eyes to be on the geometric wallpaper,&#8221;</a> says homeowner Kirsty. &#8220;How could they not be?&#8221;</p>

<h3>2021 bathroom trend: Bold and black</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="gold-faucets-fixtures-in-white-bathroom" class="alignnone wp-image-48283 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-After.jpg" alt="bathroom with black walls and floating sink and toilet and gold faucets and fixtures after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-After-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-After-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Color is back and it&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">black!</a> Opposite to what many believe, using a black hue can actually make rooms look bigger because it allows the corners of the room to be undefined. And since they are not defined, it isn&#8217;t easy to tell where the walls start and end. In addition, black has a way of elevating a design. It is sophisticated and really matches any style decor—from contemporary to rustic.</p>
<p>For the bathroom above, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-bath-refresh-from-leaky-to-luxe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovator Veronica</a> decided to embrace the darkness of her space. “The bathroom got very little light to begin with, so I decided to embrace the cave-like atmosphere and go dark.”</p>

<h3>2021 bathroom trend: Medicine cabinet comeback</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brown-floating-vanity-black-floor-tiles" class="alignnone wp-image-44077 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-Richardson-blue-tile-bathroom-2.jpg" alt="brown floating vanity and large white sink in bathroom with clear glass shower door and black patterned floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-Richardson-blue-tile-bathroom-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-Richardson-blue-tile-bathroom-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-Richardson-blue-tile-bathroom-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Medicine cabinets used to be a thing of the past. However, today they are enjoying a newfound appreciation. In addition to many providing a mirror, they are great for storage. Homeowners choose them because mirrors are a necessity in the bath, so why not get some extra space for toiletries too? You can get one that is mounted on the wall like the <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/apartment-vs-house-a-brooklyn-family-decides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovator</a> did above. Or, you can have your contractor install an inset one so that the front is <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/88-year-old-master-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flush to the wall.</a></p>
<p>Remodeling a bathroom? Sweeten matches homeowners with pre-vetted, licensed general contractors.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Bathroom need color</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Owners Rachel and Michael didn’t want to go super modern with their bathroom update, so they went with a classic look that complemented their apartment’s prewar roots. The original space was dark and in an uninspiring neutral, the shower was cramped and confined by uneven walls, and old chipped tile throughout had clearly seen better days.  A remodel was in order. The couple posted their project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose their contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43078 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Creating more space without changing the layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping the existing layout intact, Rachel and Michael made crucial updates, starting with tearing down the unnecessary wall framing of the shower<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>which added an extra nine inches to the height of the shower<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>and swapping the old glass door for a new one. With a bigger and brighter space to fill, a waterfall of penny tile in various shades of blue shines as a showpiece. The open and light-filled shower with its mosaic of tile is now Michael’s favorite part of the bathroom.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43069 size-full" title="Blue and white bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1.jpg" alt="blue bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43072 mb-0 size-full" title="Console sink and medicine cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3.jpg" alt="console sink" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A contrast between colors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A dusky shade of blue paint dominates the upper half of the walls while balancing the crackle-finish white subway tile with the right amount of contrast. White hexagon floor tile adds another layer of pattern. The tub also experienced a major improvement: out went the old tub with a clunky, external drainage system, and in went the new with an integrated system, vintage-style wall-mount tub filler, and a tiled tub surround.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43077" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Same bathroom, bigger feel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a month of going back and forth on deciding on the replacement, the couple switched out the boxy, builder-grade vanity for an open console design, making the space feel considerably larger. A mirrored medicine cabinet and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">triple-light fixture over the vanity</a>—Rachel’s favorite details—complete the look. The result? A room once bathed in beige gets new energy. [For these homeowners, an open-console vanity was a must.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Dust bunnies averted! Michael noted that his contractor did a spectacular job of keeping the bathroom clean, combating the huge amount of debris generated by the work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 6 smart solutions for bathroom storage help decrease clutter and increase space</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even a small bathroom can be home to a large amount of storage space. The key is to get creative and use every nook and cranny you have to help store your essentials. Carefully plotting the layout and layering in key features like the Sweeten renovations below can help maximize space and minimize clutter—making a beautiful and functional bathroom.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>

Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor installed a recessed wall unit behind the door, creating almost-hidden additional storage.</p>

They considered (and used!) multiple bathroom storage solutions in the space. The designer recommended leaving the tub in its place and moving the toilet so they can fit a larger vanity. Plus, the six inches of space behind the shower wall allowed the couple to add double-storage niches.</p>

They wanted a hotel-inspired vibe that included more storage. So they had custom a shower niche put in as well as a large in-wall cabinet—perfect for hiding toiletries and other essentials.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Brighten up an old bathroom and make the space feel spa-like</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Kate and Jason thought they would eventually be priced out of the city until an apartment listing jumped out to them. It was a one-bedroom co-op in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. The couple and their dog, Baumer, moved in and immediately renovated the kitchen. “We took a couple of years to recoup before moving onto the bathroom,” said Kate. The bathroom was in rough shape. With no backsplash, the paint was peeling behind the cracked sink. The heat from a large steam pipe behind the wall rendered the medicine cabinet basically useless. “Hot toothpaste, anyone?” said Kate. The grout mosaic floor tile grout was impossible to clean. Kate described showering as a cramped, dark experience, the shower curtain blocking the room’s one source of light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: With both parties having design backgrounds (Kate in architecture and Jason in lighting design), the couple knew what they wanted. Kate ordered most of the materials to save money. Their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor</a>, who they found through Sweeten, a free service that pairs homeowners with vetted contractors, went the extra mile and picked up many of those materials. Despite lacking windows, Kate wanted to “achieve the look of a spa, make the room feel bigger; I also wanted the space to be easy to clean and maintain.” She mixed bright whites<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>including modern, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">square tile</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>with a warm wood <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> and cabinet. They are hung from the wall rather than mounted on the floor, making the room seem larger. The glass doors in lieu of a shower curtain added to that optical illusion. Kate used a bright blue clock with matching towels and a yellow hand towel to personalize the bathroom’s look. “They are all temporary accents that can be replaced when our tastes change or if we move,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: To reduce the budget, the couple <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stayed in the apartment</a> during the renovation. Friends who lived in the building let them shower in their apartment. “It did mean schlepping our shower basket downstairs and in the hallway, dorm-style,” said Kate.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: A makeover of an old hall bathroom on the Upper West Side</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Mary Ann and Frank dreamed of a new guest bath in the hallway since they bought their Upper West Side three-bedroom apartment in 1992. The space was almost all original from when the co-op was built in 1929. The original tiles and tub were long past their use-by date, but with kids still at home, the couple wanted to wait and renovate as empty-nesters. The master bathroom was also under renovation at the same time (a Sweeten project, as well!) and its tub was being removed. For resale purposes, there needed to be a tub in the guest bathroom, but the couple wanted to add a separate walk-in shower. That meant a possibility of losing precious <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>. Fortunately, their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> came up with some smart bathroom renovation ideas to maximize the layout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: To make room for a stand-alone shower, Mary Ann and Frank did away with an awkward bathroom closet. The couple was concerned the small space, about the size of a phone booth, wasn’t big enough. To help their decision, their Sweeten contractor taped the size of the shower—27” x 32”— onto the floor. Mary Ann spent a few minutes in the square to get a sense of the shower’s proposed size. “I really trusted our contractor,” she said, so the shower went ahead. To make up for the closet space now occupied by the shower, Mary Ann opted for a large <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> in the master bathroom which held most of the storage for both rooms. In the hall bathroom, the couple went for an old-fashioned sink without cabinet storage underneath. Its style was a nod to the old historic Upper West Side. Instead, built-in storage behind the mirror means beauty products have a place. Mary Ann purposefully picked a sink with a wide rim so there is space to put those daily toiletries when they are in use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: As the project came to an end, Mary Ann stumbled upon some <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tiles</a> she absolutely loved for the floor. They were white with black triangles. However, her Sweeten contractor was all ready to go with what she had originally chosen. “He let me change it at the last second,” she said. &#8220;I’m so glad because [the new tiles] make the whole bathroom pop.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Turn an old, run-down bathroom into something elegant and calming</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Mary Ann and Frank’s three-bedroom Upper West Side apartment had done its job since they had bought it in 1992.  But now, with their two kids grown and gone, the couple pulled the trigger on a long-planned master bathroom upgrade. “Our co-op building was built in 1929 and it was the bath from 1929<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></i>same tub, same tiles,” said Mary Ann, who works in publishing. Grime on the tiles wouldn’t budge and some tiles were no longer there at all. Paint peeled off the walls and with no vanity, shampoo bottles were always on prime display. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: To keep the costs down, the couple kept the original layout. But that was all they kept. What they wanted was a stylish sanctuary beginning with a hex tile bathroom. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hexagons were laid on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble</a> topped off the vanity for a refined look. The shower also has matching marble tiles. Their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> suggested painting, not tiling, the wall opposite the shower and vanity. Rather than feeling enclosed, the bathroom now feels “more like a room,” said Mary Ann, “and plus it would have been a lot of cleaning.” They did lose storage space in their master and hall bathroom, which they also renovated. However, a large vanity and two large mirrors with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> built into the wall that were added to the master bathroom made up for that. When you open each mirror, there is also another magnifying mirror. The vanity has six large drawers and two cabinets for storing toilet paper and cleaning supplies. &#8220;We were just going for a more calmer, less cluttered look,” said Mary Ann. “Now, everything is put away.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Mary Ann’s centerpiece is a walk-in shower so large “you can do yoga in it.” The old tub was decommissioned and replaced with a walk-in shower with glass walls. “It’s so much fun to take a shower now,” said Mary Ann.  </span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20746 " title="bathroom storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #76808f;">Laura and Matthew&#8217;s double drawer</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall-hung vanity</a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">With all the fixtures taking up space in the bathroom—sinks, toilet, plus tub or shower—it can be hard to also fit sufficient storage. The vanity alone is rarely enough. And if your space is traditional, with a pedestal sink, the need is greater. However, with smart planning that addresses all the tasks in the bath, you can find the best bathroom storage solutions.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a><span> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Planning your space</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">First, figure out where the fixtures will go. If you’re remodeling, you need to decide if everything stays put or if something moves. Evaluate the floor and wall space to find areas for storage—bathroom cabinets, shelves, or freestanding pieces like furniture. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Bathroom vanity</b></span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Once a simple box with doors and drawers for storing toiletries, the vanity has expanded its capabilities. Manufacturers like <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler</a> and <a href="https://www.duravit.us/html/default/home.us-en.html#/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duravit</a> have introduced built-in internal storage compartments that corral items small, medium and large, while still remaining in arm’s reach. Look for helpful add-ons like electrical outlets, adjustable shelves, and rollout trays. For existing vanities, small acrylic trays and storage boxes at the <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/welcome.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Container Store</a> fit a variety of drawer dimensions. If the bathroom is shared, and you have room for twin vanities instead of one large one, go for it! This allows each occupant to organize the space exactly as he or she wishes. </span><span class="s1">You can identify the type of vanity you want from among the following styles:</span></p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Floating &#8211; This style, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attached to the wall</a>, keeps the floor clear for an open look. You can find models from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.decoracabinets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decorá</a> that include at least one drawer unde</span><span class="s3">r the sink. Expect a small cutout in the middle of the top drawer to clear the plumbing pipes, and still allow room on the left and right. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Freestanding &#8211; The advantage here is the vanity can be moved, with little impact on the wall behind it. It typically goes countertop to floor so there’s more square footage for storage and more door-and-drawer combos. <a class="" href="https://ronbow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ronbow</a> makes vanities with integrated sinks and storage below starting as narrow as 19 inches wide, good to fit twin sets in a small bath. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-laura-and-peters-uptown-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Console styles</a> closely resemble furniture, with shapely legs below the cabinet to create an open effect, and usually incorporate a shelf near the bottom.<br />
<b><br />
</b></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Built-in cabinets</b></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This might be custom cabinetry, similar to what you would order for the kitchen, and from many of the same manufacturers. Or it might be <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bespoke</a>, crafted by a carpenter. Because the unit is built into a wall, it can be as large and long as you want. It also allows the addition of matching units above the counter, on either side of the sink, or between double sinks. You get lots of opportunities to vary door, drawer, and open shelf combos above and below the counter. <a href="https://www.kraftmaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KraftMaid</a> makes a narrow pullout unit with shelves, much like a pantry, to make use of a narrow vertical space. Consider upper cabinets with glass doors as bathroom storage for towels and pretty toiletries in a spa-like display.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Freestanding cabinets</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Similar to kitchen solutions, you can add a cabinet or an open case fitted with shelves in any free space in the bath. Make sure there is clearance for any activity taking place nearby. The advantage here is that the shelves can be adjusted when you wish—to hold a hamper or bath towels on a lower shelf, and smaller personal care items at arm level. Another alternative: a shelf that is not a shelf, such as an étagère—an open-back shelving unit—or one side of a ladder. These repurposed bathroom storage ideas can be found at resale shops or some furniture stores that make small decorative furniture for the bath.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Built-in shelves</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-and-after-ellens-kensington-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shelves</a> maximize <span class="s1">vertical space anywhere there is an open wall space with studs that provide support for attaching the units. Find a place for shelves adjacent to a sink, between sinks, or flanking sinks, above a toilet tank, high up around the perimeter of the ceiling, on a wall a foot or so from the shower, or even a shallow ledge above the vanity. In addition to shelves that match a manufacturer’s vanity collection, options include a wide selection of widths and depths or you can have a carpenter craft shelves to exact specifications. As with vanities, they come in a variety of </span>styles.</p>
<p class="p1">The most versatile, these shelves go anywhere there is sufficient support to attach them: above the toilet, between sinks or flanking sinks, high up around the perimeter of the ceiling, or even a shallow ledge above the vanity.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21983 size-chrono" title="bathroom storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Medicine cabinets</strong></span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Why go for a simple mirror when you can capture storage above the sink too? You have two options for storage here, with medicine cabinets that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recess into a wall</a> or mount on the wall, each with the traditional mirrored door that opens out.<br />
<b><br />
*</b>Recessed &#8211; Placed in the shallow wall space between studs, this style comes in versions from 4 to 8 inches deep—big enough to stow rolls of toilet paper. Kohler offers one for less than $100. <a href="https://www.robern.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robern</a> adds options with one, two, or three doors as well as electrical outlets for added organization and versatility.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>*</b>Wall mount &#8211; If you mount the cabinet on the surface of the wall, check out Decorá, which makes a model with storage shelves that slide out from either side, disappearing when not in use.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Built-in niche</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This type of shelf is located in a recessed area, such as between studs or even between two cabinets. Built-ins also work on a smaller scale in the shower, in the form of a niche for shampoos and soaps. In the wall above the tub, you can go larger and perhaps fit a couple shelves for a practical display of bath salts and liquid soaps. For visual interest, insert mirrored panels or beadboard on the back surfaces of the niches, or paint them a contrasting color.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Furniture</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">In addition to the small decorative pieces described above, it can be fun to introduce a vintage dresser or bookcase, if you have the room. Use the top to display personal items as well as toiletries. Drawers hold towels, small appliances like a hair dryer or electric razor. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Solve your bathroom storage with some of the suggestions described above, and begin to enjoy the serene space you deserve.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renovate an outdated</a> brown and beige bathroom</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Meredith and Jason knew when they bought their Chelsea home in 2015 that a bathroom renovation was in order. “Everything about it was old and ugly,” Meredith said. The plumbing was malfunctioning, the tub was worn, and the original designer hadn’t configured the layout to maximize the room. A bulky medicine cabinet and vanity gobbled up space. “The drawers would hit the radiator when you pulled them out,” Meredith remembers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: They turned to <span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with general contractors to implement a </span>few key elements in the design that really helped make a small space behave like a big one. The couple’s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> made a custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">medicine cabinet</a> that wrapped around some problem pipes behind the wall, enabling it to be recessed. A smaller <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/12-bathroom-sink-vanity-ideas-from-nyc-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> allowed the doors to open all the way, providing more functional storage space, while a new wall-hung <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilet</a> worked wonders: “You basically gained six to seven inches more by putting the tank into the wall,” Meredith said. The aesthetic needed to match the rest of the apartment, which was clean and current without being too modern. Against a bright background, the faucets and shower fixtures really popped with a black matte finish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The Sweeten contractor suggested some floor tiles that the couple say they would never have considered on their own. The result tied together the black matte of the fixtures and the rest of the bathroom’s design.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Clinton Hill renovation brings upgrades from the kitchen to a tough wood flooring decision</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">British expat Sam and her American husband, Sean, had been living in Park Slope for several years when they made the decision to find a place to buy. While they casually searched in Park Slope and its surrounding neighborhoods, they also prepared their finances and readied themselves for when it came time to make an offer. A fortuitous series of events led them to bid on—and win!—the first apartment they visited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten <span class="s1">shares</span> their (enviably easy) search and how they transformed a long-empty, rundown apartment into a beautiful home for a growing family.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23093 size-full" title="Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having heard horror stories from friends who suffered through multiple failed bids, Sam and Sean anticipated a difficult process. They imagined that they might also face rejection, so they jumped into the process with an offer after their first open house visit in the nearby Clinton Hill neighborhood.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">They realized that the space was old and hadn’t been lived in for quite some time, but were able to see past the grimy kitchen and bath, as well as the worn floors and peeling paint in this two-bedroom apartment in the famed Clinton Hill Co-ops (<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we’re big fans</a>, as you know). The large bedrooms were a big plus, while the generous common area could open up even further by removing walls separating the kitchen from the dining and living rooms. Otherwise, the size and layout were exactly right for their family of four, and they would remain within commuting distance to their daycare. The listed price also left room in their budget for the renovation the apartment so desperately needed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When the discussion came around to renovation at the Open House, the listing agent, <span style="color: #000000;">Tom Stuart</span> (who coincidentally also lived in the CHCs), mentioned that Sweeten would be an option for their project, given the ever-growing list of Sweeten alumni in the complex. So as they went into contract, Sam <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/10514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> and requested bids from contractors. A Sweeten contractor fit the bill, and they got to work updating the apartment after a slight delay in obtaining approval from the board and managing agent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To create a feeling of spaciousness, walls were knocked down to open sight lines between all of the common areas. (With two kids under five, this was especially important.) Sam wanted the kitchen to feel as large as possible by New York City standards, since the couple cooks frequently. The contractor closed off one of the openings between the hallway and the kitchen, so that a pantry and refrigerator could be installed in that space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the opposite side of the kitchen, in place of the old walls framing the dining area, a peninsula was installed for additional counter space and storage. The sink was moved out of a cramped corner, and placed alongside the dishwasher for ease of access. Sam chose to go with stock cabinets for the affordability factor. (Also, by this point, they learned that Sam was pregnant with their third child, meaning that this was unlikely to be their forever home!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When considering the palette, soothing neutrals provided a subtle backdrop to the inevitable and colorful chaos that always accompanies kids and their toys. In terms of storage, the full-length pantry was outfitted with pull-out drawers for maximum accessibility. Drawers were also installed in the peninsula instead of shelves. The kitchen design also included a Lazy Susan in the upper corner, so that hard-to-reach items in the back wouldn&#8217;t be a problem. Lastly, an integrated garbage bin kept the trash out of sight.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Deciding early on they did not want the hassle of obtaining plumbing permits, the couple left the fixtures in their original locations and instead focused on finding brighter, cleaner replacement options. They carried the same neutral look in the small bathroom, installing open shelving, a large mirror, and a metal-legged console sink to reduce the feeling of clutter. Behind the mirror is a spacious medicine cabinet for toiletries. And although a console sink meant no storage underneath—a brave choice for a family bathroom!—Sam reports that they’ve had no problems on that front, given the large hallway closet right outside the bath. For tile, a classic white subway tile on the walls and a subtly-patterned cement tile on the floor set a tranquil feel, while Pottery Barn lighting rounded out the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the rest of the apartment, the couple’s Sweeten contractor also refinished the floors and installed carpet over the hardwood in the bedrooms. Sam confides that it was Sean’s preference and she was initially unswayed, knowing it would be a controversial choice. But having lived with it now for a few months, they love the softness underfoot, especially for playing with their kids. (Plus, the wood remains intact and an option for restoration in the future.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the two closets in the master bedroom were combined into one, and the entire apartment was <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/skim-coating-in-5-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim-coated</a> and repainted. One thing that Sam wished they had done—and are now in the process of doing—was to paint and finish the undersides of the cabinets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23093 size-full" title="Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, the duo attempted to visit the work site regularly. In fact, this is her tip to future renovators: “Go to the apartment every week, at the very least. At first, we only visited on the weekends, when we had time. But the contractors weren’t working then. We realized that checking in at some point during working hours was a huge help, and that things went more smoothly when we did that, even though it was a pain. We could discuss issues as they came up, and see what they were talking about.” The renovation was completed within four months, allowing them to turn their attention to their next major project, a new baby!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Glossy IKEA cabinets, parquet floors, and smart material swaps led the way in this Prospect Heights renovation.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">First-time homeowners Jill and Aaron landed a sunlit co-op (with parking!) in Prospect Heights. The downside seemed daunting: a faux-wood-and-laminate-counter combo in the 1960s kitchen and thick gray tile throughout the small bathroom. With no idea where to start and trepidation about finding a contractor online, Jill came to Sweeten to hire a team who could re-think their galley kitchen and gut the old bathroom. Read on for Jill’s take on their bright new space!</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/glossy-ikea-cabinets-shine-in-a-brooklyn-kitchen-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19805" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/jill-kitchen-2.jpg" alt="ikea cabinets" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/jill-kitchen-2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/jill-kitchen-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Jill in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</span></i><span id="more-19767"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We lived in a brownstone garden apartment in Prospect Heights for six years before seriously looking to buy. Over six months, we spent every weekend checking out open houses and coming to terms with what we could actually afford (Move-in ready two-bed/two-bath in Park Slope? Keep dreaming!) After getting outbid on two apartments, the third time really was the charm. We were officially in contract for a one-bedroom in a doorman co-op building three blocks away from Prospect Park (and our current apartment). It had a space we could convert into a den, extra closet room, tons of natural light, and every New Yorker’s dream: parking! The only downside was that it hadn’t been updated since the ‘60s and needed a complete overhaul. Now what?!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19737 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="sweeten_jill_kitchen_bathroom-before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19738" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_jill_kitchen_bathroom-before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of our friends had done renovations so we didn’t have any recommendations to go on for a contractor. We reached out to a few random ones we found online, but we hadn’t seen any of their work and didn’t feel like we could really trust them. I was so nervous someone was going to take advantage of us since we hadn’t done this before.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s when a friend told us about </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we decided to </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1745" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We had never owned an apartment before, let alone renovated one, and we needed all the help we could get. After a quick budget check (the Sweeten team helped us realize we were completely unrealistic in how much the renovation would cost), we were matched up with </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Kris</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We loved that he had done work in our neighborhood, and it seemed to match our modern style. Plus all of his reviews said he finished his work on time, and since we would be paying rent on top of a mortgage until we could move in, that was music to our ears.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we met with Kris, he really listened to what we wanted to do and was quick to point out if something wouldn’t be possible. After walking the space with him, we agreed on a game plan: close off the wall between the galley kitchen and the dining room, open up the wall between the kitchen and living room, make a sliding door for the bathroom to maximize the space, extend the parquet floors into the kitchen and closets, and gut everything else! Almost as soon as we closed, his team was on-site and starting demo work.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since we knew this wasn’t our forever home, we tried to stick to a budget and not go too overboard. Kris helped us make all our decisions with the bottom-line and timeline in mind. New hardwood flooring would have been nice but the parquet flooring could just be refinished. Custom cabinets would have been gorgeous in the small kitchen, but the glossy IKEA cabinets we chose would still look great.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would have loved marble flooring in the bathroom, but ceramic tile wouldn’t need any maintenance. There were definitely areas where we splurged though: For one, Aaron got his wish for higher-end appliances and quartz countertops. My must-haves included an Italian glass backsplash and a new soaking tub.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19745 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="large format gray tiles" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19766" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-08.gif" alt="modern medicine cabinet" width="600" height="401" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were lucky our rental was close by, so we could stop in anytime and check on the progress. Kris was always there to meet us and show us how things were going and checked with us even if minor changes had been made. There were so many times we questioned whether we had made mistakes, but keeping in close contact with Kris and having him walk us through the progress really gave us hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, Kris was true to his word. We were able to move in after just six weeks and stay on budget. Now, when we hear some of our friends’ stories about their contractors and what a nightmare renovating was for them, we feel very fortunate and even talk about taking on a renovation again!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When advertising executives Lia and Chris Wollen made the leap to homeownership, they didn’t have to go far. A waterfront condo, just four blocks from their Williamsburg rental, called to them with bridge views and appealing amenities. After envisioning the possibility of a townhouse, square footage in the two-bedroom was a concern, but with a stunning kitchen and bathroom renovation, plus strategic spending and saving in a few key spots, Sweeten helped them make this home their own (with time to spare for the arrival of a new baby this winter!). Read on for Lia’s take on this beautiful project.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-56292 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="Sweeten homeowners in their space renovated with Sweeten" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
</span>Guest post by Williamsburg homeowner Lia Wollen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After three years of renting in Williamsburg, the time came to try and buy a place. My husband, Chris, and I hoped to find a spacious townhouse or something bigger than our current place. Planning for a family and wanting outdoor space, we felt that broadening our search to less trendy neighborhoods was our only option. After exploring most of Brooklyn, however, we found that we kept coming back to Williamsburg.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Six months into our search, standing just four blocks south of our rental and looking out at the East River from the roof deck of a two-bedroom on the market, Chris said, “Well, if we can do this, then I want this.” It was a top floor unit with a small terrace off the living room, high ceilings, tons of light, and views of the Domino Sugar Factory, the river, and Manhattan. It came with basement storage, a parking space, and a piece of the private roof deck. Square footage was a concern, and we agreed that we would have to do a renovation before moving in to accommodate long-term needs, but first, the offer. Ours was accepted.</p>
<p>I found Sweeten in a general contractor search online and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filled out the project post form</a> to be matched with general contractors. Not too long after that initial search, I saw a blog post like this one, of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another gorgeous Sweeten renovation</a>. One of the photos looked right out at the Domino Sugar Factory—a replica of our new view! I realized pretty quickly it was a condo from our building and emailed Sweeten to ask them for the contractor. They connected us with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>. We met with him to kick things off and were thrilled with the fit and his vision.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The focus of our renovation was the kitchen and bath. I love to cook and wanted a hard-working, welcoming space to gather in. The bathroom needed a feeling of calm, an escape from the city. Our contractor was strategic with us in his approach. He started big so that we could see the possibilities, and then collectively, we pulled each other back to set reasonable expectations. This process was critical when it came to prioritizing our wants and needs and managing the dollars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We underestimated the significance of overall design in renovating, but it was the beautiful and technical unifier underneath everything we were trying to accomplish. The contractor addressed the kitchen simply: hide the fridge, fill in the odd angles and edges of the ceiling, and provide more counter/storage space. This blew our minds. It cleaned up the whole space and looked like a kitchen that meant to be there, rather than an afterthought.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The most exciting proposal from our contractor was to open up the ceiling and expose building beams that were encased in the walls of the kitchen and living room. This eliminated awkward lines and revealed some industrial elements, playing off of the raw materials mirrored across the street at Domino. We achieved separation of living room and kitchen while retaining warmth in the space, by limiting how far we (and our budget) extended the look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another small but important detail was the flooring. The contractor and his team buffed out the overly lacquered yellow floors to get back down to raw wood, and we chose a sky gray matte stain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were other more indulgent decisions made during the planning process, like a wine fridge. This felt like a low-cost, high-impact amenity you don’t typically get in the city and we were very excited about it. Chris insisted from day one that we have a garbage disposal, so that was non-negotiable. We also debated and ultimately agreed to a waterfall edge for the kitchen countertops. Our contractor had strongly recommended this as a focal point when entering the home, and he was absolutely right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-56288 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Candid shot of Lia in her kitchen renovated with Sweeten" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56292 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="Sweeten homeowners in their space renovated with Sweeten" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the bath, we kept the tub, sink, and hardware, but had everything retiled. We used leftover marble from the kitchen for the tub and installed a glass shower partition to open up the small space. We also built a new medicine cabinet and drawer for the sink to accommodate storage, and I found some new light fixtures to modern it up a bit.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris and I have a very similar aesthetic, so choosing materials, appliances, and fixtures was pretty straightforward. Before construction, I spent a lot of time pulling looks and materials from home and design websites, so we had a strong point of view right away. My must-have was a Wolf Range with the iconic red knobs. Snobby, kinda, but an important design element in an otherwise minimalist kitchen. The thing is also a weapon! (Chris started a grease fire the first time we used it.) Keeping in line with the stainless steel, we also bought a new Bosch dishwasher.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Material choices included Carrara marble, beveled and plain white subway tile with dark grout, classic New York hex tile in the bath, Edison bulbs, and glossy white cabinets. We chose IKEA cabinets because of another Sweeten renovation I caught on Instagram. It was very important to me that the cabinets went as high as they could go. I wanted an excess of clean-looking storage space and was not interested in dusting open shelving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56287 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowners in their renovated kitchen" width="1000" height="1494" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01-600x896.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were easy-going clients who trusted our contractor and his vision. We made things easier by not changing our minds and being open to his direction when we were undecided on something. The biggest decision, which we labored over the longest, was whether or not the kitchen should remain galley-style. The choice is obvious now, but there was something tempting at the time about toeing that suburban-house line with a big island to gather around. After the renovation, any concerns with square footage more or less went away. More, because we made so much out of what existed, and less because in March we found out we are expecting a baby boy this month!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re back in Brooklyn for round two of Chris and Amber’s home renovation! Last week, Chris shared a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/chris-and-ambers-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">detailed account of their lovely kitchen renovation</a>, and this week we’re lucky enough to get another tour featuring two vitally important areas of their Ditmas Park home. Read on for a new take on how they made way for a second bedroom and squeezed in a full bathroom renovation, all just in time to welcome a new baby!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/chris-ambers-bathroom-kids-room-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17257" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/amber-bathroom.jpg" alt="ditmas park bathroom renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/amber-bathroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/amber-bathroom-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
Guest post by Chris, Ditmas Park homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During construction, many people, not least of all our immediate neighbors, asked us why we were renovating our apartment. In the earliest stages, we would say, semi-seriously, that all we had really intended to do before things got out of control was put in a dishwasher. We had quickly realized that re-doing our kitchen was going to be an all or nothing endeavor for us and putting in a dishwasher somehow became ripping our kitchen down to bare studs. But once we found out that our second kid was on the way, the focus of the project became carving out a room for our older son that was just big enough to be useful, but small enough to keep the kitchen a reasonable size. After <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting our project on Sweeten</a> and meeting <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these Sweeten general contractors</a>, we went full steam ahead with their innovative design for our kitchen and new kids&#8217; room.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17271 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17258" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten general contractors understood that we needed to be able to fit a standard-sized crib along one of the crved walls, and that if push came to shove we could alternatively squeeze in a standard twin bed running the other way, just in case we end up staying in the apartment for quite a while longer than we’ve planned. We kept the curved walls of the room as they were since it is a nice pre-war touch that conveys the fact that the room juts out into the facade of the building, forming a miniature bay window with a tiny balcony for plants. We laid a new wood floor and installed a heavy door that swings open to be flush against the wall outside the room, almost making it disappear when it’s open. The other thing that makes it feel so much bigger is that there is a full transom milk glass window along the top of the doorway. It brings light into the kitchen and keeps the partition between the kitchen and our son’s room from dominating.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We only finished the last details of our son’s room a couple months ago: a series of picture shelves from Pottery Barn that we painted to match the walls, a roller blind, and a cheap but cheerful rug from Land of Nod. Honestly, it was knowing that Sweeten was sending a photographer that made us pull it all together!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Halfway through renovating the kitchen, we realized that if we didn’t do the bathroom, it was never going to happen. Our apartment and our lives had already been turned upside down and we knew we were never going to go through it again. The former bathroom had tiling that ran up the sides of the walls which created a tub effect and everything felt very tired and shabby.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We installed large dark gray tiles, replaced the old tub with a Kohler cast iron model, and redid the shower stall which is separate from the bath in clean simple narrow subway tiles from Nemo. The sink and vanity are from IKEA. We raised the ceiling of the stall and installed a ceiling light which makes all the difference. All the fixtures are Grohe, good bang for the buck and they toe the line between modern and classic.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Every project ends with a few things that you never quite get to and our wall light in the bathroom is one of them. We kept it in the original spot which is centered on the wall but not over the medicine cabinet. Our contractor was happy to move it but in our hurry to move back in with a two-week-old baby we figured we could live with it. Even now, every time I flip on the light I think of how amazing it felt to be back in the apartment after the work was done, so, I am happy to leave it where it is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Karen and Kevin bought their Upper West Side co-op, they knew there was work to be done. To make the one-bedroom and one-bathroom ready for their family, they hoped to convert a small dining room nook into a nursery for their adorable daughter, Eleanor. Karen, an accountant in the hotel industry, and Kevin, a product manager at a software company, planned to do all renovations before moving in. Approvals took time, and the quest for a contractor stalled as some candidates balked at carving out the nursery space they envisioned. After interviewing several potential teams, Karen <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her apartment renovation project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and met their Sweeten general contractor, who didn’t bat an eye. “He really genuinely understood what we wanted and thought he could do it,” Karen said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/karen-and-kevins-apartment-renovation-sweeten-upper-west-side/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15499 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg" alt="karen's apartment renovation sweeten " width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen’s laminate counters and veneered cabinets were high on the list of issues, and the couple decided to tackle major bathroom grime as part of the overhaul. Karen and Kevin worked with their contractor to design a pocket door for the nursery, prepared to rehab an old windowsill, and planned to freshen up with new paint in a few spots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15500" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Karen's Kitchen Sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s team re-oriented the kitchen and removed a service door leftover from an earlier era. The new layout brought the opportunity to eke out more storage in every possible place—which meant custom cutting larger IKEA cabinets to fit the space. “We really wanted to max every inch we possibly could,” Karen said. But those extra inches came at a cost: time. “Custom cutting all of the cabinets was something we didn’t factor into the timeline.” Since the couple was commuting to see progress from where they were living in Red Hook, things often seemed slow, but the expanded storage turned out to be worth the wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep the sleek white lacquered cabinets from feeling too space age, Karen and Kevin picked a warm mosaic stone backsplash and a granite countertop from Brooklyn Granite. To keep costs down, Karen tried to snag as many of her Bosch appliances from out-of-state as possible to minimize sales tax. They installed undermount lighting and Karen’s favorite feature: a built-in filtering faucet that makes loading up a fridge filter a thing of the past.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom came with an extra long tub that was extra bulky and extra annoying. By removing the enormous 66-inch tub and replacing it with a standard-sized soaker, they made space for a larger, airy vanity with a drawer and storage underneath. “We picked the wood vanity to give it some warmth and more of a masculine feel,” Karen said. Karen was adamant about a recessed medicine cabinet with interior outlets, so gangly appliances like electric toothbrushes stayed out of site. The white subway tile also features it’s own storage niches in sleek black.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To continue the rustic-meets-minimalist vibe, the couple preserved the unfinished wood door, an original feature. After removing about “twenty layers of paint,” the door now opens and closes easily and the original crystal knob pops against the austere backdrop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15503 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15501 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15502" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Karen’s advice to fellow renovators stems from the botched delivery of three different toilets. Since the couple wasn’t living in the apartment during the renovation, there was a lapse before each mistake was discovered. “Our contractor warned me about this, make sure you order all the supplies and the contractor has them there right away so no one is waiting for things to arrive.” Karen and Kevin learned to allow and check for items to be on back-order or get delayed and to check deliveries as quickly as possible for accuracy and completeness.</p>
