<h3>A couple&#8217;s journey to the ideal railroad-style apartment</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For every homeowner, there are certain household features that just aren’t negotiable: from space layout to square footage and modern features. Some owners are willing to do whatever it takes to make sure their home matches their preferences, which was certainly true for Lavanya and Regis, a couple who had to try (and try again) before finding a space that truly felt like home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They had sold an apartment that she had loved, and proceeded to buy and move into another that they both really disliked. Lavanya, the executive producer for Artifex Productions, a New York City-based production company, decided to give it another try, saying, “We were on the hunt for something like the old place.” </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="lavanya-with-her-dog" class="alignnone wp-image-57478 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-portrait-1.webp" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowner" width="600" height="900" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-portrait-1.webp 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-portrait-1-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The renewed search was for a railroad-style layout with distinct spaces that could serve different purposes for home and business activities. When she and her partner Regis, who manages an NYC-based restaurant, and Frankie, their 11-year-old Jack Russell terrier, saw it, they knew it was the one. They snapped up the railroad apartment and <span class="s2">posted their project</span> to find<span class="s2"> a <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor </span>to help them implement their vision for their unusually shaped home.<i> </i></span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-dining-12.webp" alt="Living and home office space with white floors" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-57472 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-dining-12.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-dining-12-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-dining-12-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-8.webp" alt="White kitchen with white floors" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone wp-image-57476 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-8.webp 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-8-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The railroad apartment, a long-skinny layout, was introduced in New York City in the mid-19th century. The style, also referred to as a “floor-through,” is known for its small, narrow rooms. However, with some help, a railroad apartment can become the perfect layout for a couple with at least one work-at-homer. Lavanya knew from the first apartment she and her husband had that a long, rambling railroad-style flat could be configured to create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-bronx-rowhouse-remodel-for-work-life-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private office for her to work in</a> without feeling like the rest of their home life was overlapping with her space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They found their new apartment in South Park Slope, Brooklyn. The two-bedroom condo was 700 square feet and, as is typical, stretched from the front of the prewar building, built around 1910, to its rear. One thing railroad-style apartments are known for is the immodest “bathtub in the kitchen.” While there was no tub in theirs, the overall layout still didn’t fit the couple’s day-to-day needs, and would still plan to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revamp their apartment&#8217;s flow</a>.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-6.webp" alt="White and wood kitchen" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone wp-image-57474 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-6.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-6-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-6-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="s1"></span></p>
<h3>Planning a railroad apartment renovation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Lavanya and Regis signed their Sweeten contractor, they understood that they would need a six-month renovation to cover work across multiple rooms. To begin with, the railroad-style condo was strangely configured: the primary bedroom was at the apartment’s back end, far from the bathroom, and next to it was the dining area, which, as the former owners had it arranged, was separated from the living area by the kitchen. To the couple, the apartment’s arrangement felt backward. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">To help the couple, their contractor recommended Jennifer Levy of <a href="https://www.cavdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAVdesign Interiors</a> to make sense of the space they were working with and create the right flow that would work for them. </span><span class="s1">The team decided to <span class="s2">flip the layout</span> so that the area that had been the living room would become their bedroom. The rear bedroom, which was large, would become a living area and office. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bedroom-11.webp" alt="Bedroom after the renovation" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone wp-image-57468 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bedroom-11.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bedroom-11-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bedroom-11-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="s1">[P]ocket and barn doors&#8230;saved a ton of space and made our whole home feel modern and cool.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We needed to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fix the kitchen</a> which had issues including old, honey-colored wood cabinets and a layout that was far from its efficient capacity. The floors throughout the apartment were uneven and stained a reddish color which felt outdated. Their goal was to make the main rooms bright and airy by integrating glossy white-painted wood floors, built-in storage, and recessed lighting on dimmers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next up was <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redesigning the bathroom</a>. The tub had been shoved into a corner and closed off by an unattractive partial wall, creating a very narrow and dark opening. The toilet and sink were installed too close together and the bathroom had minimal storage. Ultimately, the duo wanted to reconfigure the room to create a more spacious, spa-like environment. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57466 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bathroom-9.webp" alt="Bathroom remodel with wooden cabinets" width="600" height="900" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bathroom-9.webp 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bathroom-9-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3>Kicking off the work with a Sweeten expert</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their Sweeten contractor installed solid oak wood floors and painted the planks with high-performance floor paint. They ran into challenges while updating the lighting when the electricians realized that installing the dimmable lighting would require replacing the wiring to bring it to code. This ended up creating many new holes in the walls, which then needed to be patched and skim coated putting the project behind schedule. One bright consolation was the brand-new dimmer switches—one of their favorite features.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen was a success</a> without many problems to solve. The contractor suggested hiding the refrigerator, freezer, and dishwasher behind panels that matched the cabinetry. The room was spacious enough that their new <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">washer and dryer</span></a> found their place behind a closet without conflict. The finishing touches included handmade tiles for the backsplash and a custom butcher-block counter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-closet-2.webp" alt="The entryway to the apartment" width="601" height="900" class="alignnone wp-image-57470 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-closet-2.webp 601w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-closet-2-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lavanya was especially excited about the closets custom-designed for the bedrooms, with sliding shoe racks to accommodate her self-professed “footwear addiction.” That organizational theme continued on many of the interior thresholds with pocket and barn doors; this idea, which their contractor embraced, saved significant space and made their whole home feel modern and stylish.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom planning process</a> was a collaboration between Lavanya and Regis who enjoyed both the creativity and end result. They opted for a hand-poured concrete floor and custom cabinets, along with luxurious hand-made tiles for the shower and a deep, cast-iron soaking bathtub (a non-negotiable for the couple.) New shower fixtures, including a rain showerhead, a towel heater, and a dimmable backlit mirror pulled it all together. </span></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-sliding_door-3.webp" alt="Roller top barn door" width="601" height="900" class="alignnone wp-image-57479 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-sliding_door-3.webp 601w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-sliding_door-3-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" />An in-sync partnership produces great results</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every step of the way, their Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor was fantastic</a>: “Relaxed and professional from the outset, he <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped me stay calm</a>, even when delays and surprise expenses came up. The electricians and plumbers were exceptional as well,” said Lavanya. During the renovation, their contractor came up with ideas to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep costs at the right place</a> and also substituted some expensive ideas with affordable ones.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We love our gleaming floors and the brightness of the rooms, and our beautiful, modern bathroom. It’s like we live in a white palace!” Lavanya shared. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you, Lavanya and Regis, for sharing your space with us!</i></span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Refresh a kitchen in Jersey City, NJ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Kate and Matt loved their Jersey City neighborhood with the park across the street from their 1870s building. Nevertheless, after seven years of marriage, they knew what did and didn’t work in their kitchen floor plan, and decided it was high time for a makeover. Cheap ‘80s-era cabinets were showing their age, and storage was bursting at the seams, creating a chaotic pileup on every surface. While the kitchen is indisputably the heart of the home, when it literally falls in the middle of a living space (often referred to as railroad-style), it takes some serious planning to make the space fully functional.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cook space was serviceable but worn. Kate had lived in the condo since 2000 and was more than weary of the laminate-clad cabinets and counters and the 30-year-old appliances. The kitchen’s location, in the middle of the apartment, dictated the galley setup. A massive soffit further encroached on the wall space, limiting storage.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Kate’s primary objective, besides a completely new look, was the addition of a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-peninsula-ideas-for-small-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breakfast bar</a>. “I spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking,” she said, “so I really craved a little spot in which to sit.” She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19777" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3189" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose her Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30959 mb-0 size-chrono" title="glossy-wooden-flooring-passageway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen02-723x1085.jpg" alt="glossy wooden flooring in passageway with white railing and gray custom shelves after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen02-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen02-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kate knew she wanted gray cabinets but worried the kitchen, which had no windows, might still be dark. So she countered with lighter materials for all the other surfaces—white quartz countertops, a white subway tile backsplash, and a pale wood breakfast bar. Her budget didn’t include money for new light fixtures, so she found brighter LED bulbs for the recessed ceiling lights. “That made a big difference.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her contractor saw an opportunity to move the refrigerator a few feet over from its original corner location, to allow storage on either side, while breaking up the monotony of a long run of cabinets. In addition, he moved the placement of the new dishwasher (an 18-inch version that Kate scored from Craigslist) from the left of the sink to the right, permitting roomier, deeper drawers to the right of the range, where they were needed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As for Kate’s breakfast bar, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley layout</a> proved less of an obstacle than she thought. After discussing several scenarios, she and her Sweeten contractor settled on a location at the far end of the kitchen, above the stairs. Matt and Kate wondered about things falling off the ledge to the floor below, particularly from the swipe of a paw from their tabby, George. A raised back to the bar was added at her contractor’s recommendation to inhibit the antics of a capricious cat. He also inserted a diagonal base cabinet between the range and the cabinet abutting the breakfast bar. “I worried I’d be constantly bumping into sharp corners,” said Kate, “but the diagonal unit made everything flow together.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30968 size-chrono" title="white-countertop-kitchen-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During03-723x1085.jpg" alt="white countertop and kitchen cabinets with brown vinyl floor during renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During03-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During03-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30964 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-custom-cabinets-open-shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen07-723x1085.jpg" alt="blue custom cabinets on wall with open shelves and white countertop with steel sink and faucet and glossy wooden floor after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen07-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another concern was whether her budget was enough for everything she wanted. Her contractor advised her on which materials to choose so she wouldn&#8217;t overspend. Now, with plenty of cabinets to store cooking gear, and loads of counter space, there’s a place for everything and everyone, including George, who also likes to sit at the breakfast bar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: When the time came to gut the kitchen, her Sweeten general contractor made a marvelous discovery. The soffits, which consumed so much upper wall space, were empty. This meant they could be removed, and taller upper cabinets installed, greatly increasing <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage capacity</a>. “It just opened up the room,” said Kate. “It feels more spacious and brighter at the same time.”</p>
