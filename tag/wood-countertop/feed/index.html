			<h2>From granite to quartz, different types of kitchen countertops can deliver on both looks and performance</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41793 mb-0 size-full" title="Caesarstone countertop in Statuario Maximus" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Image of granite countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>Updated on October 14, 2021</em></span></span></p>
<p>After <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen cabinets</a>, kitchen countertops have the most style impact in the kitchen. There are many types of kitchen countertops to choose from—stone, quartz, solid surfacing, wood, to identify the most popular—so you’ll want to take a few factors into consideration before pulling out your wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where will it go? Will it be attractive if it’s visible from adjoining living areas as well as the cooking space?</li>
<li>How will you use it and how often? Can it stand up to common spills and daily impact with cooking tools?</li>
<li>What other features will it connect to? Will it look good and stand up to adjoining elements, like a sink or a stovetop?</li>
<li>How often do you clean? Besides the after-meal swipe with a sponge, are you up for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ways-care-renovated-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taking the time for regular maintenance</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Happily, whatever your answers are to the questions above, there is a countertop for you. Today’s eclectic kitchen styles also welcome a mix of materials, so don’t worry about everything matching. You can have one material for the island and another for the countertop, or treat yourself to a small slab of marble for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar space</a>, for instance. For best results, always hire a professional certified to fabricate and install the particular material you choose.</p>
<p>Below are popular kitchen countertops that Sweeten homeowners have installed, along with the pros and cons of each material.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Marble kitchen countertops</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25997 mb-10 size-full" title="Carrera marble countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="Image of marble kitchen countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Carrara marble kitchen countertops in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lia and Chris’ kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Sought for its classic beauty and variety, marble still draws its fans among homeowners who want to have stone in the kitchen. However, it is more porous than granite, and this factor—combined with a high price tag—limits its application to a few areas of the kitchen, like entertaining or baking areas. Remember that this particular material enjoyed pride-of-place in grand homes in the last two centuries, so if you are up for classic elegance that yields a timeworn patina, this could be the stone for you.</p>
<h4>Cost of <strong>marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at more than $100 per square foot (which does not include fabrication)</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Pros of marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Withstands high heat</li>
<li>Adds a high-quality, luxury look suitable for traditional or contemporary kitchens</li>
<li>Stays cool, so good for rolling out dough</li>
<li>Pairs beautifully with many other surfaces, especially wood and metal</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Cons of marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The most expensive of stones</li>
<li>Limited in color choices—whites, grays, blacks</li>
<li>Stains, scratches, cracks, and chips more easily than other stones</li>
<li>Requires monthly sealing and may still discolor</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soapstone countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43650 mb-10 size-full" title="Blue/green soapstone countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15.jpg" alt="Image of soapstone countertop and backsplash" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Soapstone countertops in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janet and Jerry&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Soapstone’s resistance to heat and water, along with a muted color palette marked by subtle veining, makes it an appealing alternative to granite and marble. It also comes with a slightly lower price tag, which is attractive to budget-conscious homeowners. However, soapstone countertops do require care, like all stones.</p>
<h4>Cost of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $70-$100 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resists heat and water</li>
<li>Color tends to be uniform throughout the slab</li>
<li>Suitable for sinks, too, if you want a blended look</li>
<li>Comes in at the lower price spectrum of natural stone</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scratches easily and will show stains, which can be sanded out</li>
<li>May crack or chip if you aren’t careful when working on it</li>
<li>Requires regular sealing and will show stains if not wiped up immediately</li>
<li>Develops a patina over time, which you may or may not like</li>
</ul>
<h3>Engineered stone countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45708 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14.jpg" alt="Image of townhouse kitchen with engineered stone counters" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Engineered quartz countertops by Caesarstone in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellamy and Zak&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Of all the types of kitchen countertops, engineered stone is probably the toughest surface on the market. This material is typically 90 percent quartz mixed with pigments and polyester resin, then manufactured under pressure into highly dense slabs. Manufacturers such as Caesarstone offer a vast array of looks, including many faux granites as well as the whitest whites, blackest blacks, and some brilliant colors like red and blue. Claims that it won’t stain or fade or succumb to high heat make them <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;popular kitchen countertops&quot;}">popular kitchen countertops</span>, edging out granite, despite the fact that the cost is roughly the same or higher than natural stone.</p>
<h4>Cost of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $100 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most impervious of all surfaces; resists heat, stains, scratches, bacteria, fading</li>
<li>Huge selection of patterns and colors, including faux stones and custom colors</li>
<li>Can be manufactured into nearly any shape you want</li>
<li>Requires no sealing or special maintenance</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Faux stone doesn’t appear to look like real stone</li>
<li>May crack on sudden impact with a heavy object</li>
<li>Costs as much as real stone</li>
<li>Solid-colored slabs will show seams</li>
</ul>
<h3>Granite countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41793 mb-10 size-full" title="honed black granite countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Image of granite countertops in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above) Granite countertops in </em><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/kitchen-renovation-east-hampton-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ann&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Granite landed on the kitchen scene a little over two decades ago and remains popular. It’s a close second behind the number one choice, engineered stone, according to a survey from the National Kitchen and Bath Association. Why do granite countertops endure? Simply put, they combine unique beauty with durability and low maintenance. The natural grain means no two slabs will be identical. While very hard and impervious to heat, granite is porous, so it needs to be sealed at least annually—easy enough with hand application by sponge.</p>
<h4>Cost of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts around $60-$100 per foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resists high heat</li>
<li>Comes in a range of colors and grains</li>
<li>Each slab has a unique appearance</li>
<li>Maintains its value if well cared for, including sealing annually</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Expensive, but popular colors come in lower prices</li>
<li>Shows wear from knives and spills like vinegar, citrus juice, and oils, so use a cutting board on top</li>
<li>Requires regular maintenance, which a DIY project with a sealant and a sponge can accomplish</li>
<li>Will crack if improperly installed or a heavy object makes an impact</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solid surface countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49495 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen with black and white floor" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/an-architect-guided-art-deco-renovation-for-a-queens-townhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Architects Can Vu Bui, Lane Rick, and Matthew Storrie&#8217;s kitchen remodel </a></span></p>
<p>Twenty years ago, solid surfacing was the darling in the world of kitchen countertops. It still deserves consideration, as many qualities have been improved over time by brands like <a href="https://www.corian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corian</a>. It is heat- and stain-resistant and comes in a range of looks, including faux stone, and lots of fashion colors. Because it has a little give, due to it being made of acrylic or polyester or a blend of the two, objects dropped on solid surface counters are less likely to break. It also can be molded into many shapes, including intricate inlays, edge and backsplash treatments, as well as furniture.</p>
<h4>Cost of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>$80 to $100 per square foot, depending on the pattern and color</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Heat- moisture-, and fade-resistant</li>
<li>Enormous choice of colors and patterns, including custom</li>
<li>Seams fuse together so joints don’t show</li>
<li>Molds into just about any shape including integrated backsplash or sink</li>
<li>Does not require sealing; clean with mild detergent</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can’t take high heat; will lose shape</li>
<li>Vulnerable to scratches, cuts, and prolonged exposure to stains like wine or catsup; requires a cutting board</li>
<li>Faux stone looks don’t exactly resemble stone</li>
<li>Not recyclable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wood countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44120 mb-10 size-full" title="walnut wood countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13.jpeg" alt="Image of kitchen with wooden butcher block countertop" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Wood countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovate-railroad-apartment-home-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lavanya and Regis&#8217; kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Probably America’s earliest type of kitchen countertop, wood is still desired for its natural beauty and warmth. Wood countertops can take moderate heat, but it will show burns, dings, and knife cuts. Fans consider the patina part of the appeal. Most damage can be sanded out; be sure to reapply food-safe mineral oil after any repair. Avoid installation in areas like the sink with prolonged exposure to moisture, which will cause it to swell. Clean with a damp sponge and a mild detergent. Hardwoods such as maple and oak are most commonly used as kitchen countertops, in a butcher-block pattern, which provides additional strength. Another pro of wood countertops: they&#8217;re a thriftier choice than many of the other types of countertops described above.</p>
<h4>Cost of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $35 per square foot; rarer woods can be more expensive</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easy to clean and repair</li>
<li>Good for cutting and chopping; knives won’t dull with contact</li>
<li>Won’t chip and objects dropped on it are less likely to break</li>
<li>Provides a rich look for a price lower than many other kitchen surfaces</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable to moisture, chemicals, and high heat, which cause permanent damage</li>
<li>Immediately shows signs of use</li>
<li>Expands or contracts with extreme swings in a moist environment</li>
<li>Requires food-safe sealant and regular care to preserve the surface</li>
</ul>
<h3>Laminate countertops<b></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26004 mb-10 size-full" title="Dekton laminate countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg" alt="Image of laminate kitchen countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Laminate countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan and Mike’s kitchen remodel</a></span><br />
<b></b></p>
<p>While not so rugged as most types of countertops today, laminate countertops still have plenty of upsides. To start, laminate countertops come in loads of patterns and colors and have a thrifty price tag. Made of resin-covered paper backed by plywood or particleboard, laminate does come with its share of synthetics. To ensure your indoor air quality, look for laminate countertops certified by Greenguard, like <a href="https://www.wilsonart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilsonart.</a> This indicates they are made from low-emitting materials that use formaldehyde-free paper and low- or non-toxic glues. This fashion-friendly surface can mimic the look of stone, wood, or fabric, or any graphic the manufacturer can think of. It will last for a few decades with proper care, which includes no direct cutting on the surface or exposure to acid or chemicals.</p>
<h4>Cost of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at $10 to $20 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Requires minimal care and no sealing</li>
<li>Available in a vast selection of patterns and colors</li>
<li>Easy to cut and install in tight spaces</li>
<li>Well-priced, particularly for a product with so many style options</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scratches and burns easily; sometimes impossible to repair</li>
<li>Seams show, particularly on solid colors</li>
<li>Allows only drop-in sinks, due to their construction</li>
<li>Anything other than the simplest edge treatment will drive up the price</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stainless steel countertops</h3>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44554 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg" alt="Image of stainless steel countertops in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></strong><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Stainless steel countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-check-all-the-boxes-apartment-for-empty-nesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beth and Bob&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Of all the types of kitchen countertops, stainless steel countertops are commonly used in commercial kitchens. This is because stainless steel can take a beating: from knives, high heat, most spills, and it’s completely anti-bacterial. You must avoid caustic chemicals, but since it’s water- and stain-proof, that’s not an issue unless you use it for something other than food prep. It comes in a number of finishes, including polished and brushed, which help hide scratches. Dings and dents will show up and are impossible to remove without displacing the countertop. But if you want a pro-style countertop, those battle scars can be shown with pride.</p>
<h4>Cost of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $70 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Super-resilient material is water-, stain-, fade-proof and resists bacteria</li>
<li>No need for sealing; cleans with simple detergent and water</li>
<li>Integrates seamlessly with features like drainboards, sinks, and backsplashes</li>
<li>Manufactured to exact specifications, so potentially seamless</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not suitable for cutting; must use a board to protect from knives</li>
<li>Shows the smallest scratches and dents, which are very hard to remove</li>
<li>Noisy when kitchen tools come in contact</li>
<li>Fabrication will drive up the price unless you buy a ready-made sink and drainboard unit</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><em>When Amanda and her husband set out to upgrade from their two-bedroom Windsor Terrace apartment in Brooklyn, they had a few adjectives in mind—light, airy, warm. They loved the neighborhood as well as the great light in their rental, but as work-from-home writers, desired larger bedrooms and a more spacious kitchen. They had also just gotten married, and if you’ve ever had a registry, you understand why they needed more kitchen storage! Here’s the story of how a visit with friends led them to a new home, and how an irresistible pattern sparked their kitchen design.</em></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22363 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-723x565.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="565" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-723x565.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-300x235.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-600x469.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Amanda’s initial intention was to stay in Windsor Terrace, the direction of her apartment search changed when she and her husband visited some friends at their new home in the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a> (CHC). They loved the feel of the complex and the apartment space itself, and realized that this was where they wanted to be. After a few months of checking out CHC listings as they came on the market, the couple landed a two-bedroom, one-bath apartment. Coincidentally, it was the mirror image of the one their friends owned!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As writers who both work from home, Amanda and her husband appreciated that the two bedrooms were equally sized; one could be used as a roomy home office as well as guest quarters for out-of-town visitors.  At around 1,000 square feet, the unit also had southern exposures that provided the lovely, warm light they had been in search of. The only issue was the kitchen: it was dark and closed off, and connected to a strange pass-through pantry that housed a bar counter. Although it had been recently renovated, the craftsmanship was poor, as there were already cracks and scratches in the cabinetry and flooring. At first sight, Amanda thought it would be a deal-breaker. She was eager for a simple move, and very hesitant to embark on a renovation of any kind. But slowly, she and her husband talked themselves into it—after all, the apartment was ideal in every other way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22336 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-Before-02" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So as they began the process of closing on the apartment, Amanda <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their kitchen renovation</a> to Sweeten. As a first-time renovator, she wasn’t sure how to decide between the various bids. Our in-house team came to the rescue: a call with one of Sweeten’s project advisors proved to be useful. The chat gave Amanda the chance to think out loud and consider the pros and cons of each bid, and she selected her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/338020 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22338 mb-24 mt-24 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-01" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22340 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amanda’s vision for the kitchen reflected the feeling she wanted for the apartment as a whole: clean and bright, but not too modern or sterile. “We both love to cook and wanted to feel comfortable there, like we could make a mess,” Amanda explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They began by knocking down the walls that separated the kitchen and pantry from the living room and dining nook. (This is a common theme in the CHC kitchens! For more inspiration, check out Laura and Matthew’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a>, as well as Mario and Joe’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>.) One of the doorways from the kitchen to the hallway was closed off to extend the kitchen space across the entire wall. In a brilliant move, their Sweeten contractor turned the unused space next to the refrigerator into diagonal built-in shelving, now the perfect spot to display photos and items from their travels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the space was opened up, the couple turned their attention to the details. Early on, Amanda fell in love with a Mediterranean-inspired patterned tile in black, grey and white, and built the entire kitchen design to complement it. Although she had originally considered the tile as a backsplash, it made more sense as flooring—a wise suggestion from her mom. For the millwork, their Sweeten contractor sourced custom cabinetry with simple lines in a white shaker style. A single set of glass doors was installed to break the solid run of uppers. A rich walnut countertop was chosen for an added layer of drama—they had first considered using a lighter wood, but the darker wood coordinated better with the floors, a decision supported by their contractor. Although <span style="color: #000000;">the work surface requires</span> some upkeep, Amanda reports that she “adores them!” Brass knobs and pulls for the cabinets were next, along with a vintage-inspired metal light fixture for the ceiling. While they kept their fairly new appliances from the apartment’s previous renovation, they added a wine fridge next to the dishwasher.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22342 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22341 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-05-06.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-05-06" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, Amanda worked with her Sweeten contractor to resolve issues as they arose. In one incident, the cabinetmaker realized that the measurements had been off, and that a cabinet would have been essentially unusable because of an immovable obstruction. He worked with the contractor to revise the layout overnight, and went into production with very little delay. Aside from this challenge, things went mostly according to plan, not to mention the shortest wait time for board approval that we’ve ever heard—about two weeks! (Could it be because Sweeten has done dozens of renovations in her building?)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that they’re done, Amanda has words of wisdom for aspiring renovators: “Don’t rush the process. We were impatient and moved all our things in right after the demolition stage. This meant that all of our belongings went into one bedroom, stacked and wrapped in plastic. We went to stay with our in-laws for the duration of the project. Our contractor was very understanding and worked quickly, but didn’t cut corners and finished on schedule—it took about a month in the end. Although this didn’t happen with us, a hurried contractor might be tempted to be less detailed-oriented. Trust the contractor! He knows what he’s doing and how long it’ll take to do it.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As a book lover, Amanda’s one regret is that they didn’t think to carve out space in the wall shared between the kitchen and the hallway for built-in bookshelves. Still, as a first-time renovator, we think she did an amazing job, and like other Sweeten clients, she can always return for another renovation someday!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thank you, Amanda, for sharing this lovely space. We hope that you and your husband enjoy cooking up your next literary masterpieces.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Prepping to pick kitchen countertop materials? Let these 9 Sweeten-remodeled kitchens inspire you</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just because kitchen counters get a lot of use in the home doesn&#8217;t mean they can&#8217;t also look beautiful! But where should you start when picking kitchen countertop materials? Well, there are a few things you should know about each type of countertop material before making your final selection. Here&#8217;s a rundown of our favorite kitchen countertops from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> renovation projects: gorgeous photos <em>and </em>material descriptions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27214 size-chrono" title="countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-723x482.jpg" alt="countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-13618"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Quartz Countertops</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quartz is a type of engineered stone, made from a combination of minerals, pigment, and resin. It is available in a wide range of colors and texture complexity. Quartz has become the most popular kitchen countertop material in <a href="https://sweeten.com/kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten kitchen renovations</a> probably because it is slightly less expensive, per square foot, than some of its other natural stone cousins, and because it is prized for extreme durability, resistance to stains and scratches, and its non-porous surface, which helps retain polish without sealants or waxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Ketrina’s Sweetened Clinton Hill Kitchen – Homeowner Guest Post" href="https://sweeten.com/clintonhillcoops/ketrinas-sweetened-clinton-hill-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13005 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-03.jpg" alt="Ketrina Quartz Kitchen Countertop" width="600" height="901" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-03-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“The stone is my favorite thing about the new space – it’s like having a piece of fine art right in my kitchen.” </strong></em><em><strong>– Ketrina, Clinton Hill homeowner</strong></em></p>
<p><a title="Ketrina’s Sweetened Clinton Hill Kitchen – Homeowner Guest Post" href="https://sweeten.com/clintonhillcoops/ketrinas-sweetened-clinton-hill-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ketrina in Clinton Hill</a> chose a quartzite countertop in cream-colored Madreperola (Mother of Pearl).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Claire &amp; Mike’s Park Slope Kitchen Renovation — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/claire-mikes-park-slope-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-12205 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SWEETEN_ClaireKitchen-08-600.jpg" alt="Claire Quartz Kitchen Countertop" width="600" height="883" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SWEETEN_ClaireKitchen-08-600.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SWEETEN_ClaireKitchen-08-600-204x300.jpg 204w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Claire &amp; Mike’s Park Slope Kitchen Renovation — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/claire-mikes-park-slope-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claire and Mike in Park Slope</a> chose a quartzite countertop in Dolomite “super white”.</p>
<p><a title="Heather’s Sweetened Upper West Side Kitchen Renovation – Homeowner Guest Post" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/heathers-sweetened-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-12971 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SWEETEN_HeatherUWSKitchen-08.jpg" alt="Heather Quartz Kitchen Countertop" width="600" height="898" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SWEETEN_HeatherUWSKitchen-08.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SWEETEN_HeatherUWSKitchen-08-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>“I love having guests over and can invite them to sit at the counter while I’m prepping snacks or a meal.” </strong></em><em><strong>– Heather, Sweeten homeowner </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Heather’s Sweetened Upper West Side Kitchen Renovation – Homeowner Guest Post" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/heathers-sweetened-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather</a> went with <a href="https://www.lgviaterausa.com/productOverviews/33/by-product-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG’s Viatera</a> quartz countertop in Cirrus for her Upper West Side kitchen.</p>
<h3><strong>Granite Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Granite is a natural stone with wide variation in color and detail. Its resistance to heat and scratches makes it a classic in the kitchen. Granite is known for its durability, but can require periodic re-sealing.</p>
<p><a title="Before &amp; After: Robyn and Alejandro’s Columbia Waterfront Industrial Kitchen — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/before-after-robyn-and-alejandros-columbia-waterfront-industrial-kitchen-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13524 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unnamed-2.jpg" alt="Robyn and Alejandro's Columbia Waterfront Kitchen -- Sweetened!" width="600" height="410" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unnamed-2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unnamed-2-300x205.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Before &amp; After: Robyn and Alejandro’s Columbia Waterfront Industrial Kitchen — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/before-after-robyn-and-alejandros-columbia-waterfront-industrial-kitchen-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robyn and Alejandro</a> in Brooklyn’s Columbia Waterfront District chose a granite countertop with gray undertones and luminous purple specks.</p>
<h3><strong>Marble Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marble has become an increasingly popular choice in luxury kitchens. More porous and softer than granite and engineered stone, (marble counters need to be sealed and are more susceptible to stains and etching), design-focused renovators seem to be willing to put up with marble&#8217;s drawbacks for its uncontested good looks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Five Design Tricks Transform an Uptown Kitchen" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/five-design-tricks-transform-uptown-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12607 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_UES-04.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_UES-04" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_UES-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_UES-04-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Lauren and Adam</a> included a Calacatta Caldia marble countertop with faint traces of green, gray, and yellow veining from <a href="https://www.abcworldwidestone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC Stone</a> in an Upper East Side kitchen.</p>
<h3><strong>Soapstone Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Highly heat-, stain-, and bacteria-resistant, soapstone is a non-porous natural stone that is available in a range of light to dark gray matte tones, all with subtle veining. Unlike granite and marble materials that require sealing, soapstone needs regular polishing with mineral oil to help conceal surface scratches and add patina.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Corey’s Williamsburg Kitchen Renovation — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13113 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-06" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-06-599x900.jpg 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Corey’s Williamsburg Kitchen Renovation — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corey in Williamburg</a> chose a soapstone countertop from a local supplier’s stone yard, and extended it all the way down into the sink.</p>
<h3><strong>Dekton Countertops</strong></h3>
<p>A tougher and more durable alternative to concrete countertops, Dekton is an ultra-compacted hybrid of raw materials common to quartz, porcelain, and glass. The result is a virtually impenetrable surface with a grittier, industrial feel.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12659" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_DanKitchen-02" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Dan and Mike’s Manhattan Kitchen Renovation — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan and Mike</a> in Hell’s Kitchen chose a <a href="https://www.dekton.com/usa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dekton</a> waterfall counter in Chrome.</p>
<h3><strong>Butcher block countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ideal for adding warmth and charm, butcher block wood countertops provide a hardworking surface for food preparation. A number of Sweetened kitchens have mixed wood countertop sections with other materials like natural or engineered stone. This mix provides different options for food prep and serving. While butcher block is naturally heat-resistant and affordable, it can stain and age, wear in high-use areas and requires regular sanding and oiling to protect the wood.</p>
<p><a title="Five Design Tricks Transform an Uptown Kitchen" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/five-design-tricks-transform-uptown-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12604 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_UES-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_UES-05" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_UES-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_UES-05-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Lauren and Adam</a> included a maple butcher block prep nook with a knife storage block in an Upper East Side kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12526" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-10.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill Co-op Renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-10.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-10-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A <a title="Scandi in Brooklyn: Sweetened Clinton Hill Co-op Renovation" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/scandi-brooklyn-sweetened-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton Hill couple</a> chose a butcher block counter to compliment the white on white palette with wood accents in their kitchen.</p>
