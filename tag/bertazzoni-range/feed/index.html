</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Laying out the plan for high ceilings</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The homeowners closed on an 850-square-foot loft apartment in a multi-building complex in Greenwich Village, just a short stroll from Washington Square Park. The building dated to 1890 and had formerly housed a cast-iron factory. The apartment itself benefited from the structure’s history with high 16-foot ceilings and original detailing. The interior finishes were outdated, however, since it had been decades since the last renovation. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47451" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25.jpg" alt="loft homeowner" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They planned to convert the one-bedroom apartment into a two-bedroom while making full use of the ceiling height. A mezzanine level around much of the apartment would allow for storage and display of their art and decorative pieces. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen was tucked away in a dark corner of the loft, with dark wood cabinetry and black countertops adding to the gloom. It made more sense to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/swap-rooms-better-layout-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swap the locations of the bathroom</a> and the kitchen. This brought the kitchen closer to the the dining and living spaces. The bathroom itself needed a gut renovation. Its finish materials and all the wiring and plumbing were deteriorating.</span></p>

<h3>Out with the debris, in with the light</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As their Sweeten contractor began to demo the space, he unearthed&#8230;actual earth. The contractor found about eight inches of “some kind of dirt floor” beneath the flooring. He had to excavate it along with the rest of the demolition debris—a first for this seasoned contractor. He speculated it was perhaps due to the building’s past as a factory.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They worked to create a gallery-like space featuring bright white walls, highlighted with blackened steel accents. Keeping the finishes simple allowed the airiness of the space to shine.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47437 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16.jpg" alt="kitchen storage" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<h3>A triumph of clerestory windows</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although there are now two bedrooms rather than one, the homeowners were able to preserve a sense of expansiveness by not taking the walls all the way up to the ceiling. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/transom-windows-let-the-light-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clear glass clerestory windows</a> were installed</span><span class="s1"> in the bedrooms, as well as in the bathroom so that natural light could still shine in each part of the renovated loft. </span></p>
<h3>An integrated kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout the hallways, bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom, a steel rail was installed for a custom library ladder, to give access to the mezzanine areas. This unique system used brushed steel for the rail and brackets, and black-anodized aluminum for the portable ladder, to make it light enough to carry from room to room. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47446" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Storage-12-scaled.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the living room lost a few feet to create the second bedroom, it gained plenty of linear feet in display storage as a result of the loft renovation. Custom black steel bookcases run along the length of one wall. The contractor secured these shelves through to the studs as they were rebuilding the apartment, so they&#8217;ll be able to handle any load. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The living room space opens up to the dining nook, which also houses an upright piano. An <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/g2262/gallery-wall-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adjacent gallery wall</a>, decorated with black-framed art, provides visual interest along the interior wall. Recessed lighting and statement pendants support the minimalist aesthetic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47429" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled.jpg" alt="master bedroom" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47433 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled.jpg" alt="library ladder" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<h3>Extra storage for the bathroom</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the smaller bedroom next to the kitchen, they created a lofted sleeping area for guests with a simple mattress set-up, which is also accessible via the library ladder. The elevated sleeping loft allows the floor area of the room to be used by the homeowners as a closet and dressing area. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47427" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26.jpg" alt="loft bed" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47452" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled.jpg" alt="bathroom remodel" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom received a similarly modern treatment with a deep soaking tub. A matte black towel hook and shower and sink fixtures create contrast, and match the overall black-and-white motif. Unusually, the homeowners were able to add storage above the shower area, also accessible with the portable library ladder. As with the overhead kitchen storage, the space above was built without shelves or compartments, to accommodate large or odd-shaped items. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple now has a beautiful home that handles their storage, showcases their art and treasures, lets in the light—and even lets them share their space with overnight guests.  </span></p>

</ul>
<h3>A living room renovation gives room for a fave sport</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes even man-cave passions are well worth making room for. Designer Bennett Gale knew this when he agreed to help his friend Dan, who had <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased a one-bedroom apartment</a> in a 1960 New York City building, with its remodel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“For the longest time, the only piece of furniture that Dan had—before he even bought a bed—was a pool table,” recalled Bennett, who works as a project manager for a luxury real-estate developer. The dark-wood billiards console—sturdy, angular, and clad in camel-toned felt—was a prized possession and an essential feature in the project. Dan, a finance executive who’d moved into the co-op about a year before starting on the redesign, had made it the apartment’s centerpiece.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A pool table in a Manhattan apartment may sound like a literal elephant in the room, but Bennett, who had been close with Dan since college, understood its importance and was happy to discuss it. The table had a modern design and good bones. With a set of 4 &#8211; 5 table leaves that let it multitask as a dining surface, the nifty four-legged table was also practical—Dan had gathered many a friend around it. The issue was that his otherwise sparsely set living room felt tight when the table was in use. “I wanted to create more space around it,” said Dan. Plus, more elbow room would be useful for pool cues!</span></p>
<h3>Planning an entertainment space at home</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dan and Bennett worked together to post the job on Sweeten and soon hired a contractor. Then they set out to upgrade the co-op into the ultimate bachelor’s pad. (Note: Dan&#8217;s girlfriend has moved in since the renovation—and reportedly, loves the space.) The original scope of the project, Bennett said, grew substantially. “We’d planned to open up the wall between the kitchen and the living room, but once we dug into the plans, it became clear that by taking out a few walls and relocating a closet, we could make better use of the space.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He proposed a full reconfiguration that would knock out a lot of flow-hampering sheetrock, give the kitchen an eye-catching redo, and elevate the living room to become a spacious entertaining hub. The makeover would bring light and a chic, loft-like sprawl to the downtown apartment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Conversations about specifics began in the kitchen. Bennett and Dan put a lot of research into cohesive surfacing choices. “Dark-wood parquet flooring dominates a lot of the space,” Bennett said, “so we lightened up the walls and chose materials that coordinated with the wood.” Dan opted for kitchen cabinets in a custom textured veneer with blond accents; dark matte-bronze cabinet hardware and coordinating lighting fixtures complement the stained wood. The natural marble that Dan settled on for the countertops is a warm white with earth-toned veining that echoes the deep brown pool and dining table.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45404 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="kitchen bar" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Sample testing the countertop materials</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Quality and durability were primary factors. Dan had decided to go “all in” on <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural marble for the countertops</a> and backsplash. “We did countless tests on countertop samples in order to determine whether we should go with honed marble or polished,” Bennett said. “Olive oil, red wine, hot sauce, pickle juice, and soda were tested to observe how it would stain or etch.” Dan chose a matte honed finish, which is more resistant to discoloration and allows scratches and marks to blend. “From multiple slabs, we identified one with as much veining and movement as possible,” Bennett said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With materials picked and sourced, the real work began. The crew opened the kitchen, installed cabinetry and appliances, and created a three-stooled stretch of counter seating on the opening’s living-room side. From there, the apartment’s other unnecessary walls got the sledgehammer. Bennett’s plan included taking out a hallway wall to give more space around the pool table.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To complete the space expansion, the removal of a corner closet revealed a protruding column. Bennett designed a dry bar to fill the accidental niche. “That awkward corner became a great opportunity,” Bennett said. “We negotiated with the contractor to have the bar included in the build-out. It ended up as a great display.” The closet was relocated to an oversized and inefficient foyer.</span></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Choosing the right general contractor team</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is the case in most every home-construction job, the team hit some snags. During demolition, contractors discovered that the electrical wiring needed to be upgraded. Bennett emphasizes the importance of reading and understanding co-op or condo board rules and sharing them with contractors, who must not only work within the regulations, but also lock in the appropriate licenses and insurance coverages for the project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A cooperative relationship between the construction crew and building staff is an absolute must, according to Bennett. “Get the super involved early,” he says. &#8220;These individuals almost always have previous experience with renovations in the building, and can often provide valuable insight on the exact issues you’ll encounter.” Fortunately, Dan received support from Sweeten throughout the process, and from Bennett, his friend (and architect!) “I would have been lost without his experience, guidance, and recommendations, not to mention his help pushing back on the contractors and the building when I needed it,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All challenges aside, though, “I’m very happy with the finished product,” Dan said. “I accomplished exactly what I was looking to do.” </span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Bennett and Dan, for sharing the results of a great collaboration! </em></p>

<h3>A charming (but not functional) Colonial house</h3>
<p>We had been dividing our time between a farmhouse in Dutchess County and a walk-up apartment in Brooklyn. When our son was born, neither of these homes was quite suited to us. We decided to find a place in between with a shorter commute for my husband, more social opportunities for me, and easy access to the home.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg" alt="yonkers colonial house" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-45098 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p>When we first saw the house, we were charmed by the time-capsule of a kitchen—salmon Formica, dark-wood cabinets, and a dishwasher that predated the other elements. That said, we knew we would eventually update the kitchen. Having a lavatory on the ground floor and not having to run upstairs was also on the wishlist.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45113 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2.jpg" alt="Yonkers family portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19.jpg" alt="drip dishware collection" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45107" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Their Colonial renovation adds heated floors</h3>
<p>The existing kitchen had one radiator, which was buried in the back of a custom cabinet. It was a clever solution at the time, but ate up a lot of cabinet space and wasn’t heat-efficient. We decided to install a radiant floor heating system that we could run off of our existing hot-water heating system. A more formal, fully-functional <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island would offer storage</a>, outlets, and a bigger counter area.</p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17.jpg" alt="kitchen display ideas" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45105" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="kitchen with natural wood cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45101" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wanted to create a better flow of traffic and light. The main entrance to the kitchen from the dining room was a narrow 28-inch-wide doorway. It made the kitchen feel isolated from the rest of the house. Bringing down the wall would not have respected the house’s character. Instead, the opening was widened and centered between the two rooms to bring more natural light into the north-facing kitchen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18.jpg" alt="Bertazzoni stove" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45106" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen storage ideas" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45100" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Balancing the kitchen structures</h3>
<p>Some infrastructural elements dictated a lot of the design. One was that the major waste line for the three upstairs bathrooms lays along the kitchen’s exterior wall. It had been boxed out previously, and the existing cabinets had been customized around it. We didn’t want to relocate that line, so we decided to figure out how to incorporate it.</p>
<p>The second element was a sheetrock box beam of sorts. We didn’t know what was in it, but since it was asymmetrically placed and not detailed like the house’s other box beams, we assumed it was hiding something expensive to move. Our thought was, let’s give this weird beam and column matching mates to create symmetry.</p>
<h3>Odd-ball elements</h3>
<p>These design decisions hid the two odd-ball elements by making it look like they’d always been there. Bonus: We made that second column a sneaky little cabinet right between the sink/dishwasher and our espresso machine. It’s the perfect spot for drinking glasses and cups. We love it!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48250" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p>I wanted to bring the warmth and softness of natural wood into the kitchen, so I chose a darker wood for the cabinets that echoes our furniture. A built-in pantry was replaced with custom open shelving. The adjustable shelves look like they might have been there when the house was built. It enhances the room’s original feel and provides a display for our brown-drip dishware collection.</p>
<h3>Turning closets into a powder room</h3>
<p>There was <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-renovations-that-added-another-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no bathroom on the first floor</a>. We combined two closets—approximately 4’ x 4’—and some square footage where we used to hang coats by the back door. The sacrifice was worth it for what would become the most frequented bathroom in the house. A pocket door with frosted glass saved space and allowed light to flow through. We installed Art Deco wallpaper, wainscoting, a picture rail, and paint in neutral tones.</p>
<p>Though manufacturers say that you can install wood flooring over radiant heat systems, it made me leery, and wood is not an efficient conductor of heat. I was certain I wanted tile, but one that wouldn&#8217;t appear cold or hard.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The right contractor for our Colonial house renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten helped us find a group of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried-and-true general contractors</a> to vet. In the past, we’d tried a few recommended by neighbors, but this time that didn’t work. And this project was too big an investment to just pick somebody out of a hat. It was great to be able to talk through everything with a Sweeten professional and get a curated list. I doubt we&#8217;d have found our contractor on our own, and I&#8217;m so glad we did.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were much more organized than contractors we&#8217;d worked with previously. Our contractor seemed to have experience and know-how beyond his years. When we ran into uncertainties, he was great at suggesting possible solutions. There was a structural issue discovered during demolition that required changes to the design layout. He was quick to help us with potential resolutions, down to providing revised elevations so we could visualize the new design. And he always discussed costs with us before we signed off. They also provided spreadsheets to help me keep track of all the elements I needed to order and have on-site.</span></p>

<h3>Veteran renovators share advice</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with our renovation was waiting for it to be finished! Time moves slowly when you&#8217;re living on the second floor of your home, feeding a family from a makeshift kitchen in your bedroom. This was no fault of our contractors. Our city building department took three months to issue our permits.</p>
<p>If you can, live with your space for a while before renovating. You&#8217;ll end up with a much clearer picture of how to make your new space work best for you.</p>
<p>Also, always budget for 10-20% more than your original estimate, especially for kitchens and baths in old houses. This is our fourth renovation experience, and there has always been a major structural or plumbing issue (or both!) that have come up. It’s never pleasant, but if you plan for it, it&#8217;s way less painful.</p>
<p>Our new space makes us feel happy! We really love all of the new millwork in the home remodel, it feels so harmonious with the rest of our beautiful old Colonial home.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Amanda and Cory, for sharing your Colonial home remodel story with us!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Smart upgrades for the kitchen and bathroom solve pesky problems</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When Ryan, an editor, and Sophie, a paralegal, envisioned their renovation, they knew they needed to address the problems they inherited from the “quick and dirty reno” completed in 2009, the year Ryan bought the apartment. The advantage of waiting years to renovate? “It was abundantly clear how we utilized the kitchen,” says Ryan, adding “I had 10 years to save up because even a modest renovation like this one isn’t cheap in NYC!” In their 750-square foot, prewar one-bedroom on the Upper West Side, the partners agreed that the odd-shaped kitchen needed rearranging to take advantage of every square inch; and the bathroom required rescuing from a “South Florida Grandma aesthetic.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i> To tackle <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/37791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the project, they posted</a> on </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span class="s2"><i>Sweeten</i></span></a><i>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, and </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169#overview"><span class="s2"><i>chose their contractor</i></span></a><i>. </i></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44140 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7.jpg" alt="kitchen-white-cabinets-bar seating-remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Ryan</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whoever designed the last renovation really did not think things through. In the kitchen, which is an odd trapezoidal space, the priority was maximizing both storage and counter space, and minimizing clutter. For instance, there was a 24-inch soffit between the top of the cabinets and the ceiling that was just empty space. So we knew we’d need cabinets extending to the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44150 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13.jpg" alt="renovators portrait-new york city" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sink was on a diagonal resulting in a large dead space. And the refrigerator was a huge obstruction at the back of the room and the first thing you see when you enter the foyer. Its positioning made the kitchen seem smaller and it just needed to find a new spot. We weren’t sure if that was possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom was small and dark with very little natural light. The vanity was made of builder-grade particle board that had swollen with moisture, and the medicine cabinet protruded. We were intent on transforming the look and feel of the bathroom—even the toilet was pink! The living room got a refresh with repainted walls, a replastered ceiling, and new sconce lighting.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">The contractor’s millworker was about twice the cost of </span><span class="s3">Ikea and Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, but still about $5,000 less than the cabinets in the next price tier.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the kitchen, I commissioned a one-hour consult with an interior designer, Clare of <a href="https://www.121studio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One to One Studio</a>, while still planning everything out. The designer suggested moving the refrigerator to the corner and relocating the doorway to accommodate the fit. That might seem obvious in retrospect, but to me, it was a revelation. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We went with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/product-101-kitchen-cabinet-door-materials-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinets so everything</a> would look integrated. The odd-shaped kitchen space came with difficult angles, pipes, and protrusions. We went to Ikea to experiment with a layout, but couldn’t get their premade boxes to fit in a satisfactory way. I also tried </span><span class="s3">Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, which had more options in terms of box sizes, but I worried the boxes wouldn’t be delivered in time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor’s millworker was about twice the cost of </span><span class="s3">Ikea and Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, but still about $5,000 less than the cabinets in the next price tier. He was able to build boxes that accommodated the kitchen’s unusual dimensions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen floor tile came from the designer, during our consult. I asked her specifically what I should get since I was stumped by all the options. She recommended black slate tile: durable, attractive, and cheap. Her basic ethos was “make it look expensive without being expensive.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The backsplash, on the other hand, was a splurge. We always </span><span class="s3">wanted</span><span class="s1"> scallop tiles. Initially, we envisioned a teal color but we realized it was just too loud. So we went with a scalloped tile in muted but varied gray tones. The countertop was another more expensive finish: Empira White featured veining we really liked that complemented the backsplash.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophie </span><span class="s3">wanted</span><span class="s1"> slab cabinets without any pulls, and I agreed. By then, I was really <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-selecting-and-ordering-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suffering from decision fatigue</a> and didn’t have the wherewithal to evaluate the merits of different cabinet hardware!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophie chose the kitchen to be clean and streamlined, whereas I wanted the bathroom to have quirkier touches. I put together a sort of mood board where we considered a bunch of looks like intricate marble mosaics, but marble stains and needs a lot of upkeep. Plus, our contractor recommended we get large-format tile, due to some peculiarities of the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We ultimately chose 36”x36” glazed porcelain tile that looks like marble at about $4/square foot, which was pretty reasonable, especially since we tiled up to the ceiling. It also worked well on the floor given the bathroom’s size constraints.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The vanity was more of a splurge, but I justified it because I hadn’t seen other vanities quite like it. And it fit. A 25-inch vanity would have been too small, and a 30-inch vanity would have been crammed in. The Goldilocks vanity needed to be between 25 to 30 inches, but powder room vanities sit comfortably within that range. I just had to pay twice what I’d initially budgeted. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-white-bathtub"  class="alignnone wp-image-44065 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1.jpg" alt="white bathroom with white bathtub and white vanity with stand and large frameless mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The renovation itself mostly went off without a hitch, from getting board approval to designing it to seeing the project through to completion. Our contractor helped a lot with the paperwork. Between the management company and the board, there were A LOT of forms that I needed to put together. Luckily, the contractor had worked in the building before, which is one of the reasons I hired him. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor was really good at keeping me in the loop and letting me know what was happening and when. Managing and communicating expectations is a big part of a successful partnership. Have a plan before you hire a contractor, know what you want and why you want it, so you’ll have a better idea of where to compromise with your decisions and where not to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the renovation, my downstairs neighbor was particularly helpful. She winters in Florida, and let us stay in her apartment, meaning we didn’t have to find a place to crash. I work from home most days, so I could stay in the building and check out the renovation throughout the day to make sure we were adhering to the plan. Also, I didn’t have to find a place to board my cat, Titus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Besides the clean look, I love how our new kitchen is all integrated. From a functionality standpoint, I’m very pleased with its usability. It easily accommodates two people working at the same time, has tons of storage space and counter space, yet still seems open.</span></p>
<p><em><span class="s1">Thank you, Sophie and Ryan, for sharing your journey with us!</span></em></p>

<h3>Finding a dream-like duplex in the Upper East Side</h3>
<p>It takes just a word to sum up this family’s home-finding experience: miraculous. In the cosmopolitan stretches of Manhattan’s Upper East Side, where even the parks are tiny and concrete-dipped, Jenn and Jon, six-year-old Elliott, two-year-old Abigail, and their Cockapoo, Zucca, found a place that can only have dropped out of a dream. The 2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom duplex in Yorkville, a tony area near the East River’s edge, was in a 1910 building a stone’s throw from Gracie Mansion, the New York City mayor’s residence.</p>

<p>The story was that decades back, a former owner of the five-floor, then ten-unit building had combined three one-bedroom apartments to create a huge two-level residence with sole access to a sprawling rear garden. “W<span class="s1">e fell in love with the unbelievable backyard garden</span>,” said Jenn, the executive director of a family foundation, not to mention the amazing location. The problem was—and every Manhattan miracle has one—that the duplex needed renovation work.</p>
<p>From what Jenn and her partner, Jon, a lawyer at a bank, could see, little had been touched since the 1970s. The floors throughout were in poor condition. The white laminate kitchen was 40 years old and had an unfriendly layout. It was a daunting prospect for a couple with no construction experience, but before long, they were in contract. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/33394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their duplex renovation</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors, hired <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their design-build firm</a>, and jumped in.</p>

<h3>Plotting the &#8220;must-haves&#8221; for the duplex renovation</h3>
<p>Jenn and Jon planned on four months for the duplex renovation. &#8216;Apartment is in good shape and does not need to be gutted,&#8217; they’d stated in their Sweeten post. “We knew we needed a full reno on the galley kitchen,” Jenn said, “but most everything else just needed a serious refresh.” Light updates were given to the 2.5 bathrooms including the master, the kids&#8217; bath, and a half bath.</p>
<blockquote><p>We fulfilled it with everything from the new U-shaped eat-in banquette to the pantry, where huge pull-out drawers let the kids access their own snacks.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the “Must Do” list finalized, Jenn and Jon got to work with their Sweeten contractor’s design team. “We wanted a transitional-modern space that was light and airy,” Jenn said. “Our look, playing off of the brand-new white oak floors we were putting in and the existing black hardware like the stair rail and window frames, was ‘black, white, and wood.’” For inspiration, they followed the Instagram #BlackWhiteWood hashtag, which delivered great ideas.</p>

<p>Beginning in the kitchen, they got to work on what bothered them most: not old cabinetry, but two light-blocking openings that made the galley room feel closed off. The first was a partial wall between the eating area and the kitchen. The second, on the opposite end, was a too-small pocket door inhibiting flow to the living room. “The ground floor has only two natural light sources—the front kitchen window, which overlooks the street, and the garden door to the back—so this opening up was essential,” Jenn said.</p>
<p>By knocking out the divisive walls, they maximized light and flow, making the kitchen a focal point of their home and family life. “Having a well-laid-out space where we can cook and eat together as a family was one of our priorities,” Jenn said, “and we fulfilled it with everything from the new U-shaped eat-in banquette to the pantry, where huge pull-out drawers let the kids access their own snacks.”</p>

<p>In the kitchen and the apartment’s other rooms, Jenn and Jon selected materials in classic styles, like Shaker cabinets and five-panel doors, but finished with a modern flair. “We said no to crown molding,” Jenn said, “and kept the four-inch floorboards natural by sealing them with a white-infused stain.” As planned, they riffed off the existing black hardware, but mixed in metals, including brass light fixtures and stainless kitchen appliances, to relax the overall effect. They were stymied by the choices—working across so many rooms, they seemed endless. “It was hard making so many ‘permanent’ decisions over a short time,” Jenn said.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">They soon realized they would have to install new white oak floors throughout, since the existing ones were stained, warped, or patched with cheap flooring that had been laid down years ago. (“They were mismatched, different heights, just an overall disaster,” Jenn said.) </span><span style="color: #333333;">The stairs and risers, however, were sanded and stained to match the new floors. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/creative-radiator-covers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radiators worked</a>, but needed covers; the through-wall air conditioners screamed for an upgrade. The <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closets would get built-ins</a>, and the family needed more shelves, nooks, and stowaways up and down. New doors and molding would be necessary. Oh, and of course they would paint—everywhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">A large bedroom on the second floor—that was once two separate rooms— would be divided again into two kids’ rooms complete with new closets in each. Their bathrooms, formerly a Jack-and-Jill with two entrances, had a wall built in turning them into two separate spaces once again. </span></p>
<p>“Jon was the one with the vision,” Jenn said. “We bought the apartment knowing it would need work to feel like our ‘forever home,’ but I was concerned going in about how much effort it would require.” They’d preferred a turnkey place but realized, having looked long and hard, that finding a comparable, renovated apartment they could afford, especially in such a prime location, would be near-impossible. And so, with a commitment to work together—because they’d heard too many stories of renovations tearing couples apart—they agreed to make it happen, in the name of a big, beautiful city home.</p>
<h3>Getting a hang of the renovation learning curve</h3>
<p>As first-time renovators, Jenn and Jon not only felt overwhelmed by the day-to-day, but knew little about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budgets, timeframes, or permits</a>. “We went in blind and had to learn fast!” Jenn said. <span class="s1">Because of this, and due to large last-minute changes to the plan—including an unforeseen full-frame exterior backdoor to the garden and brand new solid hardwood floors throughout—they exceeded their budget by about 30%.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43217 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07.jpg" alt="Guest bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) Half bathroom</em></span></span></p>
<p>Still, Jenn said, it was worth it. “Our new home has significantly impacted our quality of life. The garden, where the kids can run free, is the biggest contributor to that, but a fabulous eat-in kitchen and two floors for stretching out are big assets, too,” she said. “To us, the place lives more like a house than an apartment—we are truly in love.”</p>

<h3 class="p5">Landing the perfect space</h3>
<p class="p4">We had a clear vision from the day of the close: to create a living space with a look and feel of casual luxury. The building, in historic DUMBO, is a block from both Brooklyn Bridge Park and the waterfront. The apartment is a true two-bedroom—with windows and natural light in both—overlooking the street and trees. The price point was reasonable enough that we could buy the condo and have money to renovate before moving in. Mitzie is a furniture designer and we were confident the space was a good canvas. It would make a good home.</p>

<h3 class="p5">New home office, featured wall panels, coordinated bathrooms</h3>
<p class="p4">We were looking to add character to each room, with a focus on mixed materials and quality finishes. We were excited about renovating the kitchen as well as two bathrooms using the same tile in different ways. The master bedroom would be outfitted with wall paneling. Maximizing storage was key since Mitzie works from home. The second bedroom would be her workspace, and she wanted (needed!) to separate work from life with an office. We were determined to accomplish it all, transforming the condo into a home reflecting both our personalities and styles.</p>

<h3>A mood board emerges</h3>
<p>Once we’d hired our Sweeten contractors—and asked a lot of questions about costs and the timeline—we began with concept boards. These kept us organized with the number of decisions we had to make throughout the planning. We started with a set of detailed floor plans and measurements (CAD renderings were helpful for seeing the big picture). The color palette was off-white, blue, and gray, with accents of pink in textiles and black for hardware. We created a list of materials we wanted to incorporate such as marble, brass, and wood. All of these hues and surfaces are visible in our living room, which is the heart of our place.</p>

We installed <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/should-i-refinish-my-hardwood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white oak wood floors</a> throughout the apartment to lighten up the entire space. It has a subtle, scraped texture that feels wonderful to walk on barefoot. Since the same wide floorboards were used throughout the apartment, we eliminated the saddles at our door thresholds to maximize that continuity. We made a schedule for ordering materials and a checklist for received items—a system that carried us through the renovation, helping us track appliances, fixtures, hardware, and odds and ends.</p>

<h3>The key to open concept spaces: built-in cabinets</h3>
<p>The kitchen was a dark and boxy room that needed love. Our goals were to maximize storage, update the appliances, and simplify the overall aesthetic. This was especially important as the kitchen opens to our living room. A large island was a key addition, to function as a dining and entertaining area. We chose a refrigerator and freezer with panel doors matching the cabinets. On the other end of the kitchen wall, our contractors removed the door frames holding the washer/dryer for a streamlined effect.</p>

<h3>Wall paneling defines a plain wall</h3>
<p class="p1">Wall paneling was added to give our bedroom depth and character which became a feature. This accent wall moved the attention away from some existing buildouts in each corner of the room, and a recessed area that could not be reconfigured. Our contractors hired a master carpenter who created the wall paneling with 2 1/2&#8243;-wide lengths of plywood, and finished the wall with satin-finish paint. In this room as well as the second bedroom, which became Mitzie’s office, we added custom closets and remote-control blinds. Mitzie’s plants in her office were outfitted with grow lights to keep them green year-round.</p>

<p>We found a great tile company and chose the same style for the floors in both bathrooms but installed in different patterns. Our big goal for the master bath was to add a double vanity—a tight squeeze and ultimately a feat, since we didn’t find a 60-inch-wide unit with storage that we both liked. The vanity we chose has no cabinets, but luckily, during demolition, our contractors pointed out an extra 6-8&#8243; in depth between the wall studs—space for hidden storage. The carpenter who’d created the bedroom paneling custom-made a four-door, concealed built-in. The shower recesses and door saddles are cut from the same marble slab as the kitchen countertops.</p>

<h3>During the renovation process</h3>
<p>Throughout the renovation, our Sweeten general contractor proved critical in the job’s technical aspects. Their invaluable suggestions included creating a dropped ceiling to add recess lighting, hiding wires and cables, adding electrical sockets and USB plug-ins, and installing dimmers. Our apartment was filled every day with a team of busy contractors and subcontractors, including painters, an electrician, a carpenter, and a plumber. It surprised us, but once the project was complete, we missed seeing and chatting with these talented guys. Sweeten helped us find our renovation team and advised us on important points like timelines and communication strategies.</p>

Mitzie and I didn’t know how hard conveying a bathroom-tile design over FaceTime could prove—the flooring almost broke us up! But a five-month renovation is survivable, even when in the end you are living out of a suitcase at a dear friend’s house. In the end, we were thrilled with our relaxed and beautiful apartment and proud of our role in making it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">For Frans, a real estate broker, and his wife, Dalal, downsizing from a 2,500 square foot Flatiron District loft to a one-bathroom studio in neighboring Gramercy Park raised only one challenge: Where to put the mudroom! Size was hardly an issue for this unflappable couple, who set out to fit a few custom features into a much lower-maintenance space and came to Sweeten for a general contractor who could bring the vision together. Read on to see how they made room for a mudroom, master closets, and sleeping space for four in this mighty studio!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20138 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-25-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><span id="more-18627"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal were happy to leave behind extra square footage but wanted to bring a few specific features to their new home: A mudroom, to ward off sooty and sometimes snowy layers from city streets, wardrobe closets organized for two, and modern electrical wiring that would support an integrated system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They’d decided on this particular studio apartment because it offered a smaller but markedly similar version of the living room in their loft, and because eventually they planned to relocate to Long Island. So, a revamp would make this home convenient and comfortable until their next adventure, and put everything in place for a future crash pad. Frans enlisted a<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>to achieve the loft-like space they had in mind, while personalizing a number of key features throughout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main studio space was a standard boxy room that backed up to one wall of windows and existing decor was mostly dark and decades old. Because of the single source of light, it took some imagination to carve up the room for use in different ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal designated the windowed area as their new living room, and aimed to update and expand the kitchen, bathroom, and wardrobes while incorporating an urban mudroom into a large hall closet. They also wanted to replace all of the dated finishes throughout the apartment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting with the dark parquet floors, their contractor and his team made way for 7-inch white oak planks from Siberian Wood Flooring, and installed them throughout the home, even replacing the kitchen’s old linoleum black and white floors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original 6 x 8-foot kitchen nook offered very little workspace surrounded by drab brown decor. Directly across from the nook was an oversized closet, which Frans hoped to incorporate into a new, larger kitchen design. The team took on major demolition to create a larger footprint and a workable U-shape, allowing for openness and access. They designed and built custom kitchen cabinetry, finished in putty-gray paint for the bottom cabinets, and white with glass panels for the upper line with seamless metal hardware. A number of cool custom features for specific storage needs are sprinkled throughout, and walnut shelving over the new under-mount sink helps extend the kitchen&#8217;s depth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">White linoleum counters were tossed and replaced with natural white Bianco Brazilian marble with gray veining. Frans and Dalal chose a matte white glass subway-style tile for the backsplash, which now runs up the length of the wall by the new island, where two dining seats, plenty of additional counter space, and black pendant lighting are in easy reach. Top-grade stainless steel appliances replaced the tiny outdated white units, and a large professional-grade hood was fashioned over the 30-inch Bertazzoni gas oven range.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the old closet, their contractor turned part of that into the mudroom Frans and Dalal were after, complete with custom shelving and various storage needs. And as an extension for the new kitchen, white custom cabinetry conceals the refrigerator and houses an exposed wet bar and wine fridge.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal worked with Kris to create two customized and flexible sleeping spaces. Kris built sliding accordion doors out of walnut wood and opaque resin that stack together out of the way when opened, or become solid partition walls when extended and closed off.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom section, Kris built a king-sized platform bed and matching nightstands. In the living room, the team devised a plan for a customized built-in wall unit, incorporating a queen-sized murphy bed and guest closet all conveniently and seamlessly hidden behind white lacquered plywood. Across the room from this addition, Kris installed a single walnut shelf running alongside the wall and just off the floor to corral entertainment equipment and living room knick-knacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18637 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-08-12.gif" alt="sliding accordion doors" width="600" height="401" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18648 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-27-31.gif" alt="murphy bed" width="600" height="401" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18646 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-25.jpg" alt="gramercy studio apartment" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-25.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-25-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18647" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-26.jpg" alt="modern manhattan studio" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-26.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-26-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Frans and Dalal had a few simple ideas in mind. Plain white tiles, dim lighting, and very old superficial hardware had outworn their welcome. The couple planned to get rid of all the existing dated decor, change the footprint to allow for a larger, more accessible layout, and customize the adjoining closet to cater to “his and her” needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kris tore everything out and rotated the footprint by 90 degrees to swap the shower and vanity, allowing for greater use of space overall. Old floor tiles were ripped out and light gray ceramic tiles, mimicking that of stone, went down in their place. Upon entering the bathroom directly off the bedroom, you’ll find an oversized white porcelain sink nestled into a new walnut wood vanity built entirely by Kris, finished with ultra modern red and silver metal hardware. To the left of the vanity stands a new glass shower, bedecked with skateboard street-art-style wall tiles for a very artistic, creatively modern, and very hip “New York” aesthetic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new wardrobe situation is impressive. A walk-in closet was already in place, but the couple had a better plan to build a more streamlined and highly organized pass-through closet. Using the door to the old closet, Kris custom built movable shelving units out of corresponding walnut wood for shoes and other sections for hanging clothes. These movable units lead to a separate bathroom entry to the back of the studio, where the living room sits. The homeowners also gained a new compact washer/dryer to complete the turn-around.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Not one to miss the tiniest of details, Frans had the entire apartment wired for temperature, lighting, and sound control he conveniently accesses via phone. Frans and Dalal not only got the mudroom, but also managed to fold in multiple, flexible spaces to this origami apartment. Their new “studio” might be the only one in all of Manhattan with as many separate rooms as they now have, perfectly positioned within one unique space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years after Claudia purchased her one-bedroom, one-bath apartment in a quaint Upper East Side co-op, she felt ready to renovate. Since arriving in 2001, this software engineer knew that she’d eventually need to address the 30 year-old carpeting, fixtures, and odd space issues&#8230;or simply move on and find a new home. Loving everything about the building, the neighborhood, and her lifestyle, she decided to stay put and find a designer who could bring an architectural approach and a restorative eye to this lovely space. Read on for the stunning reveal of Claudia’s thoughtful and personal apartment renovation!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18472 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg" alt="apartment renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-18306"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia first readied herself with a straightforward list of tasks she wanted to accomplish. Sure, the place hadn’t been updated anywhere in three decades, so finishes throughout were more than dated. But she also craved more space, and after seeing neighboring units without the built-ins and boxy windows that had been added in a mid-80s renovation, she realized she might be able to reclaim some hidden square footage (and long-missing electrical outlets) in her own unit. The kitchen and bathroom needed a complete treatment, and the living room and bedroom required diametrically opposed designs: out with chunky built-ins on multiple walls in the living room, and in with a thoughtful and multi-functional built-in for the windowed bedroom wall.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishlist near complete, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claudia decided to post her project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2531" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was matched with a Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who specializes in creating architecture and interior design solutions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon meeting with Frederick and his team, Claudia made an overarching goal clear: She wasn’t interested in solely installing modern finishes over the old. The original bones were just as important as the final coat of paint. That pristine 1929 appeal needed to show through and reveal itself via new design details. With extensive renovations planned in every room, Claudia moved out of the apartment temporarily to allow for Frederick and his crew to get started. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia believed that original parquet floors were hiding underneath all the carpeting, and she was right. Frederick had the wood floors sanded and refinished, bringing them back to life without introducing any new materials. With extra sheetrock walls encroaching in multiple directions, the team chipped away at the wall of boxed windows, disposing of an 18 inch layer of brick and wood. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avert your eyes if you live in a typical NYC co-op, because you will probably NEVER experience this, but somehow Claudia nearly doubled the size of her living room windows by combining them, flooding the space with lovely natural light. All of the windows were replaced with double-paned versions, up to code with the building and boasting the required heat, freeze and UV protections. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the opposite end of the room, the crew stripped away the ever-so-slightly-asymmetrical built-in shelving and cabinetry to reveal an open, wood-burning hearth. Claudia turned to a local Italian couple who specialize in old world mantels for an understated limestone facade, and Frederick brought in a specialist to design and install crown moldings along the doorways, windows, ceiling and floor boards throughout the apartment. Claudia’s mother helped source the final touch: an accent wall in a serene, neutral palette is an elegant and stylish addition to an inviting new living room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the kitchen, Claudia knew she wanted a white kitchen and was unsentimental about getting rid of the “horrible” gray linoleum floors. Cosmetic features aside, she wanted more storage space and a way to install an exhaust fan over a new cooktop. In an attempt to carve out some casual eating space, the previous owners had put some very limited cabinetry along the left-side of the galley, and appliances took up most of the storage and prep space on the right side.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claudia chose a small pearlescent stone tile in a melange of pebble hues to take the place of the severely dated synthetic floor she’d grown to detest. High-impact cabinet changes were custom fit into the small space. Claudia worked with an Italian purveyor specializing in hidden compartments for the fridge and hood, and managed to conceal all of the major stainless steel appliances except for the striking new Bertazzoni range, because, Bertazzoni! The laminate countertops were removed and replaced with a white Caesarstone slab and corresponding backsplash, and an undermount stainless sink&#8211;supplied by the same producer as the cabinets&#8211;was installed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18452 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="white Caesarstone countertop" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18453 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18454 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="stainless undermount sink" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18455" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-08-10.gif" alt="Bertazzoni range" width="600" height="797" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia knew she didn’t need to change the footprint of her bathroom to incorporate the many features she wanted here. The tub needed two shower curtains to keep water in, the full surround of blue-gray tile muted natural light, and the bulky vanity was topped with a throwback plastic ball faucet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia went with a floor tile pick that is complementary but different to those used in the kitchen, and with Frederick’s help, incorporated extra pieces into a design detail border along the wall of freshly installed white subway tiles. The tub came out and was replaced with a slightly larger and more modern German piece to coincide with new spa accessories: a rainwater shower head plus a handheld option for added luxe. The fixed shower rod was taken down to make way for a glass partition and hinged glass door that swings out for maximum function and style. Claudia chose a pedestal sink for extra floor and knee space, opting to place storage behind hidden cabinets in the wall instead. Almost all of the bathroom features were handpicked from local design shop Elegance in Hardware, including the polished nickel door knobs, which are exclusive to the outlet.  </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bedroom, Claudia and her design-build team pursued the opposite approach. Instead of doing away with built-ins, they found areas where custom additions would have a meaningful impact on space use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They added a custom closet in the hallway, outfitted  by California Closets, just outside the bath before entering the living room and introduced this same custom storage concept in the bedroom, behind a mirrored closet wall—one of the only major features that remained. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the carpet was torn out in the bedroom, Claudia approached Frederick with her hopes of incorporating a window seat before new wall treatment and molding went in. The designer re-enlisted his subcontractor to fashion a custom wooden seat built right into the new shelving set. The homeowner would just need an upholstered cushion and good book to make it complete.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia revealed to us that upon visiting her apartment, after the renovations were complete and the dust had nearly cleared, she stood and looked around the empty rooms and was filled with the sense that nothing had changed. It was as if she were apartment shopping in 1929, which, she explained, is exactly what she wanted.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, we’re off to Chelsea to tour an apartment rescued from someone else’s well-intentioned (but ultimately not long-lasting) DIY tile project. Cara, Jared, and their dog, Indy, moved into their one bedroom, one bathroom co-op a few years ago, and though Cara was irked by the kitchen’s layout and finishes from the beginning, the couple arrived at a point of no return last year when the mosaic tile installed by the previous owners started to fall off the wall.</p>
<p><a href=" https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-cara-and-jareds-chelsea-kitchen-and-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14393 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/carakbathreno-2.jpg" alt="chelsea kitchen reno" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/carakbathreno-2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/carakbathreno-2-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>“Evros was able to come in, be a calming influence at a stressful time, and meet deadlines from our board and our cabinet vendor. He’ll be back to help get our place ready for the arrival of our new baby!”</strong></em><span id="more-14284"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em><strong>&#8212; Cara and Jared, Chelsea homeowners</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the bathroom situation was the most dire – tile damage near the tub was more than just a cosmetic concern – the kitchen was also turning out to be too cramped for two cooks. Jared, a professional chef, and Cara, who works for a boutique recruiting firm, decided to press on with targeted changes to make the space more of a fit for them. After a first try with a contractor they found through a friend who wasn’t able to get buy-in from the building’s board, the couple came to Sweeten to find a team who could handle <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their project</a> and make sure that each “t” and every “i” would be properly crossed and dotted for building approval. We introduced Cara and Jared to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Evros</a> who gracefully took on both charges.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14351 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-022.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="803" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-022.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-022-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14472 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-013.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="803" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-013.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-013-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cara and Jared decided early on to focus a significant chunk of their budget on built-to-order kitchen cabinetry from <a href="https://henrybuilt.com/page/henrybuilt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henrybuilt</a>. They nearly tripled the kitchen’s storage by removing a partial peninsula, lengthening the counter and shelving line way out of the corner, and adding a hefty island with a huge amount of storage and prep space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new white oak cabinetry is beautifully crafted and helped dictate design and finish decisions throughout the room. The couple picked a gray plank base with a white oak line of upper cabinets. Aside from their neutral and contemporary appeal, Cara explained that Henrybuilt offers a mix and match option (high-pressure laminate along the bottom and solid wood on top) that gave them the effect of high-end cabinetry without quite having to shoulder the full cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other key design decision involved moving the stove out of the back of the room and centering it – better for hosting and better for access to the dining area.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Evros’s team anchored the expanded kitchen footprint with porcelain tiles from <a href="https://www.porcelanosa-usa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porcelanosa</a> and installed <a href="https://pentalquartz.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pentalquartz</a> counters all they way around the new line of base cabinets. Cara artfully explained that her talented husband has some, well… bull-in-china-shop tendencies when he is at work on a new culinary treat, and so their sole consideration in choosing a new counter was durability and stain resistance! The “bar block” that tops the island is a Henrybuilt signature – Cara and Jared love the accessible storage option and layered it with glass to make it easier to use in a high-traffic entryway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cara chose the neutral white backsplash tile from <a href="https://www.nemotile.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nemo Tile</a> for its modern simplicity and understated effect. Finishing strong with appliances, Cara and Jared headed for a big, beautiful 36” <a href="https://us.bertazzoni.com/products/ranges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bertazzoni range</a>, a <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch dishwasher</a> concealed with a custom door panel, and a <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung fridge</a> that hides Cara’s most favorite new feature: a built-in <a href="https://sodastream.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SodaStream</a> faucet (this exists?!).</p>

<p>In the bathroom, Evros and his team took on a surgical task to take the old tub out, create a walk-in shower, and replace the crumbling tile that had served as the impetus for the entire project. Cara and Jared decided to leave as much intact as possible and work with what they had, so Evros made sure that the transition from the gleaming new shower to the rest of the room came off seamlessly. Everyone agreed to just do what was needed to make the necessary fixes and restore balance to the room’s function.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Previous Sweeten renovators return for finishing touches: a fresh kitchen, living room, master bedroom</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/scandi-brooklyn-sweetened-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14499 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marioapt.jpg" alt="clinton hill coops" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marioapt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marioapt-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario, who works in media, and Joe, who works in healthcare, bought their one-bedroom co-op in 2013 and spent a year learning their way around its many nooks and crannies. The original space had lots of doors and walls that kept the kitchen and pantry closed off from the living and dining rooms, blocking windows and hiding just how much square footage was actually in play. Mario geared up for a full renovation that would bring walls down and open the space up, and Joe plotted the demise of the apartment’s dark parquet floors. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten general contractor</a> to execute on their vision.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14486" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-02" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-02-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14485" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-01.jpg" alt="clinton hill coop" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-01-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting in the kitchen, their contractor demo&#8217;ed walls to let light in from this apartment’s signature corner windows. They couldn’t move a structural column so it became the visual marker for the new kitchen’s expanded lines. Maybe surprisingly, they brought down the kitchen ceiling a few inches to make room for recessed lighting and to demarcate the newly open spaces – raising the ceiling seems to be the goal in many renovations, but you can see where a few inches of lost height made complete sense here. Mario and Joe chose <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/kitchen-cabinets-fronts-24254/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA’s now-classic white lacquer cabinetry</a> and sourced contemporary cabinet pulls from <a href="https://cabinetparts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinetparts.com</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14495" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-14.jpg" alt="clinton hill coop" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-14.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-14-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14494" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-13.jpg" alt="clinton hill coop" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-13.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-13-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their contractor helped design the new kitchen island to allow access from both sides. The island is unusually large and far from the kitchen wall, but with drawers on both sides (plus a <a href="https://www.goedekers.com/Summit-CL24WC2.html?utm_source=Amazon&amp;utm_medium=cse&amp;utm_campaign=CL24WC2&amp;zmam=34103103&amp;zmas=2&amp;zmac=231&amp;zmap=Summit-CL24WC2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Summit wine fridge</a>), it manages to be kitchen-focused on one end with a great work-space option on the other. Mario and Joe decided to keep all of the appliances in a row along the kitchen’s back wall with an all-star line-up that includes a <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com/cgi-bin/ajmadison/MAS304GASXE.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bertazzoni range</a>, a stainless steel <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/productslist/home-appliances/SHX65T55UC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch dishwasher</a>, and a slim <a href="https://www.us-appliance.com/rf135bdlux1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel fridge</a> with bottom freezer. The backsplash was an admitted splurge – Mario and Joe fell for an <a href="https://www.annsacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ann Sacks tile</a> with an architectural feel and a subtle matte finish. From the living room it disappears, but in the kitchen, the raised detail is super gorgeous.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14498" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-17.jpg" alt="clinton hill coop" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-17.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-17-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14496" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-15.jpg" alt="clinton hill coop" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-15.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-15-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the apartment, Mario and Joe replaced dark parquet tiles with wide-plank, 7 1/2“ matte-finished oak floors. They chose the starkest white wall color they could find to keep the main space modern (they actually chose <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/redirects/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=linenwhite&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Moore’s Linen White</a>, which has a very white feel in their place despite a name that suggests creamy undertones). The contractor updated baseboard molding with square trim, added low-rise built-in <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/living-room-storage-system-29882/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA cabinets</a> as a media center in the living room, stacked floating shelves in the master bedroom, and brought in extra help to overhaul the apartment’s big closets.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario and Joe’s style sensibility works so well in the new layout. Somehow, they appear to have already owned most of the art and furniture pieces that look tailor-made in here. Mario explained that the trick was in figuring out where to place furniture and art after walls came down and left fewer surfaces for hanging pieces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A decor round-up is in order: the kitchen counter stools, couch, and coffee table are all from <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West Elm</a>, the dining table is from <a href="https://www.cb2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CB2</a>, and the geometric red rug is a <a href="https://www.crateandbarrel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crate &amp; Barrel</a> pick. Sadly, the cowhide rug was a wanderlust find in Chile and the retro print hanging above the bed is from a DC market, so you can’t have either, but there is a lot here that anyone could work with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And in case you missed it, the couple also gutted their bathroom. More on that shimmery tile right <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Last week <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/site-visit-billy-sallys-diy-project-begins-w-thesweeten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we introduced you</a> to a Brooklyn-based couple who have just completed the renovation of their 775 sqft Fort Greene flat: Billy, a freelance web developer (currently at <a href="https://www.paddle8.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paddle8</a>), and Sally, a <a href="https://www.sallypaul.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painter</a> and museum educator at MoMA, ICP and the American Museum of Folk Art. Billy &amp; Sally&#8217;s project got started on Sweeten with preliminary construction work by Sweeten member <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ecostruct llc</a>, and subsequently finished up with a full kitchen update and flooring replacement carried out by Billy &amp; Sally themselves (&#8211;some of which is also documented <a href="https://billyfowks.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> on Billy&#8217;s renovation blog). The couple, along with their kitty, Lil&#8217; Miss, recently invited us back to show off the gorgeous results. Their new space is cozy &amp; bright, and, after being put to the test over the holidays, is also a perfect venue for cooking &amp; entertaining!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6587 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/00_theSweeten_billyandsally02.png" alt="stylishly-curated-home-renovation-brooklyn" width="560" height="392" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/00_theSweeten_billyandsally02.png 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/00_theSweeten_billyandsally02-300x210.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />Here is what the apartment looked like just before Billy &amp; Sally moved in. Throughout the apartment the parquet floors were badly worn and the ceilings showed significant water damage. The kitchen, which was tucked away in a maze of walls, was a tight &amp; dreadfully generic space.</p>

Here in the entry we have our first glimpse of the new flooring and the open kitchen. <img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinet-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38588 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and black countertop and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Billy &amp; Sally selected a light and modern-looking floor surface of engineered hickory that could actually be installed on top of the existing parquet floors (more on the install <a href="https://billyfowks.com/blog/2012/09/05/flooring-install-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). So, leaving the old parquet surface intact, they removed only the small area of kitchen tiles and replaced them with a layer of sub-flooring before finally working their way through the entire apartment with <a href="https://www.lumberliquidators.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the new hickory boards</a>. <img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinet-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38589 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and black countertop and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />In the kitchen, ikea cabinets with <a href="https://www.berensonhardware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berenson pulls</a> look clean &amp; modern, and since they&#8217;re more budget-friendly than custom cabinets, the duo was able to splurge on well-designed appliances. We especially love their new Bertazzoni range (available online <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). Other new additions include a refrigerator by <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel</a> and a sleek dishwasher by <a href="https://www.blombergappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blomberg</a>. <img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinet-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38590 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with black countertop and undermount stainless steel sink and faucet after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Similar to the cabinets, the new kitchen <a href="https://www.ikea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sink</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faucet</a> are also from ikea. <img decoding="async" title="small-open-kitchen-and-dining" class="wp-image-38591 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-723x1044.jpg" alt="small open kitchen with floating shelves and peninsula island and dining space after renovation" width="723" height="1044" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-723x1044.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-208x300.jpg 208w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-600x867.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Above the new kitchen island, the couple chose a pair of all-white pendants which were purchased on ebay.  The open shelving in the far corner is made from ikea <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NUMERAR</a> countertops that were cut to fit and mounted on elfa brackets (available at <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/welcome.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Container Store</a>). These shelves remind us a lot of <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/site-visit-lucky-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the unit ecostruct built for Amanda</a> last summer. <img decoding="async" title="open-shelves-and-white-kitchen-cabinets" class="wp-image-38592 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets and open shelves and stainless steel appliances and black countertop after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />One of Billy &amp; Sally&#8217;s favorite new features &#8211;and another worthwhile splurge&#8211; are their lovingly-polished <a href="https://www.soapstones.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soapstone</a> countertops. <img decoding="async" title="peninsula-kitchen-island-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38593 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="peninsula kitche island with black countertop and pendant light and hardwood floors after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Looking back into the living area, it&#8217;s clear that cooking is now a social activity rather than a private one. <img decoding="async" title="floating-book-shelves-in-living-room" class="wp-image-38594 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="floating book shelves on white wall in living room with hardwood floors after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />More open shelving in the living space makes for lovely &amp; efficient storage, as well as a nice display alongside the couple&#8217;s unique art collection. Best of all, the repeated shelving details weave this space together with the kitchen.</p>
<p>BIG thanks to Billy &amp; Sally for sharing their beautiful renovation!</p>
