<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Bathroom remodel “must-haves”</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Our home is a wood-frame row house in Jersey City, New Jersey. It’s 150 years old, has three floors, and 1,000 square feet. </span><span class="s1">When we first visited the house more than five years ago, I fell in love with the main bathroom’s vintage mint-green bathtub. I knew I wanted to preserve it. </span></p>
<div>

</div>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our home is historic, but over the years and through many renovations, most of its charm had been lost. T</span><span class="s2">he house’s two bathrooms are “newer”—added at some point onto the back of the house. The one we wanted to update is on the second floor, off of the primary bedroom. </span><span class="s1">It’s our only full bathroom. </span><span class="s3">We didn’t want to change the floor plan, but had a goal of</span><span class="s1"> modernizing while injecting a vintage feel. We planned to do this by</span><span class="s3"> keeping the original tub and adding a period medicine cabinet we’d found. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our second goal was to make the room warmer. We suspected it wasn’t properly insulated because it got so cold in winter</span><span class="s3">. </span><span class="s1">We’d lived in this house for five long winters, but there was never a good time to improve on it.</span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Staying home during the remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">We embarked on the bathroom renovation last summer. Our household—two adults and two cats—had</span><span class="s1"> been working from home since the pandemic began in March 2020. My partner and I are handy and we’ve done many projects ourselves, including tile work, sheetrock, trim, carpentry, and minor plumbing and electrical work. We have a good sense of how things should be done, but we didn’t have the personal bandwidth <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/diy-vs-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to complete this project ourselves</a>. Luckily, the lockdown gave us the flexibility to have our only full bathroom out of commission. We would not have a shower during the bathroom renovation, but we had a backyard with a hose! </span><span class="s4">We would prioritize our bathtub and shower update, then move to the rest of the bathroom. </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Style sparks inspiration for the vintage bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> post, we mentioned the mint-green bathtub and our desire to work with it. We wanted the tub to feel intentional in the space, rather than something that was left there because it was too heavy or too expensive to get rid of. To make the room feel more “classic,” we wanted to introduce vintage elements, but merge them with a modern design. Posting our project on Sweeten made it possible for us to “take the plunge.” We were hesitant about hiring a contractor, but Sweeten gave us confidence, knowing we wouldn’t be going it alone.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Improving the bathroom layout</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">As planned, we did not change the bathroom layout, but some demolition discoveries influenced the project. </span><span class="s5">We found remnants of original pastel pink tiles near the tub—but while the color combination was classic in the bathroom’s era, we decided not to go so bold. With</span><span class="s1"> the walls down, we saw that we not only needed additional insulation behind the new sheetrock but in the ceiling as well. We also noticed that the ceiling near the door had been dropped by several feet. Pulling it down and replacing it offered an opportunity to open and visually enlarge the space. This nice surprise changed the whole feeling of the room.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Picking bathroom tiles</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finding modern tiles that seemed true to the historic nature of the house, but that would also play well with the tub, wasn’t easy. Matching tile to vintage mint-green porcelain is impossible, and coordinating colors—other than neutrals—are limited. We’d first selected a different floor tile, also with a green marble effect, but when we tried to order, it was no longer available. We’d already chosen a project start date so we scrambled to find a replacement. Fortunately, we found this mosaic polished stone tile. It was <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-much-does-it-cost-to-tile-a-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more expensive than our original pick</a>, which gave us pause, but we needed to move forward. I love how it complements the tub.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor used inspirational photos and sketched the design for the inlaid black pencil tile. He then executed it beautifully and it came out exactly as we’d hoped. The white wall tile has a vintage vibe but is simpler, allowing the tub and floor tile to shine.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Design ideas: old and new</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We chose this vanity in part because it was larger than our prior one, and has drawers. Our little old house is tight on storage, so it was important to maximize the vanity’s potential. I like the legs—it resembles furniture and lets the floor tiles show. We’d come across t</span><span class="s6">he </span><span class="s1">chrome medicine cabinet with lights at an antique shop and saved it until we were ready to start. Its curves are wonderful, as are the inner glass shelves, which are still intact. The mirror’s silvering has imperfections, but that adds to the charm.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My favorite aspects of the vintage (but still modern!) bathroom remodel are the high ceiling and floor tile. I had been planning the renovation for several years, and during that time I had collected probably 15 different floor- and wall-tile combinations. Ultimately, I was glad we took a few years to decide what we wanted and to find the right pieces. And I still love the green tub.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/64811-Sarah-Bath-06.jpg" alt="White toilet with art deco floor tiling" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52033" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/64811-Sarah-Bath-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/64811-Sarah-Bath-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/64811-Sarah-Bath-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Working with the right renovation partner</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From the very beginning, our Sweeten contractor responded to the issues and questions we raised and collaborated with us in the design process. He helped us plan out what materials we needed and told us when we would need them, helping us to avoid scrambles and delays. It never felt like our input was creating a problem, or that we were being ignored.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There was no avoiding the fact that we were living in a tiny construction zone but our contractor and his crew made it as painless as possible. It was great to see the time and effort they put into clean-up each day. We’re both extremely happy with the end result.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These homes were stuck in the past until a (long overdue!) home renovation brought each one back to the future</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners who are feeling ambitious and want to take on a home that hasn’t been changed in decades have a unique opportunity. In an older home that’s been given new life, updated features sit alongside quirky and charming details from the past, such as crown molding and arched doorways. This kind of home renovation where the marriage of old meets new provides all the benefits of a modern space while retaining the character that can only come from a place that has a history. Below, three Sweeten homeowners take on the challenge of revamping older homes—and the results are truly magical.</p>

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank">Meredith’s townhouse</a>, built in 1941</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meredith set out to find a fixer-upper and fell in love with a two-family brick Tudor townhouse in Kensington that only had one owner since 1941. With good bones and plenty of personality in the form of arched doorways and a 1950s Caloric stove, the home had potential, but it also required intensive repairs. Lead paint, cloth-wrapped aluminum <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-electrical-work-costs/" target="_blank">electrical wiring</a>, and old steel windows all had to go. Meredith found a contractor on Sweeten and started her renovation, focusing on maintaining some of the ‘40s charm while making necessary functional updates. A new kitchen was designed around the old stove, and in keeping with the theme of nostalgia, Meredith installed a salvaged Sub-Zero fridge and vintage enamel sink. The Pepto-Bismol pink bathrooms were redone in a much more tasteful palette of muted blues and received all new fixtures. Upstairs, the renovation included converting the second kitchen into a master bath, building a nursery, and updating the master bedroom and closet. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the rest of this lovely townhouse.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ron lived in his Upper East Side postwar apartment for 40 years before making the decision to renovate. He worked closely with his interior designer, who came to Sweeten to find a contractor to complete their team. The plan consisted of a total gut renovation of the kitchen as well as painting the apartment, stripping and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank">refinishing floors</a>, cleaning up the crown molding in the living room, and adding custom millwork to hide old radiator units. He decided against joining the kitchen and living room and instead chose to keep the kitchen enclosed and add finishes that would make it feel larger and brighter. With all new appliances from Thermador, including a refrigerator<strong>, </strong>gas range, hood, and dishwasher, the kitchen got the functional upgrade it desperately needed. Architectural details in the kitchen mixed well with traditional <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank">custom cabinets</a> and beveled countertops for a refreshed yet classic style. In the living room, custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank">built-ins</a> with ample shelving were built to show off Ron’s collection of art and treasures from around the world. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the rest of Ron’s home, including his updated bedroom and bath.</p>

</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years after moving into her Upper East Side apartment, Claudia felt ready to renovate. It had been three decades since the apartment’s last home renovation, which had brought with it dated finishes, carpeting, and boxy built-ins. Claudia wanted to highlight the original bones of the home that had been covered up, reclaim some of the square footage lost to the old built-ins, and install some much-needed electrical outlets. She also ripped up the 30-year-old carpeting, uncovering original parquet floors. The windows in the living room were combined, allowing the space to become flooded with natural light, and the built-in surrounding the fireplace was demolished, revealing a wood-burning hearth. Crown molding was designed and placed along doorways, windows, ceilings, and floors to evoke some of the lost 1920s charm. To brighten up her home, the walls of the apartment were <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank">painted</a> white, replacing the dark green shade that had ruled the living room for decades. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see her updated kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An awkward space turns sanctuary with a few simple ideas</h2>
<p>When a long apartment search finally ended, Victoria’s Secret designer Christine Yao returned to one of the first listings already crossed off her list. It was the one she ultimately closed on, and she was happy with her new home—except for her bathroom which felt like showering in a dark closet. An internet search led her to Sweeten and a match with a general contractor, who would help transform the space to echo the layout and feel of the baths she&#8217;d been pinning on Pinterest for months. With smart space reconfigurations (including a vintage sliding door) and good project management, he made it happen. In her own words, Christine tells the story, from how the thought of renovating scared her to the completion of her relaxing new dwelling.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21669 size-large" title="fashion designer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-600x900.jpg" alt="White bedroom" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><em>Guest post by East Village homeowner Christine Yao</em></p>
<p>I had been living on the Lower East Side for about five years when I started looking for a place to own. My weekends became a routine, waking up and planning errands around my StreetEasy open house schedule and any listings my real estate agent sent me. The beginning was packed, usually a few on Saturday and also Sundays when I walked all over downtown and viewed up to six apartments. You quickly realize that when you are focused on staying in a specific area—for me that was roughly LES/Chinatown/East Village—there are a limited number of places to see. At first, it seemed like there were hundreds of apartments for sale, and maybe 50 you can afford. You feel like half of the 50 may not even be worth seeing from the photos but you go see them anyway. A friend who had gone through the home-buying process made a comparison to online dating—one can only tell so much from the photos, you just have to go and see it in person to really know! A few months in, I had lost out on two places, and felt a little hopeless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #a69f3d;"><em><strong>&#8220;No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?&#8221;</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, finally, six months after I started looking, I had an accepted offer and closed on a co-op in the East Village. I had actually seen this apartment at the very beginnings of my search. My brother was in town on a Sunday when I dragged him from one open house to another. We thought the apartment was in an awesome location, and was a nice size. It needed some cosmetic work, but both agreed the bathroom was terrible. It had a wall right in the middle of it with the bathtub half concealed, so it felt like you were showering in a dark closet. It was cramped, with an awkward layout, and was just in bad shape. So I crossed it off the list. The idea of a bathroom renovation was overwhelming to me, on top of buying my first home. Then six months of searching made me re-think—maybe I could. No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21673 size-large" title="bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>So now, I had a bathroom to renovate, a living space that needed a refresh, and no idea where to start. The internet brought me to Sweeten. I liked how simple and straightforward it made finding a contractor: you <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project</a> and general contractors are matched for your job. I decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>—his work was most similar to the aesthetic I was going for and he had completed a project on Sweeten with a great review.</p>
<p>My plan for the entire apartment’s look was minimalist. I love a clean space that still feels warm and cozy. Greek cave hotels and Moroccan riads are a big inspiration for me. I did have a vision of wanting the apartment to feel like a vacation&#8230;somewhere tropical and feels relaxing when you are there. The kitchen, main living area, and two bedrooms just needed a redesign. But I couldn’t imagine my day-to-day in the previous bathroom—the door opening awkwardly, the dark shower, and not being able to enjoy a bath.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21714" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02 (1)" width="600" height="900" /></p>
<p>I was hoping the middle wall obstruction could be partially removed but we wouldn’t know if it was structural until the demo. Turns out the wall had all the building plumbing running through it, so needless to say, it had to stay. However, we found serious leaks happening on the floors above and below me (I am on the third floor of a five-story building), which the building would have to fix before we could move forward. Since pipes had to be replaced, the plumbing could be re-routed, allowing us to swap tub and toilet positioning. This worked out for the best: the toilet in a “nook,” and the bathtub by the window.</p>
<p>I had so many images on my desktop saved for ideas and realized they all had the common thread of black tile floors and clean, white walls with modern fixtures. I was getting a lot of inspiration from restaurant and hotel restrooms. I definitely wanted recessed lighting above the toilet (dimmers are a must for all lighting—mood!) and exposed plumbing under the sink for more leg room.</p>
<p>I ended up ordering almost everything on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>, which has phenomenal customer service by the way. I must have looked at hundreds of sinks. We realized it had to be a corner sink or you wouldn’t have enough space to get on and off the toilet. Then the toilet had to be an appropriate size. Measured twice, measure one more time, then cross my fingers when it came in. It all fit into this Tetris game of a bathroom! I wanted a sliding door that would let light through and found an old office door at Big Reuse in Gowanus, Brooklyn. My contractor cut it down to fit the doorway and painted it.</p>

<p>The renovation was running a couple months late due to waiting on permits, so taking things like a toilet and subway tile from Home Depot that were in stock was a priority. My Sweeten contractor was so easy to work with and made things stress-free on everything from dealing with the unexpected delays and permits to coordinating a time to receive a bathtub delivery. I also trusted his aesthetic and opinion on any design or materials questions I had.</p>
<p>As far as the rest of the apartment, it’s amazing what fresh paint and swapping out things like lighting, doorknobs, and some cabinet doors can do. He did a fantastic painting job and the white floors are my favorite feature of my home. My original budget was $25,000 for renovating the bathroom and repainting the apartment. I ended up going $4,500 overbudget because I live in a co-op. The process of getting permits and running into unforeseen issues with plumbing in-between the floors increased the costs and timeline. A six-week planned renovation turned into three months. I think it was really just me underestimating the cost of labor and materials, especially living here in New York City.</p>

<p>The bathroom turned out better than I could have hoped and I am so thankful for the successful renovation I had with my contractor through Sweeten. Now that I’ve experienced the process, the advice I can offer is to be prepared for it to take longer than you think. And add another month. Be prepared to spend a good chunk of time every day on it—coordinating with your contractor, arranging delivery times, looking for fixtures, going to check on things, etc. Be ready to laugh when things go wrong. And go wrong again. It’ll be worth it when you are enjoying your renovated place, I promise.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot about the kitchen—with all of my budget going to the bathroom and painting, I just took down the cabinet doors myself and painted. That’s a move I’ve done in many apartments I’ve lived in as a renter. It’s functional for now but I can’t wait to renovate this space next!</p>
<p>Thank you Christine, for sharing your story as a first-time homeowner and renovator! You proved that a few renovating ideas can make a big impact, and we love your fresh style.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">This is certainly one of those renovations that I have been anticipating with bated breath. Partly because the amazing homeowners, Kyle, an IT professional at a law firm, and Angela, a freelance illustrator, have the style and the je ne sais quoi to totally charm; but also, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I love projects like this one</a>, where the homeowners have lived in the space, dreamed about what it will be one day, and saved up for years towards the goal of making that dream home their real home. It gives all of us who may still be far from that goal, a sense of possibility.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brooklyn-apartment-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10714 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/01B_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="515" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/01B_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/01B_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x258.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;We&#8217;d been living here for eleven years and things were starting to get a bit shabby. When we moved in, the apartment had been freshly renovated with all the cheapest materials available at Home Depot, which was fine back then, but we really wanted to make it &#8216;ours.&#8217; We saved up for renovations all the while and put a lot of thought into what we wanted to do.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;"> &#8211;Angela, homeowner</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">When the time had arrived early this year, Kyle and Angela (and their &#8220;mean, little chihuahua&#8221;) posted to Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to get started on renovating</a> their 900 sq/ft, 2 bedroom Clinton Hill co-op apartment. The road to selecting &#8216;the perfect contractor&#8217; was made a whole lot sweeter by our three suggestions; according to Angela, “we feel confident that any of the contractors Sweeten selected for us would have done a great job, but we&#8217;re really happy that we chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Kris</a>.&#8221; Kris and his team were able to take the homeowners&#8217; dreams of extra counter space for baking and a place that showed off their personal mid-century style, and turn them into a reality, on-time and within-budget!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10715 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/02_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/02_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/02_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10716 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/03_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/03_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/03_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10717 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/04_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/04_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/04_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Kris&#8217; team worked closely with Kyle and Angela to meet their main objectives for the project: to create a modern, open apartment AND stay on budget. First order of business was making the &#8216;big moves,&#8217; which meant tearing down the non-structural interior walls and tearing up the outdated and damaged parquet flooring. With just these changes, the homeowners could already begin to anticipate their moment of, “I can hardly believe it&#8217;s the same place we&#8217;ve lived for the past decade!”<span id="more-10713"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10718 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/05_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/05_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/05_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10719 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/06_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/06_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/06_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10720 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/07_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/07_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/07_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">What I love about Kris and his team is that, not only are they exceptional at getting the work done well and on-time, but their custom millwork is always so impressive! They worked with Kyle and Angela&#8217;s mid-century modern aesthetic and came up with this gorgeous walnut custom cabinet system that I assure you will never wear out, but only wear in, as this lucky couple grows into their space. For their backsplash, the homeowners went bold with a bright green mosaic tile, <a href="https://www.mosaichse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R&#8217;ceef 5 in lime green</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Along with opening the kitchen came operation living-room-update-and-integrate. This meant that although that rich orangey/yellowish wall color is one of beauty, it needed to be refreshed and made more current with a clean, modern white. Underfoot, the old parquets were replaced throughout with new flooring in unstained white oak.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10721 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10722 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/09_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/09_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/09_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10723 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Although transitioning to a more modern aesthetic, Kyle and Angela wanted to keep a vintage vibe pulsing through their new space. The couple mixed mid-century based furniture, including a set of classic <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eames molded plastic/wire dining chairs</a>, a pair of vintage Heywood-Wakefield side tables, and a period-inspired <a href="https://www.radiusstore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elite Four walnut credenza</a> by Radius Innovative Design, with more current pieces like their <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble and stainless steel portica table</a> from Room &amp; Board.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10724 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">One of the best parts of tracking home renovations is seeing how people choose to highlight the art and objects that make up their personal collection. Throughout Kyle and Angela&#8217;s living area, the couple showcases their very impressive collection of prints by California-based artist, <a href="https://www.shag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shag</a>, and mid-century album covers by illustrator <a href="https://www.jimflora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jim Flora</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10725 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Over the dining table, they were able to bring some of that green from their backsplash out of the kitchen in another retro accent, <a href="https://www.rejuvenation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rejuvenation&#8217;s Astron Tri chandelier</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10727 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Kyle and Angela could not have been more excited to finally be rid of the outdated (Home Depot-centric) bathroom decor that they had come to love to hate (scroll to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see it here</a>), in exchange for their bright new, modern and material-rich space. The deep soaking tub from Kohler is cloaked, like the walls, in super white subway tile, and floating beside it is a dark oak Fresca Vanity with Versa faucet, both from <a href="https://www.decorplanet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decor Planet</a>. I personally love the texture that the carrera marble tiled floor adds to this sleek space.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10726 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">All in all, this home looks great and I can&#8217;t get enough of the true personality inside. Many thanks and congrats to the happy homeowners, Angela and Kyle! Also, big thanks to Sweeten Expert Kris, Natalia, and the rest of the team for the excellent work in making this home a whole lot sweeter!</p>
