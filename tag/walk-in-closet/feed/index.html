										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How to maximize space at home: use transom windows, pocket doors, custom walls and more</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Open floor plans are all the rage—so much so that the first temptation of a renovating homeowner may be to tear down walls. But before you bring in the wrecking ball, consider if you&#8217;ll have enough personal space for your family (or frequent overnight guests), and how a strategically placed wall or partition can maximize your space at home while defining the private areas of your home. Take cues from these Sweeten homeowners and their clever uses of space, from carving out niches and capturing square footage in other areas to adding moveable partitions for smooth transitions.</span></p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-interior-wall-of-windows-brings-light-to-this-guest-alcove/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deeksha and Joe&#8217;s</a> windowed wall and guest bedroom.</p>
<h3>Transom windows allow for a guest bedroom to be added</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an L-shaped living room in their new apartment, Deeksha and Joe saw the opportunity to create a guest bedroom. All they needed to do was add a wall and a doorway. The only problem was that the placement of the wall would block the light and hide a gorgeous view from the corner windows. A unique solution—an interior wall of windows—provides the necessary privacy for the guest bedroom while still allowing the flow of light to reach the rest of the living room. The new space also serves as a light-filled workspace for the family.</p>

<h3>Custom sliding doors to help maximize a 500 square-foot home</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Claire and Dan purchased their 500-square-foot studio apartment, they knew it needed a renovation. The unit hadn’t been updated since the &#8217;60s, and the couple wanted to build out a junior one-bedroom by separating the living/kitchen area from the sleeping space. With DOB regulations preventing permanent wall additions, they worked with their architect and Sweeten general contractor to install custom sliding doors. With the sliding doors, they maximize their space at home by keeping the space open during the day, and closing them for privacy or while entertaining. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44845" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14_compressed.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14_compressed.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14_compressed-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14_compressed-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Strategically removing a hallway adds space (and light!)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long hallway was the main culprit of wasted space in Walter and Laura’s Park Slope apartment. By removing their entry hallway, they imbued their apartment with more natural light</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and space. With the newly-provided footage, their kitchen swapped places with a spare bedroom and got an expanded, angular footprint in the foyer. A small dining/entertaining area was also added to the kitchen, allowing guests to visit with the couple while they cooked. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Adding a wall creates a new bedroom, while transom windows let in soft light</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The notion of adding a dishwasher to their kitchen escalated into a full gut renovation, and then took another, unexpected turn when Chris and Amber found out their second child was on the way. The project was now an opportunity to carve out a room for their older son. A wall was added to separate the dining nook from the rest of the kitchen, turning it into a bedroom, and a milk glass transom window was installed above the doorway to allow light to filter through. Finishing touches; a crib, picture shelves, roller blinds, and a colorful rug complete the transformation from dining nook to a growing boy&#8217;s bedroom.</p>

<h3><strong>A studio morphs into a one-bedroom with the help of a full dividing wall</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New homeowner Paul landed his perfect apartment by getting creative in his search: instead of buying a “true” one-bedroom apartment in Hell’s Kitchen, he purchased a studio that was listed as a junior one bedroom. Paul noticed the apartment’s previous owner was already mimicking a one-bedroom layout by using a built-in bookcase to separate the bedroom and living area. He replicated this layout in his renovation by having this general contractor add a full dividing wall (with a pocket door) to separate his living area from his bedroom. </span></p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frans and Dalal&#8217;s</a> movable partitions and multipurpose spaces.</p>
<h3><strong>Turning a studio into a two-bedroom (yes, really!) with movable partitions </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal planned on making their studio function as a two-bedroom; not an easy feat, considering the apartment’s existing open-plan layout. They added a custom king-size platform bed in the space designated as the master bedroom. The key feature, movable partitions, allow it to work as a space for sleep or as another part of the home. For the &#8220;second bedroom,&#8221; a queen-size Murphy bed that folds up horizontally to save space and a closet were installed in the area designated as the living room, which uses the same sliding doors for privacy. As an added bonus, the wall unit that houses the pull-out bed and closet blends into the surrounding walls when the bed is tucked away.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/millennial-sisters-buy-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deanna and Daria&#8217;s</a> two-bedroom transformation</p>
<h3><strong>Major wall movement reshapes an entire 700 square-foot apartment layout</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn one bedroom into two, create a walk-in closet, and make a dining space fit for hosting: these items topped the to-do list for sisters (and roommates) Deanna and Daria’s renovation in New York’s Sutton Place. To really maximize space at their home, construction moved walls from the existing dining room, living room and bedroom to reshape the new rooms: nearly the entire space of the apartment. Now, their 700 square-foot apartment maximizes every inch of space while showcasing the sisters’ preference for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bold patterns and color. </span></p>

<h3><strong>To maximize space at home for a new baby, walls &amp; a doorway create a nursery </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to make their one-bedroom apartment family-ready, Karen and Kevin set their sights on converting a dining nook situated at the tail end of the kitchen into a nursery for their daughter. They added a new wall and doorway, which allows  for entry from the main living area. The new nursery, now completely separate from the kitchen, receives a flood of sunlight during the day, an added benefit from the window it inherited from the former dining area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sliding-Doors-No-Watermark.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="living-room-with-floating-book-shelves"  class="alignnone wp-image-38800 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-25.jpg" alt="living room with floating book shelves and sliding doors and hardwood floors after renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-25.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-25-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-25-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />

<h3><strong>A retractable partition create privacy for parents and children in a one-bedroom</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A one-bedroom in a coveted neighborhood inspired Casey and Kumar to maximize space at home for their four-person family. After examining their family’s daily routines, the couple decided to give their sons the master bedroom so that they would have a space for playtime and bedtime. They added a multipurpose space in the living area with a wall of custom millwork and a pull-out bed. This became the space that Casey and Kumar could sleep and store their clothes. To preserve privacy and block light and noise, a retractable partition now divides the designated sleeping space from the rest of the home. The addition of the partition now offers flexibility for the family&#8217;s daily needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23448 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-11" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/lindsay-and-matts-sweetened-brooklyn-coop-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay and Matt&#8217;s</a> nursery.</p>
<h3><strong>Need your one-bedroom to be a two-bedroom? Demo a closet, build a partition, add a door. Voila!</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way, Lindsay and Matt needed to turn their one-bedroom into a two-bedroom apartment. They planned to do this by splitting the existing bedroom into a master bedroom and nursery. A few key layout changes made this all possible: demolishing closets to gain back valuable square footage, building a partition, and creating a doorway that opened into the living room. These newly constructed spaces have allowed the home to reach its full potential by making room for the whole family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;"><i>When designer, Whitney and her fiancé, Laurence, moved into their 1,000-square-foot co-op in Forest Hills, Queens, they were prepared to create a home to accommodate their newlywed lifestyle and different work schedules. First on the list: remedying a series of separate and awkward bedroom closets—one of which was within another closet (!). They sketched a walk-in closet and dressing room with better flow, re-stained their floors to a modern finish, and combined their belongings from their previous places, all with the wedding date fast approaching. They reached out to Sweeten, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and by project end, they loved the results so much, they extended the job and added to their scope.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Guest blog post by Whitney in Forest Hills, Queens</i></p>
<p>We looked at so many apartments. We stopped counting at 50. We felt discouraged after being outbid on two other apartments by all-cash buyers. But we kept coming back to this apartment. It was different than the others. It was spacious and the wide-open views, natural light, and Southern exposure were alluring. We were willing to overlook the years of wear because it had potential. Ultimately, we were seduced by the view of the Manhattan skyline. Having both lived in NYC studios for over 15 years, Laurence in Sunnyside and me on the Upper East Side, the large bedroom was certainly a plus, but the awkward closet layout was cumbersome.</p>
<p>There was a typical small closet with a simple rod and shelf configuration that had a bi-fold door that could only be opened if the bedroom door was in the closed position. A four-door, full-height mirrored built-in unit concealed the door to the small walk-in closet. In effect, there were four separate closets none of which were completely accessible to the other.</p>

<p>This clumsy arrangement did not work for our lifestyle. We have different work schedules—I&#8217;m an interior designer, Laurence is a bartender in Manhattan—and are respectful not to disturb each other in the early morning or late evening. Knocking down the quirky closets to re-create one large dressing room was the best solution.</p>
<p>Careful planning and meticulous measurements of this new space still allowed for two large chests of drawers and a king-size bed in the bedroom without compromise. Our feng shui consultant advised us on our furniture plan, design and artwork placement to bring positive change, harmony and balance into our home. This was our first home together as a married couple and we wanted to honor it with good vibes. Sketched out on paper, we designed a master bedroom that felt grand and spacious. We wanted to get started right away since we had recently combined households, were living in a studio, paying for two overflowing storage units, carrying two mortgages and maintenance bills, and getting married within the month.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Even though I&#8217;m in the design industry, my go-to contacts were booked. I decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5030" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post my project</a> on Sweeten, and was lucky to find <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a> who had the level of workmanship that met my high standards. He was courteous, professional and punctual. On our first meeting, he was in the lobby waiting for our arrival. With our plan and vision, he was right in step as we discussed what was possible within our budget. Reading Sweeten&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovation cost guideline</a> helped us know what to expect and how to budget for the project.</span></p>

<p>In addition to the dressing room, our wish list included refinishing the floors, replacing the baseboard, and painting. We love the basketweave effect of the original parquet floors, but preferred dark wood floors to feel grounded on the 14th floor. Our contractor&#8217;s positive attitude brought forward creative solutions for our scope of work. While it was cost efficient to preserve the floors, he explained that they were very thin and refinishing them was a risky job. Willing to take the risk, we gave him a color wood sample to match.</p>
<p>After demolition, it was evident that some of the flooring could not be salvaged. The exact same parquet floor was sourced to replace areas in the dressing room and elsewhere in the apartment and looks seamless. He also removed a layer of linoleum in the foyer which revealed the original parquet so now the floor runs throughout, making it feel expansive.</p>
<p>Great progress was made in a short amount of time before we left for our honeymoon, and not wanting to break the momentum, our contractor sent us a text shortly on the first morning after we departed for Amagansett. (We appreciated how he staying in communication with us!) The flooring subcontractor had just mixed three custom stain samples on the floor, and they needed an answer immediately. Luckily, one of the samples was spot on, and they went straight to work. Then we received a call the next day to let us know that the floors did not come out to his satisfaction. He was going to redo them at no additional cost to us, but reiterated his concern in sanding the floors again.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22590 size-chrono" title="closet renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>We returned from our honeymoon and to our delight the floors were gorgeous! We were so happy with the walk-in closet that we asked our contractor to transform the linen and coat closets, too. He was great, the initial job came in on budget, and he advised us of the cost of change orders, billing us appropriately for the additional work we requested along the way so there were no financial surprises in the end.</p>
<p>The investment we made in the apartment and the value-added renovation has enhanced our lifestyle. If space is a luxury, a dressing room is the ultimate luxury.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years after Kelly purchased her studio apartment in a lovely Brooklyn Heights co-op, she was ready to take on a major overhaul of the old appliances and cheap cabinets in the kitchen and bath. Unsure of the style she was after, Kelly sought the help of a designer who could run with big transformations to her little abode. Read on for our reveal of Kelly’s sparkling new kitchen, bathroom, and bonus closet renovations!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kellys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-sweeten-brooklyn-heights/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17853" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kelly-kitchen2.jpg" alt="brooklyn heights co-op" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kelly-kitchen2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kelly-kitchen2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-17835"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><i>“Courtney was fantastic! Her process for learning about the project, the space potential, and understanding who I am is her true talent. I always felt that I had a voice and control over the design, which was important to me, but Courtney effortlessly brought it to life.”<br />
</i><i><i></i></i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><i><i>-Kelly, Brooklyn Heights homeowner</i></i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly had come to realize that living in a studio apartment meant that the kitchen would forever be the focal point—it “needed to rock”, as she put it. With old appliances and “cheap” cabinets and counters, the kitchen lacked a ton of functionality. An earlier attempt at open shelving left all sorts of things exposed, the cabinets extended just halfway to the ceiling, bar seating offered zero storage topped with a thin strip of counter prep space, and the stove and fridge were both miniature-sized. Kelly wanted to find an interior designer whose imagination wasn’t limited by tight spaces. She </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched her with Sweeten Expert Courtney</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a pro at bringing ambitious texture and color to spaces large and small. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17851" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Kelly wasn’t yet set on any specific style choices for her kitchen, Courtney was able to provide plenty of inspiration to get the renovation process started. The plans called for a few big fixes: Kelly’s team would extend the kitchen cabinets to ceiling height for more storage and finish the cabinetry with a variety of classic doors and transparent glass panes. The bar counter was significantly enlarged, granting more prep and dining space and doubling the kitchen’s drawer storage. And to accommodate a full-sized stove and fridge, Kelly moved the fridge out of the galley altogether.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly appreciated Courtney’s talent for mixing affordable items with the right amount of higher-end items for a polished look. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previous flooring consisted of brick-colored tiles that dragged the room into darkness. Kelly chose eye-catching cement tiles in a white and soft black mosaic, evoking a sense of Moroccan-inspired decor. Kelly bid adieu to the old, sagging cabinets and selected a dove gray IKEA set for the bottom base with a matte white finish for the uppers, plus elegant chrome hardware for all. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her newly-enlarged bar counter, Courtney helped Kelly pick butcher block for its warmth and price point, offsetting that material with a natural stone for the opposite counter. Ready to pack a lot of texture into the small space, Kelly added another pop of personality with a subway-style backsplash of luminous blue hand-glazed ceramic tiles. This detail, along with new undercabinet lighting was the key to unlocking all of that brightness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rickety oven range was replaced with a sleek stainless stove and Kelly scored a matching microwave stationed directly above it. A new dishwasher now resides where the old fridge once stood, and Kelly had new storage and pantry cabinets constructed along the opposite wall, framing the fridge perfectly. Kelly did away with the harsh ceiling light and opted for low-profile recessed lighting instead, complementing her new space gorgeously.  </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renovation plan grew to include the bathroom as well as the secret to the success of any great NYC studio: a highly organized walk-in closet! Without changing the footprint of the bath, Kelly carried several of the design choices from the kitchen over for continuity and coherence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went with the same marbled stone look for the floors and shower walls while replacing the tub with a new white porcelain upgrade. In other splash-prone areas surrounding the sink and shower, Kelly decided on a pale gray glass tile stacked in clean, contemporary lines. The old vanity was replaced with a dark wood cabinet boasting deep storage drawers and a large rectangular sink basin, crowned with a simple mirror and a soft-glow lighting strip. Two chrome shower heads were installed, one flexible and the other stationary, creating an elegant spa oasis. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last perk of this smart renovation came in the form of customizing the studio’s remaining closet, including shelving, section dividers, and a full-length mirror. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly’s lovely, revamped studio is proof that no space is too small for showcasing personal taste and imagination. We’re thrilled to hear that Courtney’s eye for design and hustle helped Kelly re-create this beautiful space!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1102 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>Since none of the finishes or fixtures in the apartment are worth saving and the layout is somewhat awkward, without a real kitchen or closet space, the best strategy is to gut the interior and begin with a clean slate</p>
<p>The apartment would benefit most from a more open layout, to bring light from the rear windows deeper into the interior.   In addition there are some practical considerations.  There&#8217;s the need for a real kitchen, with adequate counter space and storage. There&#8217;s the need for closet and storage space.  And it&#8217;s best to keep the kitchen and bathroom located where they are, close to the existing plumbing, gas and sewage lines.</p>
<p>The design can go in many different directions, depending on the owner&#8217;s lifestyle and priorities.  Here are some basic ideas:</p>
<p>FOR AN ENTREPENEUR</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1108 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone with her own business, or who sometimes works from home, this scheme builds an 8&#8242;-0&#8243; long work station along the right side of the apartment.  It has a continuous wood work counter, drawers and file cabinets below, and shelving on the wall above.  From here the owner can sit and work without distractions.  When she&#8217;s done, she can clear her things from the counter and the space stays tidy and well-organized, separate from rest of the apartment.</p>
<p>The entire apartment remains open.  At the back is the living and dining area.  At the middle is a bed and a clothing closet.  At the front, near the entry, are a galley kitchen, the bathroom, and linen and coat closets</p>
<p>FOR A FASHIONISTA</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1107 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone who cares deeply about fashion, this scheme has a walk in closet with plenty of room for her to keep her clothing and a place where she can get dressed in the morning.  The closet has racks for garments and shelving for shoes, bags and accessories.  There&#8217;s a window for natural light, and room for a chair and a vanity table or standing mirror too.</p>
<p>The remaining space in back becomes a sleeping alcove. The center of the apartment becomes a living area, with built in bookshelves and cabinets.  At the front, near the entry, are a galley kitchen, the bathroom, and linen and coat closets</p>
<p>FOR A GOURMET</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1109 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone who likes to  cook and entertain, this scheme has a full-size kitchen and a formal dining room.  The double galley kitchen provides plenty of counter and storage space, and room for two or three people to be cooking and prepping at one time.  The dining room is large enough to seat six or eight people.</p>
<p>The back becomes a living area with a fold-out bed.  At the front, near the entry, are the bathroom, a clothes closet and a linen closet.</p>
<p>Any of these layouts could be converted to a proper one-bedroom  by closing off the sleeping area.  This is something that&#8217;s possible but that I would try to work around.  Closing off a bedroom might make the rooms, especially those near the entrance, feel small and dark.</p>
<p>This apartment has a footprint that lends itself to many different layouts.  I&#8217;m very excited to see what choices the owner will make as she sweetens the space!</p>
