<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening a physical brick-and-mortar store is a bold and energizing step. It’s a chance to create a walk-in version of&nbsp;a business you’ve been&nbsp;growing, or&nbsp;a tangible&nbsp;realization of a long-awaited vision to be your own boss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail renovation costs<span>—</span>for, say, a clothing or beauty boutique, yoga studio or art gallery can slide from pricey to economical&#8230;depending on what you want. Chain Store Age’s annual survey of retail build-outs put the average cost at $56.53 per square foot. If you use that formula, then it will cost $280,000 for a 5,000-square-foot store build-out. In another example, an entrepreneur in Austin, Texas, only spent $7,650 on a build-out for Little Green Beans, a children’s consignment store for clothing and toys, according to <a href="https://www.inc.com/articles/201108/business-start-up-costs-retail-store.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inc.</a>&nbsp;(The business owner&#8217;s breakdown of costs were: $4,000 construction to customize the space, $3,500 for shelves, racks, etc., and a mere $150 for a handyman).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t be too overwhelmed by this figure. As the name suggests, the&nbsp;above survey takes into account bigger stores that are more commonly found in malls than a Main Street space in an older building. A simple build-out for a smaller store<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>minor construction, a coat of paint, shelves, and racks<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>can cost under $10,000. It all depends on the scope of work and what finishes you want.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To figure out this wide world of retail build-out budgets for your project, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractors, offers a few areas to consider.<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<h3><strong>Design for a commercial storefront space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you choose to hire a designer or architect (not everyone does), expect that to take 20 percent of your renovation budget, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Carla</a>. That could mean $40,000 in a $200,000 budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail projects can be as small as custom shelving for storing product, using existing electrical wiring, and&nbsp;applying&nbsp;a fresh coat of paint. With a build-out that basic, you might avoid the need for permits, thus eliminating the need for blueprints to be approved by an architect. However, if you’re serious about optimizing the size of your space and carefully planning the customer experience, then it&#8217;s best to bring in the big guns. “What do you want the customers to experience? What do you want them to see when they first walk in?” said Carla. Then there are the more technical design elements like handicap accessibility and whether or not you need a bathroom. These are best handled by an architect.</p>
<h3><strong>Electrical costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Chain Store Age survey put the cost of interior lighting at $3.30 a square foot. As mentioned above, electrical can be kept simple by using existing wiring and even fixtures to keep these costs down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott, another Sweeten contractor</a>, has worked on retail build-outs where electrical has been as low as $10,000 or as high as $100,000. Splurges in lighting often come from a client wanting specific light fixtures that are in line with their brand. Altering the position of each light to highlight store product or fixing up existing, decrepit wiring could increase your budget for electrical. Once you get into more serious work, your project might also require the additional cost of applying for permits that could also delay your timeline, Scott said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And it isn’t just lighting that needs to be considered. If your business has additional power needs, such as a salon or a dog groomer with equipment like hair dryers, it is best to assess what power burden your ideal store location can handle before signing a lease. That way, you can either find another location or factor in an electrical upgrade into your budget if necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cjJnJjIEXOM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40884 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Plumbing costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p>This area of the budget will largely depend on:</p>
<p>A. Is there is a bathroom?</p>
<p>B. If no, then would you like a bathroom?</p>
<p>C. If you have one, will it stay in the same place?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a bathroom, then it is possible to freshen it up with a coat of paint. If there is no bathroom, you should consider if it will help your business and your staff (otherwise they might have to close the store whenever they need to use a restroom). “You want to keep customers in your store rather than give them a reason to leave,” said Scott, on why a bathroom might help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A very basic bathroom could set you back $3,000 to $6,000, according to <a href="https://home.costhelper.com/bathroom-addition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost Helper</a>. It could attract additional costs if the location is far from water and sewage lines and if you need the help from a structural engineer. A plumbing permit will also be needed. Moving a bathroom will gather similar costs with the added line item of demolition. If your business has unique needs like a washing station for a hair salon, that will be another cost to factor in.</p>
<h3><strong>Flooring and ceiling costs&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a retail build-out, flooring on average takes up $2.76 per square foot in a budget and ceilings take $1.81, according to Chain Store Age. If there are no structural issues with the flooring (again, check your lease to ensure the landlord is responsible for these costs), then what you do to the floors will likely just be cosmetic. If that is the case—you&#8217;re re-varnishing existing floors or laying some tiles—then the project likely won’t require a permit, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin,&nbsp;a Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>HVAC costs in commercial spaces</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of either fixing, replacing or installing an HVAC system costs on average about $2.61 per square foot or about $13,000 for a 5,000-square-foot space. Like everything else, this average can swing in either direction based on what you have, what you want, and what you can afford.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One way to avoid this cost entirely is to negotiate a lease that puts the responsibility of the HVAC system onto the landlord, according to Colin. As an alternative, you can volunteer to take care of the HVAC system and request that the landlord give you three months of free rent. If it is a simple step of replacing the air conditioning unit with something modern, it likely won’t require a permit, said Scott.</p>
<h3><strong>Millwork costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On average, retail build-outs spend almost $10 a square foot on display fixtures or millwork, according to the Chain Store Age survey. That’s roughly 20 percent of an average budget. But of course, it all depends on your vision for your store.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three factors that determine how expensive your displays will be are material, quantity, and what space they need to fit into, Scott said. The cost of simple wood from Home Depot will pale in comparison to teak from Brazil. Spaces, especially older ones, can also have quirks in them that need to be incorporated into the design of your shelving. “There can be a lot of bends and cuts that you have to fit the wood to,” said Scott. “That can consume a lot of time and add more to the cost.”</p>
<h3><strong>Paint costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting to the paint stage means you are close to the finish line. Your walls need to be prepared first, which might be your priciest point, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Another element that will affect your paint budget is if the color is flat, which is generally a better value than a semi-gloss. Also, the darker the color, the more coats of paint you will need, Bill said.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Real-world retail example</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To put things in perspective, here is an actual retail renovation budget for a New York beauty salon from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Paul</a>:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Commercial_reno_budget_retail.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26944 mb-0 size-chrono" title="actual NYC beauty salon renovation estimate / 1,130 sq ft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Commercial_reno_budget_retail-723x533.jpg" alt="retail renovation cost" width="723" height="533"></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening a physical store is an exciting moment for a business. Whether it&#8217;s a simple build-out or one with more moving parts, there&#8217;s a path for you to bring your storefront into the spotlight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">—</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_7271-e1500769492943.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28363 size-chrono" title="restaurant renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-renovations-chikarashi-restaurant-nomad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chikarashi renovation</a> by Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect Steven</a> and Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor Carl</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurant renovation costs are hardly a prix fixe situation; they can vary dramatically based on the project. Is it a turnkey situation, where you’re planning to open up in a former restaurant location that already has a kitchen, gas, and electrical? Or are you starting from scratch? The city you’re in will also impact the cost, as will the quality of the finishes and the other professionals you hire for your team. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractor, offers some categories to account for and tips on how to draw up an initial budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.buildingjournal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building Journal</a> puts the national average cost for a 5,000-square-foot restaurant with mid-level finishes at $160 a square foot, or $480,000. This can include the build-out, permits, equipment, and design. That cost is higher if you’re based in an expensive city such as New York ($216 per square foot) or Philadelphia ($180 per square foot). &#8220;We tell chefs in NYC who are typically looking at a 2,000-2,500 sq/ft space for a 50-80 seat restaurant that costs can range from $300-350 per square foot for the front of house and $200 per square foot for the back of house,&#8221; says Jonathan Garnett, the creative director at architectural firm MNDPC. &#8220;Multiply that by the 2,000-square-foot space and you have a ballpark.&#8221; Note that this scope does not include furniture, fixtures or restaurant equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What your food and beverage establishment will cost is unclear until you sit down to develop a budget. Here are elements to seriously consider when pulling together an initial budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46400" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png" alt="find general contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Design for a Restaurant Renovation</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For some, starting a restaurant is a creative endeavor, so they prefer to work closely with their general contractor, architect or designer on the design. Some smaller projects like a cafe might not warrant hiring a restaurant designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s a huge range: Those looking to bring in a designer could pay as little as $25,000 or as much as $400,000 and beyond, according to Jimmy Haber, from <a href="https://e2hospitality.com/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESquared Hospitality</a>, which has a long list of successful restaurant ventures all over the world. <span class="s1">The cost depends on the “celebrity” quotient of the designer, whether the space requires a lot of alterations in order to implement a certain design, or </span><span class="s1">how elaborate the decor will be. </span>A restaurant designer won’t just help with the look and feel of the place, but also the all-important layout. The layout will greatly impact the flow of service from kitchen to patron and your staff’s ability to do their job during busy moments. Bringing in an architect early on in the process will provide cost-effective expertise from start to finish, saving time and headache. Basic services include drawing up schematics and submitting the Certificate of Occupancy, but a full-service architect can provide guidance from project management to various levels of interior design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A designer&#8217;s expertise could also increase the number of seats in the establishment, increasing income in the long run. “By the time you construct and open your restaurant, the mistakes are already there and it is too late,” said Jimmy, on why a designer is worth considering. If you’re big on the creative aspect, then make sure you select a designer who you feel will work within your vision rather than commandeer it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Review the MEPs: mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is critical to do before even renting or buying a space (if you’re at this stage, read our earlier <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>). Perhaps the MEPs are so far gone you will opt for a different venue altogether. Regardless, accessing the MEPs will help you set a realistic budget. For example, a decrepit HVAC system can blow the budget out by tens of thousands of dollars, according to Dan Soloway, a hospitality consultant with Kitchen Options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In big bureaucratic cities like New York, connecting the gas can take months, which is why Jimmy no longer uses gas appliances in his establishment. He only uses electric to save clients from costly delays of connecting gas.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Permits for a Restaurant Renovation</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fitting out a new restaurant or renovating an existing one will rope in a lot of government departments—the fire department, the gas provider, buildings department, etc.—from whatever town or city you’re in. The actual permits can be a low-cost item on a budget (Jimmy estimates less than $5,000), but getting those approved can add substantially to the overall restaurant renovation cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before you sign a lease, always check the <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certificate of occupancy</a> (CO). This will dictate what the space can be used for. If it doesn’t give permission for a food and beverage establishment, changing it could be expensive and time-consuming, or in some cases, impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve checked the CO, Jimmy recommends spending the $25,000 or so to bring in a mechanical engineer, a kitchen consultant, and a lawyer. That team can look over everything from the liquor license (if the location has one, which is ideal) to the MEPs that we mentioned above. If these areas are not up to par, that could delay the approval of your permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What if your location isn&#8217;t already approved for a liquor license? It has become increasingly common for clauses to allow restaurateurs to exit the lease if a liquor license application is denied, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. “That’s because the business might hinge on your ability to sell alcohol,” he said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>General construction</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Floors might still need to be laid and bathrooms built or renovated. A survey of more than 700 responses from the industry publication <a href="https://www.restaurantowner.com/public/Survey-How-Much-Does-it-Cost-to-Open-a-Restaurant.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Restaurant Owner</a> found for a medium restaurant—around 3,200 square feet—construction alone or build-out cost an average $50 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if it is a turnkey restaurant, things like accessibility must be up to current standards, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slavica, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjJnJjIEXOM&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40884 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Equipment</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The restaurant renovation cost of fitting out a bar and kitchen, including all the equipment like burners and espresso machines, can be a big budget line item. The Restaurant Owner’s survey put the average cost of a 1,000-square-foot bar and kitchen, including the equipment, at about $75,000, or $80 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurateurs can buy second-hand equipment, but first, they must do their due diligence. That usually involves spending a few hundred dollars for a technician to look over the equipment before buying it, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. There is also the option to lease equipment, which means a reduced upfront payment, but possibly more in the long run. However, the leasing company normally handles repairs and might even provide things like detergent with a dishwasher.</p>
<h3><b>Rent and labor contingency</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, things can go wrong in a renovation. On average, the Restaurant Owner’s survey found that the overrun on a restaurant remodel budget to be 34 percent. Numerous hurdles can slow down your opening and delay that exciting moment when you make your first sale. Meanwhile, you&#8217;re still paying rent for the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I think your pre-opening rent can be a big wild card. It usually takes much longer to open than you think it does,” said Jimmy, from ESquared Hospitality. A six-month rent contingency can be a business-saver, as is a few months&#8217; contingency for staff costs. Sometimes staff members are already hired—manager, chef, sommelier, etc.—and on the payroll when a delay arises. A labor contingency means you can continue paying them during the delay. Otherwise, they could look for new jobs, which means starting the hiring process from scratch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assessing and writing a restaurant renovation cost plan is like charting a new land—confusing, tedious, and with a few questions marks. However, having a realistic budget can set you up for success while bringing you one step closer to your dream business. Here is a budget breakdown for a 2,000-<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">square-foot</span> <span style="color: #000000;">restaurant in</span> <span style="color: #000000;">New York City by</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Tony</a><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Westchester County </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no doubt that Westchester is a picturesque place to live—the luxury of space and peace with the bustle of New York City a quick trip away. Some recent buyers and established homeowners alike feel it would be even more idyllic if they had their dream kitchen, whether it&#8217;s renovating a new home or fulfilling a long-desired wish to upgrade. The first step is often the stumbling block: determining the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/kitchen-renovation-costs-money-goes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">national average</a> for a basic 200-square-foot kitchen renovation is $63,829.  Westchester County has a slightly higher average <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation cost</a> landing at <strong>$65,651</strong> or <strong>$328 a square foot</strong>, according to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association (NKBA). Let’s break that budget down into bite-sized pieces to help you get closer to your dream cooking and entertaining space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DESIGN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an important line item in your budget, especially if your vision involves a layout change. That could involve moving load-bearing walls and gas lines. The NKBA estimates design fees eat up about four percent of a kitchen remodel cost. Sweeten designer <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, who has done work in Westchester, said it&#8217;s more realistic to put away 15 percent of your budget for design if you’re in the mood for a major layout change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re giving your kitchen more of a makeover than an overhaul, it’s possible to work closely with an experienced general contractor on the design and forgo a designer. Statistics from the NKBA show that the majority of homeowners relied on a general contractor and only 22 percent used a designer. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck</a>, a Sweeten contractor who works in Westchester, has found that many clients in the county take a hands-on approach to design and often don’t use a designer or architect. However, an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect&#8217;s services will be needed</a> if plumbing or gas lines are moving, there are structural changes, or if a landmark property is being renovated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PERMITS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building permits are handled by the building department of each individual town within Westchester County. &#8220;Individual&#8221; is the key word here because methods of calculations can change dramatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Rye, the most of the <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/money/real-estate/homes/2017/03/22/westchester-priciest-zipcodes/99506058/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive</a> area in Southern Westchester—the median price for a home is $1,380,000—it’s no surprise that building permits are calculated based on the cost of a renovation. For every $1,000 in your kitchen remodel budget, that’s an additional $17 for your building permits. That average $64,000 kitchen overhaul will cost at least $1,088 in permits. If plumbing and electrical permits are required, that’s an additional $200 a pop (for a less extensive renovation, these permits may not be necessary).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the township of Peekskill, building permit costs are at the end of a minor mathematical equation. Multiply the square footage of your project by $150. Then, multiply that figure by 0.10. For a 200-square-foot kitchen, that’s $3,000. So take a moment to look at how the building department of your township calculates permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/westchester-county-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-34831 size-full" title="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png" alt="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" width="320" height="60" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png 320w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>APPLIANCES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Village Appliances in Westchester, a budget appliance package (fridge, oven, dishwasher and microwave), can go for under $5,000. However, Joe Gagliardo, the owner of Village Appliances, doesn’t sell too many of those. The majority of customers either go for a package in the $5,000 to $8,000 range or in the mid-price range of $18,000 to $22,000, which will get you brands such as General Electric and Electrolux. The high-end price spectrum will deliver brands such as Viking and Miele for a four-piece suite (fridge, range, hood, and dishwasher) at a price ranging from $17,000 to $26,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At <a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bilotta Kitchens</a>, clients often buy in the $12,000 to $15,000 range for an appliance package, according to senior designer and CKD Randy O’Kane. This will get you brands such as Thermador, Sub-Zero, and Wolf. There’s always room to mix and match, but brands do offer a discount or throw in items like blenders, toasters and hoods for free if you go with the same brand for your appliances, Randy said. “It is the heart and soul of a kitchen,” she said. “Cabinets are great, but it is all about cooking.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation can cost between $500 and $1,000, and that price will depend on how much work your contractor has already done. If water lines have not been run or outlets are not in the necessary areas, that could push up installation costs, Joe said. For those after custom range hoods, then plan for the $2,000 and $8,000 range.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-peninsula-golden-chairs" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-32475 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen peninsula with golden chairs and blue kitchen cabinets with silver appliances after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label">(Above) Tracey and Brian&#8217;s Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-stamp-of-approval-for-a-westchester-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation</a> in Pelham Manor, New York</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CABINETS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinets and hardware (think handles and knobs) are a big-ticket item on every kitchen remodel cost budget. They typically take up 30 percent of costs, according to NKBA. In a basic kitchen renovation, that’s $6,000. For a major overhaul worth $60,000, cabinets cost almost $20,000. What typically makes a big <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difference in cabinet cost</a> is whether you want custom, pre-fabricated or a mix of both. Something pre-fabricated from IKEA or Home Depot will cost around $130 a linear foot. Custom jobs can shoot up to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear square foot</a>. However, with that higher price, there is more freedom in deciding your kitchen layout. You can also get <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a> with custom cabinets. Semi-custom cabinets generally are about 50 percent cheaper than full custom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or do what Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill did in her own kitchen renovation: the recycled customized option. &#8220;I scoured Renovation Angel&#8217;s website and purchased a used-but-high-end kitchen for about $10,000, which is what I could have spent on cabinets alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A complete kitchen included appliances and cabinetry.&#8221; Jean then customized the cabinets to fit her space, which often meant filler panels were wider on one side than the other, or building a soffit was necessary. &#8220;It was like working on a jigsaw puzzle in order to make the kitchen look like it fit in the space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I was okay with these kinds of imperfections in exchange for essentially getting a premium kitchen on an Ikea type of budget.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>COUNTERTOPS</strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.westchesterkitchenandbath.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester Kitchen and Bath</a>, quartz is overwhelmingly the most popular countertop, according to showroom manager and designer Donna Magnotta. “It’s heat-, stain-, scratch-, and bacteria-resistant,” she said, “and it&#8217;s maintenance-free.” Natural stones, like marble, need routine staining and sealing. Quartz starts around $85 per linear foot and is on the mid to high-end of the price scale, which includes the cost of fabricating and installing. Laminate starts at $20 a linear foot, but is rarely purchased, Donna said. Granite is next up the ladder at about $35 a linear foot. On the high end, natural stones start at about $120 a linear foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LIGHTING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kitchen lighting isn’t a big budget line item. It takes up on four percent of total costs on average. The end price, of course, will always be determined by your tastes. In a $20,000 kitchen, that’s only $800. For a major remodel in the $60,000 range, lighting costs look closer to $2,400.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PLUMBING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On an average remodel, plumbing costs are about the same at $800. If there is a layout change to your Westchester kitchen, then that will likely add to your plumbing costs, which also includes gas lines. And the more you alter the basic layout of your space, the more your kitchen remodel cost will increase for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting, and inspections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FLOORING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a budget, Westchester’s <a href="https://suburbanfloors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suburban Floors</a> has a vinyl Karndean-Knight Tile that is $3.50 a square foot that is “still very durable and stylish,” said Emily Carpentieri, the store’s owner. The price per square foot does not include installation. On the higher end is cork or wide-plank wood flooring. These go for $8.25 to $15 a square foot. But vinyl floors in the $5 to $7 range is Suburban Floors’ biggest seller. “These would blow your mind how real they looked,” said Emily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LABOR AND INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction labor can change depending upon your Westchester zip code. The costs are less expensive the further you are from NYC. For Peekskill, labor costs are 22 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr.com</a>. Dobbs Ferry comes in at 40 percent higher and Croton-on-Hudson at 27 percent higher than the national average. The kitchen renovation cost in Rye could have a labor budget 55 percent above the national average. To compare, the labor cost for a kitchen renovation on the Upper East Side is 77 percent higher than the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t forget installation for appliances, cabinetry, plumbing, and electrical. These typically take about 17 percent of a budget, which is about $3,500 for an average kitchen. And as mentioned above, factor in $500 to $1,000 for appliance installation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, renovations are like fingerprints<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no two are alike. That includes their budgets. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator in Westchester allocated their $56,620 renovation budget:</p>
