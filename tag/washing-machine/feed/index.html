										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>If you thought this appliance was indispensable now, features like self-cleaning, an integrated sink, and a mini washer will wash your socks right off</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DavisonKitchen-06_Crop.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22857 size-chrono" title="washing machine" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DavisonKitchen-06_Crop-723x506.jpg" alt="washing machine" width="723" height="506" /></a>(Above) A washing machine tucked under the counter in Davison and Bernice&#8217;s kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doing laundry is unavoidable, but happily, washing machines are doing more of the heavy lifting for you. Digital controls, cycles tailored for everything from delicates to lycra to bath towels, vibration reduction, and childproof locks make wash day safer and less of a chore. While innovation breakthroughs have not gone so far as to make washing machines touchless, like some other appliances, there are more than a few new features that further reduce the time spent while increasing efficiency. Here’s a rundown:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The pros of front-loading</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The washing machine with the door that opens from the front, as opposed to the top, is not brand new; Europeans have enjoyed this feature for decades. However, it is becoming more widely available from manufacturers. The advantages: Front-loading machines require less water, can take more clothes, and tend to clean more gently and thoroughly than their top-loading counterparts. Top-loaders wash with the help of an agitator. Versions without the agitator are high-efficiency (HE) washers. Like front-loaders, they use less water, have larger capacities, require more time to wash, and spin faster, too, wringing out more water to save drying time later. They also cost more than the agitator version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Automatic dispensers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This receptacle releases detergent, bleach, and fabric softener, each at the appropriate time, so you don’t have to hang around waiting for just the right moment. Every minute saved is a minute you get back to do something else.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Self-cleaning and low maintenance</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Water will collect in the machine, particularly front-loading models, without evaporating if you wash frequently, creating a risk of mildew and bacteria. New technology now keeps washers fresh, without introducing chemicals, through a combination of soaking, pulsating, and high-speed spinning. And you thought self-clean was just for ovens!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23154 size-chrono" title="two-in-one washer and dryer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="washing machine" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) Tim and Lindsay&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/overhauling-upper-west-side-co-op-make-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-in-one washer and dryer</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Load capacity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Capacities for front- and top-loading machines can range from about 3.8 cubic feet up to 6 cubic feet. Your habits for doing laundry—weekly loads of towels or sports clothes versus say, small loads separated by color—will guide your decision. Larger capacity machines help cut down the number of washes you run. Expect to pay more for these models.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Steam wash</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Released from inside the washer, steam helps remove stains without pretreatment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Secondary access door</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have a top loader and you stumble upon that missing dirty sock, no problem. But what if your machine is a front loader? Now you’re in luck: Last year saw the introduction of a front-loading model with a secondary access door that lets you add small items mid-wash from Samsung.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-55-AFTER.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27425 size-chrono" title="washer and dryer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-55-AFTER-723x482.jpg" alt="washing machine" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) A <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-basement-turns-into-family-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">front-loading washer and dryer</a> in Cristiana&#8217;s laundry room located in the basement of her home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Integrated sink</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’ve ever soaked clothing with a pesky stain, you’ve probably had the experience of rushing with the drippy item from the sink to the washing machine, then going back to wipe up soapy water on the floor. No more. Samsung makes a top-loading machine with a hinged sink on top of the wash drum. A water jet aids the soaking or scrubbing; when the item is ready for the wash, lift the sink to drop the clothing through a slot at the back and into the machine, then begin the cycle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Two-in-one machine</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you like to wash small loads of a particular color, or can’t wait to launder those sweaty gym clothes; the two-in-one machine is for you. In addition to a central or primary drum, there’s another smaller drum at the base or top of the machine. You can run both washers simultaneously or independently, as needed. LG also offers a compact washer that can be retro-fitted to an existing machine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Black stainless steel finish</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Less industrial looking than its silvery-colored older sibling, black stainless steel makes a stylish statement in the laundry room, joining the ranks of ever-classic white, and some colors, too, which you may find on the market for a few seasons.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Last week in part 1</a>, we visited architect Tina and her husband Fletcher&#8217;s duplex in Cobble Hill. She gave us the tour of the kitchen and powder room on the upper parlor level. Now we&#8217;re back to view their bedrooms and master bath on the garden level. Here&#8217;s how the couple and their contractor transformed a level with lower ceilings and semi-subterranean location into a cozy and very chic space.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>, we decided to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinish</a> the dark wood floors throughout our duplex apartment to brighten the living space. It was especially needed in the bedrooms on the lower level. We ran into our first delay after work began on the floors. Initially, we selected a weathered oak finish, but our mistake was not testing it before moving forward. It wasn’t until after the entire lower level had been sanded and re-stained that we learned the red oak floors didn’t take the color as we had expected. To complicate things, we discovered the wood on the stairs was white oak, while the upper level floor was maple. The renovation timeline was delayed a week as we tested combinations of stains to find a neutralizing color that worked on all three wood types. Fletcher made the ultimate selection of Bona Grey, and we could not be happier with how it turned out!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The new floors immediately brightened the lower level of the duplex, which was key in disguising its semi-subterranean status. In addition to a lighter floor stain, we painted the bedroom walls with light colors—a cool gray in the baby&#8217;s nursery and a calming off-white in the master bedroom. White bedroom furniture, accents, and linens maintained the bright palette. To give the impression of larger windows, we added floor-to-ceiling sheer curtains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lower level had no base molding or traditional casing around the windows, and the interior doors styles were flat with concealed hinges, creating a sterile look. To introduce more character, we added base trim throughout the bedrooms and shaker-style panel doors. Our contractor helped us realize how cost-effective this strategy was. It was a low-cost improvement that made a huge impact. The garden level feels as comfortable and inviting as the upper living area.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We were already very pleased with the layout of the main bath, and found it was efficiently designed. Within a small space, it contained a tub—essential for our growing family—a large walk-in shower, and even a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washing machine and dryer</a> that already existed! It may have been more convenient to have them in a room where we could fold laundry, but we were happy to not give up significant apartment real estate. We just avoid running the ventless dryer while taking a shower. The amount of moisture in the room can become overwhelming!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the powder room upstairs, we kept the original Duravit fixtures, and were conscious of choosing materials that would make the space feel larger and brighter. This was especially important because we decided to tear out the existing back-lit vanity mirror that spanned the entire length of the main bath wall. And it was actually effective in making the room feel larger but we replaced it with a more traditional vanity mirror and sconce lighting. We continued the marble mosaic into the shower to avoid visually dividing the space, and kept the walls bright with the same Nemo white 2&#215;8 subway tile used for the kitchen backsplash.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to our Sweeten contractor and his crew, the renovation process was relatively quick and painless. By having the design decisions completed before work began, we eliminated on-the-go decision-making and were able to work with the team and budget effectively. We were happy to have a contractor with a calm disposition, who was extremely sensitive to our schedule and accommodating to hiccups in the process.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Although the work moved quickly, it wasn’t completed on schedule due to minor delays. Working with a tight timeline, there was little room for contingency. Our scheduled move-in landed just a week before our baby’s due date. As luck would have it, I went into labor early, on moving day!<span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because our kitchen cabinets had been delayed a few weeks, we returned from the hospital as they were being installed. We introduced our newborn to a home with appliances stacked in the living room and unpacked boxes occupying the rest of the apartment. We camped out as a family in the nursery (equipped with my college dorm mini-fridge) for a week while major work was being completed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two weeks after our move and into parenthood, the renovation was 95% complete. We unpacked boxes while the baby slept. Talk about exhausting! Looking back, transitioning was certainly hectic, but we couldn’t be happier with our new home. It is the perfect environment for our growing family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">With extra square footage and smart space planning, you can check the washing machine and dryer off on your wish list</h2>
<p class="p1"><em>Editor’s Note</em>: This post, originally published March 2015, is one of our favorites, demonstrating different ways to incorporate the coveted washing machine into a floorpan—even a small one. City living means prioritizing your square footage similar to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs; wish lists often include a dishwasher, a patch of landscape, and of course, the washer/dryer unit. If you do have space to spare, consider options from scaled-down stackable units, full-size side-by-sides, or a single machine. Before you make your product choice, read on for a few approvals and permits you’ll need to secure first, as well as insight from Sweeten homeowners who went through the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20733 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Closet-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1387" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Closet-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Closet-03-216x300.jpg 216w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Closet-03-600x832.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Closet-03-723x1003.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Felix created a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-gets-a-nordic-look-for-bathrooms-and-closets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laundry nook</a> in her foyer</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Building management approvals and permits</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Space aside, the biggest roadblocks to in-unit laundry are typically the co-op and condo board regulations that ban washers and dryers in many apartment buildings. In some, the electrical grid is not up to meeting the demand that dryers (specifically) place on the system, and in other cases, the existing pipe stacks are not large enough to handle the increase in water and suds flow. Still in many other cases, fears that a washing machine will overflow and dryers will lead to flames have traditionally been enough to block tenant plans for laundry upgrades.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-12781"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If your building&#8217;s management is onboard with your request to install laundry appliances, you may still need to meet certain safety requirements. Many buildings will require that you install a fixture that monitors water flow and shuts off water if any overflow is detected, and some buildings have electrical grid limitations that only allow low-voltage dryers. So, if you&#8217;re considering adding laundry appliances to your home, start first with your building&#8217;s management and confirm that your planned purchase is allowed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, NYC <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/homeowner/permits.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">requires permits for work that involves &#8220;alteration, re-arrangement, relocation, or permanent removal&#8221;</a> of any piping, so if your laundry plan requires anything other than a direct swap of an appliance, you need to work with your contractor to arrange for the right plumbing expertise and paperwork. Check your local Department of Buildings for specific local requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are three roads to clean-clothes heaven, plus some budget notes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. Create a laundry cabinet in your kitchen</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ubiquitous in Europe, a combo washer-dryer under your kitchen counter is a super space-efficient way to make room for laundry. A few pros and cons here: the biggest complaint about space and energy-efficient washer-dryers is that they can only manage small loads. Duvets, etc, are a no-go here, making this a tough choice for families or households with multiple residents. The next most common complaint is that these combination machines do a half-hearted job of drying fabric. True, the high-heat steam does leave clothing a little damp when it comes out, but this drying method also tends to be kinder to clothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From a budget perspective, if you are already doing a full kitchen renovation, creating a cabinet for laundry appliances is a relatively seamless addition to your project&#8217;s total scope. Adding a washing machine and dryer to your kitchen requires access to the water supply, waste outlet, and electricity. Talk to your contractor about whether to build cabinetry around the unit, or enclose it with a custom door, and where to position the appliances for best access. You can expect the cost to account for the price of adding an additional cabinet and the cost for installation will likely be comparable to your contractor&#8217;s quote for hooking up your other kitchen appliances.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25708 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_06-07.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="667" />Blaise and Kristin built out a wall and added doors in their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brooklyn-kitchen-and-laundry-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laundry renovation</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. Build walls and a door </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If space is not the primary limitation in your home, you may want to repurpose square footage in a room or hallway to create a separate laundry room. Your contractor&#8217;s estimate will probably account for the cost of putting up or extending walls, installing doors, adding or relocating lighting, and cosmetic paint and trim steps. More work may be required here to run hot and cold water from the building&#8217;s stack and to connect waste lines, if these valves are not located within a few inches of your new appliances. Note that most urban buildings have strict requirements about keeping &#8220;wet&#8221; areas aligned throughout each floor, so you may not have free reign to run water lines down halls if your home is above other homes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. Move walls to carve out a laundry room</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prospect Heights homeowner Brad walked us through the full process of creating a laundry room for his family&#8217;s three-bedroom, three-bath condo. After Brad <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project on Sweeten</a>, we introduced him to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a> to remove an un-used shower from one of the apartment&#8217;s baths and rework wall placement, creating a full-sized laundry room. Brad set an overall budget of about $20,000 for labor, materials and appliances—a helpful guide for other homeowners preparing for a laundry room renovation—and was able to keep the project on time and within budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Materials and placement</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brad and his wife wanted front-loading appliances that were both generously-sized and durable. <a href="https://www.kenmore.com/products/laundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenmore Elite</a> appliances with 5.2 cubic foot capacity fit the bill. In discussing ways to deal with water flow, the contractor steered him away from installing a floor pan that would catch overflow water and instead selected a preventative automatic sensor that scans for the presence of water on the floor and immediately shuts off the water if it detects any. Brad also hired an electrician to assess the building&#8217;s electrical capacity and clear the appliances they planned to purchase.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially planning to stack the washing machine and dryer, he was encouraged to install them side-by-side because of two factors behind the walls: the location of the water pipes in the wall as well as the wall&#8217;s support structure grid of metal beams made it easier to hook up appliances if they were positioned side-by-side. Once demolition of the original wall occurred, it became clear that stacked appliances would be more difficult, so Brad embraced the plan to place both units on the floor and go with Elfa shelving from the Container Store. Brad also contemplated building in enclosed cabinetry, but input from his contractor suggested he consider the simpler open shelving approach. To finish off the room, a ceramic floor tile from Home Depot was installed which coordinated with other bath finishes in the condo. A folding table and ironing board are possible features to add to the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Demolition and build</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project took a total of 2-3 weeks. Brad reported that the demolition of the original drywall was fairly simple: the wall was not load-bearing and didn&#8217;t contain any critical support beams. The contractor&#8217;s team was careful to protect the family&#8217;s hallways and living areas and contain the dust that resulted from the demolition. Brad suggested the pocket door replace the original hinged door to minimize the door&#8217;s footprint and keep access to the room as open as possible. Pocket doors can be prohibitively expensive if you are tunneling into a brick or concrete wall, but in this case, the wall structure easily allowed for the alteration.</p>
