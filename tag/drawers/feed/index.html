										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These kitchen pantry designs prove that out-of-the-way organization can fit in apartments <em>and</em> single-family homes</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44167 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg" alt="kitchen, kitchen island, Brooklyn kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><strong>Storage, storage, storage.</strong> They say that in real estate that location is key. When it comes to kitchens, plenty of storage is essential. Kitchen pantries are easy and popular ways to increase the square footage of storage in your kitchen. Don&#8217;t worry—pantries don&#8217;t have to be massive (but they can be if you have the space for it!) With careful and creative design, smaller areas can serve as a place to put food items, serving accessories, dishes, and cleaning products.</p>
<p>Here, we share examples of different kitchen pantry designs from homeowners who <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked with a Sweeten contractor</a> to ensure they had ample storage in their homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Repurposing an entryway</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45625" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For these Montclair, New Jersey homeowners, updating the kitchen of their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new home</a> was a must. It felt small and claustrophobic, and only had eight feet of usable counter space. The configuration needed a lot of improvement. They worked with a Sweeten contractor to rework the layout.</p>
<p>The first thing they did was to remove an old butler&#8217;s pantry, which <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freed up space to add an island</a>. However, a pantry was still on their wish list, so they got rid of an unused cellar entrance and converted it into a walk-in pantry.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Pull-out drawers</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42272" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gina and Andrew</a> were uninspired by their dated kitchen that featured drab cabinets and an inconvenient layout. It was completely sectioned off from the living area and desperately needed a refresh. Working with their Sweeten contractor, the couple reimagined the layout to make it a functional and stylish kitchen. The cherry on top? The new floor-to-ceiling pantry with pull-out drawers. Pull-out drawers are always a plus since they help keep the space organized and provide easy-to-access item storage.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Floor-to-ceiling storage in a small apartment</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47056" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For Sweeten renovator Michele, it all started with a bathroom remodel, and the desire to replace her dishwasher. That turned into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/renovating-a-bathroom-kitchen-to-make-home-a-happier-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full gut reno of her kitchen</a>—but it was a change of plans that she was very happy with. Her Sweeten contractor recommended renovating to use the unused space near the entrance more efficiently. That got the ball rolling. The result is a large pantry, which fits in between the refrigerator and dishwasher. &#8220;Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment,&#8221; says Michele.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Wraparound pantry with copious storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44170" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-11a.gif" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadia and Stephen</a> were searching for a home that would fit their multigenerational family. They found it in their 2,300-square-foot home in Brooklyn, New York. The most striking design feature in their new home is the massive wraparound kitchen pantry. They added full-height cabinets since the area had a limit of 15-inch depths. This gave them plenty of storage space for serving ware, food items, and cleaning products.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Hidden door-style storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-Apt-11.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For their Park Slope two-bedroom co-op, Tara and Brian found a Sweeten contractor to help them <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rework their kitchen layout</a>. To lighten a hardworking wall that contained the stove, refrigerator, sink, and cabinetry, their contractor suggested relocating the refrigerator to an existing cluster of storage cabinets just outside the kitchen proper. The wall instantly felt lighter. Where the fridge once stood, the contractor cleverly made a small pantry, matching the &#8220;concealed&#8221; concept. When closed, the pantry looks like a tiled wall, but opens to reveal 10-inch deep shelves.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The kitchen&#8217;s helper</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26915 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen pantry" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nazli passed on upper cabinets so that she could mimic the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feeling of an open-plan apartment</a> on the first floor of her townhouse, establishing a clear line of vision from her front room all the way to the dining room. To make sure there was enough storage, the contractor created a walk-in pantry. Since the pantry is open to the rest of the kitchen, Nazli decided to paint it a darker color so that its contents wouldn&#8217;t be too distracting, allowing it to blend into its surroundings and almost disappear from sight.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></p>
<p>These kitchen pantry designs are just one aspect of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/entertaining-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">having a kitchen designed for stress-free cooking and entertaining</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b></b>It’s time to get creative with kitchen storage and organization</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In most homes, the kitchen is in constant use. If yours is on the small side, keeping it organized is crucial to maintaining an enjoyable, efficient cook space. The key is to make sure that everything has a home and lives in a spot that is easily accessible. Since it’s not always possible to add extra square footage to your kitchen, you’ll have to get inventive with the space you do have. In order to inspire you to do just that, we’ve rounded up seven of the best kitchen storage solutions within Sweeten renovations that make use of every (and we mean every) nook and cranny.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24135 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="kitchen storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-remodel-breaks-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily’s kitchen</a> in downtown Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Use the height of your ceilings to extend your cabinets and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boost kitchen storage</a>. The lower cabinets can be used for everyday items while those higher up can store items you reach for less frequently, like that fondue pot. You can even store non-kitchen stuff up there, like winter clothes or camping gear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Giovanni_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22645 size-chrono" title="studio kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Giovanni_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="kitchen storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/tired-kitchen-gets-jumpstart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giovanni’s kitchen</a> in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you live in a studio apartment, closet space is scarce. Rather than adding a washer or dryer to a closet, and thereby losing precious real estate, tuck one or two <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laundry units</a> under your kitchen <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peninsula</a>. Now you can use some of that closet space for kitchen essentials—like pantry goods and servingware for special occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-goes-low-maintenance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26036 size-chrono" title="silver-appliances-small-white-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Cybele-Kitchen-1.gif" alt="silver appliances in a small white kitchen with white cabinets and double hung window after renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-goes-low-maintenance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cybele’s kitchen</a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A corner usually means the end of the line for a row of cabinets—that is, unless you go custom. Take advantage of an awkward corner spot with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom-built cabinet</a>, maximizing every available inch.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26032 size-chrono" title="galley kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen storage" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/white-walls-and-black-hardware-in-a-windowed-pre-war-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upper West Side kitchen</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are pros and cons to having more than one window in the kitchen. More windows mean more natural light, which is a definite plus, but it can also mean limiting the number of upper cabinets you can fit in the space. Adding custom shelves to your <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exhaust hood</a> is one smart way to make use of dead space. Another is building cabinets beneath the windows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-08-09.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-18502 size-chrono" title="kitchen drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-08-09.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="600" height="899" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron’s kitchen</a> on the Upper East Side</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like corner cabinets, custom drawers can take advantage of tight corners where cabinets or drawers placed side-by-side would ordinarily block one another when opened.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Claudia-Kitchen.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26041 size-chrono" title="patterned-floor-small-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Claudia-Kitchen.gif" alt="patterned floor in a small kitchen with white kitchen cabinets and cooking range after renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a style="text-align: justify;" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claudia’s kitchen</a><span style="text-align: justify;"> on the Upper East Side</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have a few inches of space between your range and your cabinets, or in this case, your fridge, maximize your kitchen storage with a pull-out rack. It can be a handy spot for storing cutting boards, trays, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spices</a>—you name it.</p>
