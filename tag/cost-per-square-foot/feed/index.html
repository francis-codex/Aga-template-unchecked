<p>The Hamptons…the mere mention conjures up images of poolside luxury and endless summer. But what’s it really like to live—and renovate—there? If you’re considering buying a home in the East End to renovate, there are some things you should know. Luckily for you, we’ve done the homework! Read on to learn what to expect (and budget) for your Hamptons renovation costs. (Keep in mind that all projects are unique, and many variables will impact a remodel!)</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> offers a guide to Hamptons renovation costs, focusing on four categories—cost per square foot, kitchen, bathroom, and permits. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p>Note: every expert contractor will want to have a detailed chat and inspection of your home before creating an estimate for your needs and wants.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of typical Hamptons renovation costs, compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling’s</em> 2023 <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full home renovation: Starting at <strong>$100 per square foot (psf)</strong> with stock materials; high-end properties start at <strong>$250+ psf</strong></li>
<li>Budget kitchen remodel: <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: <strong>$40,000—$75,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end kitchen remodel: <strong>$75,000+</strong></li>
<li>Budget bath remodel: <strong>$20,000</strong></li>
<li>Mid-grade bath remodel:<strong> $25,000—$40,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end bath remodel: <strong>$40,000—$100,000</strong></li>
<li>Basement remodel: <strong>$25,000—$100,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear: when referring to the Hamptons, we are talking about the <a href="https://www.southamptontownny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Town of Southampton</a> and the <a href="https://ehamptonny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Town of East Hampton</a>, which both comprise many hamlets and villages. Hamlets such as Westhampton, East Quogue, or Hampton Bays lie within the boundaries of the town of Southampton. The villages of Amagansett and East Hampton are within the administrative boundaries of the town of East Hampton. So, any building permits filed will be with the offices of Southampton or East Hampton.</p>
<p>There is a season for everything, but especially in the Hamptons. <span class="s1">Usually, there is a big push before summer so that everyone can enjoy their homes before the summer is out, and everyone is very busy. If possible, start your design process in the fall and do the work in the winter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-48218 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="40" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1-300x20.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br><br>Hamptons home renovation costs per square foot</h3>
<p>According to experts who work in both New York City and the Hamptons, the consensus is that costs per square foot are essentially the same in both locales. As we point out in our cost guide to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-square-foot-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester County</a>, proximity to Manhattan dictates both the buyer demographic as well as real estate values. This, in turn, is reflected in the cost of renovations. As Sweeten contractor Eric points out, however, there are subtle differences between the villages and hamlets, with East Hampton being the priciest. Sweeten sees projects starting at <strong>$100 per square foot</strong> with stock materials and high-end properties at <strong>$250+ psf</strong>.</p>
<p>While renovation costs per square foot will vary depending on whether it is a gut or non-gut, and the level of finishes and custom features you require, Eric tells us that there is a starting point of <strong>$150 psf</strong> for renovations with stock materials. Luxury waterfront properties, however, start at <strong>$500 psf</strong> for high-end renovations and can exceed <strong>$1,000</strong> depending on complexity and finishes. (See <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Budget Basics: Renovation Costs Per Square Foot</a>, where we outline three levels of renovation.)</p>
<p>Additionally, cost increases over the past year have also pushed baseline budgets upwards: the price of fuel has gone up, as has general liability insurance, said Sweeten contractor Eric. “Building materials are also up from last year because of supply and demand; everyone is renovating! And when homeowners are renovating, the cost for electricians and plumbers and other subs increase, because they can pick and choose between the most profitable jobs. They will charge more now for smaller jobs like a single kitchen or bath.”</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition/">Costs for a kitchen renovation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Budget kitchen: Most budget-friendly Sweeten kitchen remodels&nbsp;average <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet with basic finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen: Most Sweeten mid-grade can fall between <strong>$40,000—$75,000</strong>. In Sweeten contractor John&#8217;s experience, he cites a mid-grade kitchen could average in the <strong>$75,000</strong> range.&nbsp;<a href="https://arielokin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariel Okin</a>, an interior designer who works in the Hamptons, tells us: “Kitchen gut renovations can range from <strong>$40,000—$150,000</strong> depending on the level of work the client wants, and the same goes for baths. Square footage, scope of work, and estimated amount of time it will take to complete the job are all major considerations that go into pricing out the project.”</li>
<li>High-end kitchen:&nbsp;At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen projects cost start at <strong>$75,000</strong> for high-end finishes. According to <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</a><span class="s2">, a major high-end kitchen remodel averages $178,347 in New York.&nbsp;</span><br>This is based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with top-of-the-line custom cabinets, stone countertops, imported tile backsplash, built-in refrigerator, microwave, commercial-grade cooktop, and vent hood, as well as all new lighting and wood floors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sweeten contractor John estimates that a high-end kitchen in the Hamptons will start at <strong>$150,000</strong> and up.</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-national-edition/">Costs for a bathroom renovation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Budget bathroom remodel: At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen projects begin at <strong>$20,000</strong>. John quotes a three-piece (shower, sink, and toilet) project to average out to about <strong>$35,000&nbsp;</strong>for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Sweeten has completed bathroom renovations between <strong>$25,000—$40,000</strong> in the mid-range that covers about 100 square feet. </span></span><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/?bwts=1692367227">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</a><span class="s2"> cites an average of <strong>$29,915</strong> for a mid-grade bath remodel.</span></li>
<li>High-end bathroom remodel: At the high-end range, Sweeten renovations that consist of three-pieces can cost between <strong>$40,000—$60,000</strong>. A high-end master suite remodel consisting of 4-5 pieces including a shower, double sink, bathtub, and toilet costs between <strong>$60,000—$100,000</strong>. According to Remodeling’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/?bwts=1692367227"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</span></a>, a high-end bathroom remodel averages <strong>$88,223</strong> in New York. This is based on expanding an existing 35-square-foot bathroom to 100 square feet, relocating all fixtures, and installing a new shower with a frameless glass enclosure, freestanding soaker tub with high-end faucets, stone counters with dual sinks, one-piece toilet, and a humidistat-controlled exhaust fan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sweeten contractor John estimates that a high-end master bath renovation would run about <strong>$100,000</strong> on average.</p>
<h3>Costs for a basement renovation</h3>
<p>At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/sweeten-renovations/basement-renovations/">basement remodels</a> budgeted at <strong>$100—$150 psf</strong> or <strong>$25,000</strong> for a simple coat of paint. A gut renovation would cost <strong>$50,000—$100,000</strong> which could include plumbing, electrical, an entertainment center, appliances, closets, and with possible walls going up or down.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What to know about permits in the Hamptons</h3>
<p>Permits are a big part of the renovation process in Hamptons towns. While expediters are not regularly used there, the process can involve two types of <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">experts not usually called upon in renovation projects</a> elsewhere.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental consultants</strong> can assist homeowners and architects in parsing land use regulations, coastal environmental planning, and acquisition of related permits. Given the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/">delicate ecosystems</a> and the proliferation of wetlands and sand dunes along the coasts, these consultants are crucial to navigating this aspect of the permit process. Additionally, they can answer help determine whether you can expand the footprint of a house or add a dock. They typically charge by the hour (ranging from <strong>$250-350/hour</strong>, with a minimum project fee). For the initial site inspection and report, some offer a flat rate fee of around <strong>$1,500. </strong>This fee would cover the property inspection and produce a report.</li>
<li><strong>Local attorneys</strong> who are well-versed in the zoning codes of the particular town in question can help navigate the process. Sweeten architect Andrew tells us that East Hampton recently changed some of its codes and a local attorney assisted him and his client in liaising with the town office on a debated matter of allowable square footage. Attorneys’ fees vary; a local real estate agent can provide recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keeping up with local regulations and requirements</h3>
<p>While the town offices may be small and provide a more personal interaction, as Sweeten architect Andrew relates, don’t mistake that casual air for a casual approach to enforcing regulations. For example, certain Hamptons neighborhoods won’t allow work on weekends, or after a certain time during high season. There have also been increasing attempts to limit the square footage on properties and accessory structures that may be used as rental properties. Additionally, there are stringent regulations at the town, state, and federal levels that will affect your renovation, depending on scope.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s important to understand what the current code is. However, you should also try to find out what is upcoming or anticipated in terms of changes. Because project timelines can extend, you want to ensure you&#8217;re complying with the relevant codes when your project finishes.</span></p>
<p>One relatively recent development has been<a href="https://ehamptonny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/2224/Adopt-Local-Law-Amending-Chapter-102-to-Adopt-HERS-Rating-Energy-Conservation-Requirements-PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a change in the energy conservation requirements</a> in East Hampton, for example. Andrew notes that he is dealing with this on a current project. Now, they&#8217;ll need to hire someone who is certified to complete the HERS rating, which will cost between <strong>$1,000—$2,000</strong>. They may also need to use different building components to achieve better insulation and R-value required today.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.southamptontownny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/599/Building-Zoning-Fee-Schedule--Residential-PDF?bidId=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building permits</a> for residential interior remodeling permits run <strong>$65 psf</strong> up to <strong>2,000 square feet</strong> on the first story of a house with a <strong>$50</strong> fee for up to<strong> $1,000</strong> of estimated construction cost (ECC).</li>
<li>This <a href="https://www.southamptontownny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/600/Electrical-Fee-Schedule-PDF?bidId=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrical Permit Fee Schedule</a> indicates that electrical permits range from a minimum of <strong>$50</strong> for a re-inspection to <strong>$1,000</strong> for additions, renovations, basement wiring, and garages with more than 7 devices over 15,000 square feet.</li>
<li>Fees for plumbing fixtures are <strong>$5</strong> per fixture with a <strong>$50</strong> minimum.</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>(Above) A <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/an-nyc-office-renovation-to-expand-working-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new commercial office remodel with Sweeten</a> for an NYC-based tech brand</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps you have outgrown your home office or coworking space or maybe your business is in need of a fresh location or configuration. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office renovation</a> will give you a chance to dream long-term about where your business is heading and interpret that direction into blueprints for a space that will facilitate growth. In this guide, we&#8217;ll consider the many pieces of your office renovation cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An office renovation can be as simple as an improvement project that is negotiated between the landlord and the tenant before signing a lease. Often these are very basic renovations such as fresh paint and some new walls that the tenant ultimately pays for in the cost of the lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are after something more custom, there are, of course, many variables that will determine the cost per square foot. Is the location a new or old building? Was it previously an office? What part of the country will your office be in? What are your business needs? And what quality of work will match those needs?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new building with a basic build-out of carpet, paint, and lighting, including equipment such as a photocopier and coffee machine costs about $40 a square foot, according to <a href="https://42floors.com/us/nv/las-vegas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42Floors</a>, a national search engine listing real estate for office space. On the higher end of the scale, a build-out with finishes such as wood veneer doors and a stone reception desk could hit $100 to $150 a square foot. The office renovation cost could also increase if you are renovating in an older building where quirky spaces and issues, such as slanted floors, must be taken into account. Whatever your tastes and needs, here are budget line items to consider.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs to hire an architect for an office renovation </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people will choose to hire an architect or designer. Expect that to take 20 percent of your renovation budget, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Carla</a>. That could mean $40,000 of a $200,000 budget. Bringing in a design professional early on may save heartaches in the long run. Along with the overall look and feel of the project, architects can also take care of code issues, assess if the workspace size will be comfortable for the number of employees, ensure handicap accessibility, design custom work areas, and more. “You can express creativity and individuality,” said Carla.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office lighting and electrical costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While planning an office remodel, first consider who will be coming to your office, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3218">Anthony, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. If clients are making regular visits, “you don’t want it to look like you’re working out of a bomb shelter,” he said. Decent lighting is one of those elements you can use to impress your clients, an impression that will hopefully lead to more business. Basic lighting can cost about $250 a point (a light with a switch is considered two points), according to Anthony. For each 110 volt outlet, put $150 in your budget, and don’t forget things like lighting for emergency exit signs, which are about $300 each, according to the website <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Move Your Office</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for millwork and finishes in an office</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is another area where you can keep costs down while still wowing potential clients with your new office space. “I’ve done work in lawyer&#8217;s offices where inside it is a vanilla box with cubicles that the clients never see,” said Anthony. “Then you have a lobby and conference room that is decked out with custom woodwork and imported marble.” One sample office budget at Buildings.com put the cost of millwork and finishes at about $25 a square foot. The total office renovation cost for that build-out came to $90 a square foot.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs to build walls</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similar to lighting and millwork, walls can differ greatly in cost. A basic partition wall that is ten linear square feet could cost around $60. Glass walls are not often priced per square foot and are instead sold as a package. However, using executive design elements such as glass walls could push the entire cost of your office renovation towards the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/64oqcghu49v4txd/Kirksey_ConstructionCostUpdate_2015_0.pdf?dl=0%20Paint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$150 </a>a square foot range.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office flooring costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commercial-grade carpet or a vinyl tile can cost <a href="https://naiglobal.com//journal_item_attachments/000/551/662/original/construction_costs.pdf?1421682262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as little</a> as $4 a square foot to supply and install. Wood plank floors can <a href="https://www.remodelingexpense.com/costs/cost-of-plank-flooring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost</a> around $7 a square foot for a 5,000-square-foot office. If there will be an industrial theme in your new office, then concrete flooring might be an economical option starting at $2 a square foot, according to the <a href="https://www.concretenetwork.com/concrete/interiorfloors/cost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concrete Network</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office bathroom costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many office buildings will have a communal bathroom area on each floor for tenants. If there is no bathroom, you must install at least one. <a href="https://americanrestroom.org/the-united-states-code-of-federal-regulations-for-toilet-facilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US code</a> requires one bathroom per one to 15 staff members. That climbs to six bathrooms for 111 to 150 staff.  A single restroom could cost a little under $15,000, according to <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Move Your Office</a>. If your staff likes to shower at work after jogging or riding into the office, a shower (make sure it is handicap friendly as per the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>), will cost just shy of $6,000.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office kitchen costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An office kitchen can help team members feel appreciated. In the office renovation cost outline at the end of this article, Sweeten contractor Anthony installed an office bathroom and kitchenette. The total budget for those two items was around $16,000. The kitchenette, which consisted of a sink and fridge, took about 25 percent or $4,000 of that budget. Because the kitchenette and the bathroom were near each other, the project made double use of the plumbing to reduce overall costs. “It really depends on how much plumbing and millwork you need,” said Anthony. “You could have a simple cabinet or a whole countertop with a microwave, fridge, and sink.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fire protection</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on the building you are leasing, this could (hopefully) already be in place. If there is a sprinkler system, it is well worth spending a few hundred dollars to have an engineer inspect it to ensure it works and that it is up to current code. Installing a system from scratch in a small to a medium-sized office could set you back between $5,000 to $10,000, according to Anthony. He estimates that a sprinkler system will cost about $200 per sprinkler head, plus an additional $2,000 to have a plan drawn up as well as permits and inspections.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HVAC for offices</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping an office well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature can have a big impact on employee productivity. So, installing an HVAC—heating ventilation and air conditioning system—might be worth it if there isn’t already one in your new location. An HVAC system could cost between $15 to almost $30 a square foot or 15 to 20 percent of your entire office renovation cost, according to the Builder’s Association.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Labor costs for an office remodel </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a typical office renovation, labor should take about <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ten percent</a> of your entire budget. However, consider the geographic differences in labor costs. For example, the cost of labor in New York City is 70 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/costs/kitchen-remodeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr</a>. Philadelphia is 40 percent and Dallas ten percent above the national average. Charleston, South Carolina, and Scottsdale, Arizona, are both one percent below the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certain factors in individual cities can add another variable. For example, in New York City, there are union and non-union buildings. For union buildings, tenants are required to use union labor, which can almost double the office renovation cost of a project, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. The basic build-out of an office in a non-labor building can be as little as $40 a square foot or as much as $100 a square foot in a labor building, according to <a href="https://42floors.com/edu/space-buildout/gauging-the-cost-of-an-office-build-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42Floors</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, a real budget for a 5,500 square-foot office renovation in NYC from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Paul</a>:</p>
