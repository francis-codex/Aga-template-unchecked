<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Homeowners:</strong> Geoffrey, an architect, and Alicia, who works in operations at a FinTech startup, posted their modern <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/123489#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room remodel</a> on Sweeten</li>
<li><strong>Where:</strong> Manhattan on Central Park South</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> An updated living room creates custom zones with millwork and additional walls in their one-bedroom apartment</li>
<li><strong>With:</strong> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Homeowner&#8217;s quote:</strong> &#8220;Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">An opportunity to invest in Central Park South</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the pandemic, we saw a lot of people giving up on New York, and thought it was the perfect time to double down. We drew a box around the southern half of Central Park and started searching. A lot of units had recently been taken off the market but we reached out to realtors to see if the sellers were still interested in making a move. We found our home in an ideal building and location, and made an offer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowners and their dog" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52587" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our 1,000-square-foot apartment is in an iconic mid-century building on Central Park South, which we felt offered us the best of all worlds. The Upper East and Upper West sides were easy to get to, and we love being able to spend our weekends alternating between the two.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A love of pre-war layouts</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the past, we’d always lived in pre-war buildings with architectural character and well-defined floor plans. You don’t get a lot of that in modern buildings like the mid-century one we landed in, so we created our own. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, and hired our general contractor. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg" alt="dining room and modern living room remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52579 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wouldn&#8217;t be adding molding, chair rail, or opening up the kitchen, which are so popular these days. Instead, our plan was to define the layout in discrete ways that would <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create separate zones</a>—a proper entry foyer, a generous space for dining, and a desk niche.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our apartment’s original living room was 13 feet across and more than 30 feet long, so we had plenty of space to work with. Our goal was to create a more intimate and purposeful space that could be used for entertaining as well as a dedicated workspace for those work-from-home days.</span></p>
<h3>Creating niches in a modern living room remodel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like most New Yorkers, this was all about maximizing the available square footage. We had an opportunity to divide the extra-large living space for different purposes. By adding a small wall near the entrance to the apartment, we created a foyer on one side and an office area on the other. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the living room, the focal point was a 14-foot wall with custom-designed millwork crafted from European white oak and marble. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/carrara-vs-calacatta-marble-what-is-the-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single slab of Carrara marble</a> houses an electric <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-remodel-on-the-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace</a> and a recessed TV. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg" alt="modern living room remodel with niche office desk" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52584 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">&#8220;[M]ake sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the winter, the apartment could feel a bit dreary (our courtyard views prevent us from getting a ton of natural light). Installing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/adding-fireplace-renovation-gas-wood-burning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace would turn up the cozy-dial</a>, and we designed the entire living space around that idea. We couldn’t do a real fireplace and weren’t interested in dealing with the hassle of gels or fuel logs. We chose a beautiful electric fireplace that was the most convincing artificial unit we could find.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The white oak used throughout the renovation featured strong horizontal lines echoing the building’s iconic mid-century exterior. The material also helped brighten up the space. Bump-outs of the walls near the window created a defined dining area. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Marble slab realities</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The single biggest issue during the renovation was with the large slab of Carrara marble that would clad the front of our fireplace and media wall. It was 7 feet tall and about 5 feet wide, and we insisted that it have mitered corners. We had no idea what an ordeal it would be—the mitered corners were fragile, and a slab that size was very unwieldy. Maneuvering it through the parking garage and up the freight elevator was a half-day exercise that culminated in hours of positioning, tweaking, and polishing. We were scared the entire time that this 500-pound piece of marble would break and we’d have to start all over!</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Align your budget and your expectations</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My advice to renovators? Really <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dig into the contractors</a> you’re interviewing. Make sure that you’re 100% sure that they can do the kind of work that you want, and make sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In terms of our budget, we did pretty well and came within <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1% of the projected cost</a>. It was about $35,000 including the fireplace. Overall, we couldn’t be happier. The space is doing <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything we wanted it to</a>, and we’re excited to cozy up in front of the “fire” this winter.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Plans include an open kitchen, new closets, oak floors, and embracing the “cons” of Carrara marble</h2>
<p><i>A search for a home to suit their growing family led Marissa and Cody from the West Village to a beautiful spot in northern Manhattan. The apartment, a two-bed, one-bath corner unit, was located on a steep hill in the neighborhood of Hudson Heights. (Fun fact: the building’s foundation sits on a lattice of 40-foot steel stilts!) It came with soaring views of the city, gorgeous light from its north- and east-facing windows, and felt “more like San Francisco than New York City.” The unit’s interior needed some updating, and Cody, an architect, was up to the task. </i><span class="s1"><i>Paired up with a contractor from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors,</i></span><span class="s1"><i> they </i></span><i>knocked down a wall closing in the galley kitchen to connect it to the living room<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>creating an open kitchen design<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>removed a nib wall, and made changes to the bath as well as the floors and closets throughout.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cody says</span>: </i></span>We had been renting a one-bedroom apartment in the West Village for seven years. We started looking to buy an apartment when Marissa became pregnant, and homed in on northern Manhattan to give her a reasonable commute to Columbia University (we had ruled out several neighborhoods in Brooklyn for this reason). Our first impression of Hudson Heights was that it felt like a small village tucked away in the city, surrounded by amazing views and parks. We visited on a snowy winter day, and saw a cross-country skier in the middle of the street!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We continued to look more seriously after our daughter, Lucia, was born, and finally closed on an apartment in March 2016: a two-bed, one-bath, 1,000-square-foot apartment in a 1960s co-op building. Though the postwar construction did not have some of the Art Deco, prewar detailing that is typical of the neighborhood, it did lend itself to a simple and logical floor plan and had thru-wall air conditioning units<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>allowing in even more light than apartments we saw with window units.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marissa says</span>:</i></span> Cody is an architect, and we wanted something we could renovate and make our own. While continuing to live in our West Village apartment, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6369" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> to Sweeten and went with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten contractor</a> who was professional, communicative, and direct. The renovation took eight weeks (two weeks under the projected schedule the contractor proposed!), and we moved in just after he finished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of our overall vision, first and foremost we wanted to join the kitchen to the living space. We hoped to make the apartment feel open, light, and modern, but warm and homey at the same time. We were drawn to a clean and minimal palette, especially in the kitchen. Cody is an avid home cook, and we knew the kitchen would be the heart of the home. We maximized where we could—for example, with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/refrigerator-chill-world-fridge-freezer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">36-inch wide refrigerator</a>, five-burner range, 23-inch stainless steel undermount sink. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">six-foot island</a> is our home base, the place where we naturally gravitate throughout the day or when we have friends over.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-26-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26378 size-chrono" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-26-1-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26360 mb-0 size-chrono" title="shelves for cookbooks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On a related note, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-kitchen-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA kitchen</a> cabinet system is amazing for the price point. There are an infinite number of modular configurations and we achieved a result that is nearly indistinguishable from a custom kitchen. The upper cabinets are 40 inches tall and extend to the ceiling, allowing for tons of storage (we never thought we would have empty shelves while living in NYC!). It was important for us to use “real” materials like stone and wood to accent specific moments. For example, we selected the white <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carrara marble</a> knowing full well it would take a beating. We loved the idea that every scratch, etch, and stain will continue to give it character over time.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26361 mb-0 size-chrono" title="view from the kitchen into the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given that an open kitchen design and living area was our primary goal, the first question we asked ourselves when viewing a potential apartment was: “Can we connect the kitchen to the living space?” The existing kitchen in our apartment was a long and narrow galley. Knocking down the wall allowed us to redesign the entire room, maximizing storage and functionality while linking the main living spaces. It also made the room much brighter<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>the window in the kitchen brings in tons more light to the living and dining room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedrooms, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinished</a> the floors with a lighter and more natural oak. We love how they seem to brighten up both spaces now. We also redid the closets in both rooms; in the master bedroom we were able to do the floor-to-ceiling pivot hinges, just like in the living space, but in Lucia&#8217;s room a beam prevented us from doing the same. We were still able to reframe her closet and maximize storage with a new shelving system. We also bought very minimal ceiling light fixtures for each room, which blend in while providing extra ambient light. All of that, plus the square-stock baseboards and door casings, really spruced up both rooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26362 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26363 size-chrono" title="master bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-24-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-25.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26364 mb-0 size-chrono" title="master bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-25-723x1085.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also eliminated a small nib wall in the living room that separated the front living space from the bedrooms in the back of the apartment. With the nib wall gone, there is a direct line of sight to the windows in Lucia’s bedroom, which brightens the entire apartment and creates a feeling of spaciousness.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26367 size-chrono" title="office nook" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26426 mb-0 size-chrono" title="closets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Outside of the kitchen and living room project, we also saw the opportunity to reframe the closets throughout the apartment, remove the existing sliding bypass closet doors, and replace them with floor-to-ceiling pivot hinged doors. This created ample storage, and the verticality of the doors and their accompanying hardware became a design feature consistent in every room. The reconfiguration that resulted in an open kitchen design also allowed us to create a new hallway linen closet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We made a few changes to the bathroom which made a big difference in the final look. We replaced the pedestal sink for a wall mounted <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> which created a lot more storage, replaced the old shower bypass glass doors with a fixed glass panel, and gave it a fresh coat of gray paint. We kept the tiles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting fixtures,</a> and towel racks from the previous design.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26370 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26371 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most surprising moment of the whole process was when our contractor sent us some photos after the first day of demolition. There was a huge pile of debris in the middle of the apartment, and a raw opening between the kitchen and living room and around each closet. Beams, columns, electrical conduit, and wiring were totally exposed. It was a shock to realize how much work we were really putting into the renovation. There was no turning back, and we could only hope that all the planning and design preparation going into the project would work out. Eight weeks later, it was a finished project and we could not have been happier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We can’t recommend our Sweeten contractor enough. Although his <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bid</a> was slightly higher than the others we received, we immediately got the sense that he would deliver a high-quality product, not exceed his budget, and stick to his schedule. All of this turned out to be accurate. We felt most comfortable with him from day one. He and Cody collaborated extensively throughout the renovation, and had a clear line of communication. He did not disappoint us in any respect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s important to remember that there are many unknowns in the renovation process, and many pieces that are out of your control. Until we knocked down the wall between the living room and kitchen, we did not know for certain what would be behind it. (We had done a small probe to look for pipes, and based on the short span, we assumed that there were not any structural elements.) We couldn’t know for sure the location of the plumbing and gas risers until demolition was complete, which would ultimately dictate where we placed the kitchen sink and oven. It turned out that the gas riser was floating off the perimeter wall by almost 24 inches, and we had initially assumed it would be right along the perimeter wall. As a result, the opening to the kitchen had to be cut short. Although it was initially a disappointment, we used the 24-inch wall as an opportunity to put in a small cabinet and countertop, with wooden shelves above. It ended up being a great addition to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open kitchen design</a>, even though we hadn’t anticipated it!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26379 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our advice to future renovators: make your design choices ahead of time and stick to them. You don’t want to be redesigning in the middle of construction. If there are any surprises during construction (like the location of a gas riser<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>see above), it is critical to make a thoughtful yet quick decision and keep moving forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are so happy with the apartment. It turned out just as we had envisioned it, and it’s been great to have so much space! We had been living in a 600-square-foot one-bedroom for Lucia’s first year, and by the time we moved out, we were feeling very cramped. Now, we’re expecting our second baby, and it feels like there is plenty of room to grow. But if the day comes when we do need more space and we start looking for our next renovation project, we’ll certainly use Sweeten again!</p>
<p><i>What a thoughtful and beautiful redesign, Cody! Thanks to you, Marissa, and Lucia for a glimpse into your home. </i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week&#8217;s Before and After brings a little Christmas-in-July cheer for a family of three in Brooklyn&#8217;s Columbia Waterfront District. Robyn, Alejandro, and their daughter Bianca stopped by a cavernous, dark two-bedroom condo on Christmas Eve, hoping the new year might bring a new home for their family. What they found was an apartment in total disrepair &#8211; more than a little TLC would be required to update the space, but the square footage and bustling location seemed promising. Robyn and Alejandro prepared for everything short of moving walls and came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> with a long list of updates needed in every room. The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photos on their project post</a>, all taken while the place was still on the market, make it hard to imagine what a renovation could do, but Robyn saw potential for a more open, chef&#8217;s industrial kitchen. To make it all happen in time for summer, we matched Robyn&#8217;s vision with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a> &#8211; a veteran design and custom cabinetry duo and the team behind <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/claire-mikes-park-slope-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claire and Mike&#8217;s beautiful Park Slope kitchen</a>, which Robyn threw in as inspiration in her planning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-with-gray-cabinets-and-chalkboard" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47830 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Bathroom.jpg" alt="small kitchen with gray cabinets and stainless steel appliances and large chalkboard on wall and pendant light and built-in book shelves in the hallway after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Bathroom.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Bathroom-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Bathroom-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span id="more-13517"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original kitchen felt almost like a kitchenette: the most functional fixtures and appliances were jammed up against the back wall with just a foot or so of counter space to spare on one side, and the kitchen was hemmed in by an old fridge and a partial wall. Even in a space twice its size, the conditions of the cabinets, flooring, and countertops were total deal breakers. Clearly, all of it had to go. Robyn brought a strong guiding sense of function to the project and decided early on that the new kitchen would be oriented around a few major appliances: a <a href="https://www.vikingrange.com/consumer/category/products/cooking;jsessionid=ZnTEB-gEGHU0WPVtbC6XIA**.node2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking range</a> and a farmhouse sink topped the list of dream pieces. Robyn and Alejandro hit their stride with Paulina as they thought through ways to bring in more light and make the most of the kitchen&#8217;s layout, and they drew up plans to focus workspace around the range, split food prep and clean up tasks on opposite sides, and replace peeling laminate counters and cabinets with quality finishes that reflected the family&#8217;s focus on cooking and eating together.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Paulina and Albert&#8217;s team got down to business, ripping out everything in sight and removing the kitchen&#8217;s entry wall dividers. From top to bottom, here is Robyn&#8217;s rundown of the fixtures and finishes that now fill this family&#8217;s beautiful kitchen!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Floors</strong> &#8211; Robyn opted to forego tiling and extend the living room&#8217;s re-surfaced and re-stained oak floors into the kitchen. Paulina and Albert were able to match a new section of wood seamlessly using a light stain with a hint of gray to neutralize the space and complement the cool color palette that Robyn was assembling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cabinets</strong> &#8211; Paulina helped Robyn stay away from a white kitchen with painted gray, Shaker-style cabinets. Paulina&#8217;s design added paneling along the outer edges to elegantly frame the room, and Albert created slim toe-kick drawers for an additional layer of storage. Paulina stowed a generous row of outlets along the cabinets&#8217; underside with a strip of LED lighting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Countertop</strong> &#8211; The couple selected a granite stone cut with gray undertones and luminous purple specks that brings the durability of granite with a look that more closely approximates marble veining.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Backsplash</strong> &#8211; Robyn found a stainless steel tile that nods to the neighborhood&#8217;s industrial shipping past and present. Paulina extended the tiles beyond the point of a traditional backsplash, lining the kitchen&#8217;s central wall and framing the kid-friendly (and spouse-friendly!) chalkboard wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen&#8217;s starring features, that sparkling Viking range and <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/browse/kitchen-kitchen-sinks/_/N-25b4Z1z13vf8?id1=www.kohler.com/apronfront/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler apron front sink</a>, take center stage on each side of the kitchen, with ample work and storage space flanking both. The family added a <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/cooling/refrigeration/all-refrigeration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel fridge</a> and a narrow width <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/products/dishwashers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch dishwasher</a> &#8211; two high-impact but trim footprint pieces used every day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Robyn and Alejandro&#8217;s kitchen was just the start of this condo&#8217;s full renovation. We&#8217;ll check back with this sweet family for a full tour of the rest of their home before the summer is up!</p>
