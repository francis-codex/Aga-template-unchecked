</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner, Samantha</i></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We bought what was essentially a flip and closed on it the month before our oldest daughter, </span><span class="s1">now almost seven, arrived. We finished the buildout that became her bedroom the night before her birth. The apartment’s finishes weren&#8217;t our favorite, but we had our own place, and were a family. I’ve been a stay-at-home mom (with a creative-industry résumé); Jameson is a partner and the digital director at Athletics, a Brooklyn-based creative studio.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47279 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Outgrowing a home they love</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After having our second daughter nearly four years ago, we knew the apartment needed to change. </span><span class="s5">We </span><span class="s1">loved its location in the Clinton Hill Co-Ops and our hope was to extend our time in this place and the neighborhood. Our growing daughters needed room more than ever, and we wanted to overhaul our kitchen and bathroom. It was time</span><span class="s5"> to make this home more liveable for our family.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and began our search for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/truth-design-build-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a design-build firm</a>. We wanted someone who could help make our space bright and modern, nodding to both Midcentury and California design. Time was tight—we were looking to renovate during our kids’ summer break and move back in before school resumed—and when we weren’t excited about any of the contractors we were initially matched with, Sweeten quickly presented more options, including some who’d worked in our co-ops. That sold us. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47275 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Kitchen-Storage-5.gif" alt="toe kick storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<h3>The kitchen kicks off the apartment renovation</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I’m a big cook, and it was top-of-the-list for me that our kitchen renovation was as functional as possible. Secondary, but non-negotiable: We wanted the whole apartment to be social, conducive to entertaining, and hanging out. We realized that opening the kitchen to the living room could help us achieve both goals, letting me see my family in the living room while I’m in the kitchen cooking. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The dining area, previously over by the window, flip-flopped with the living room sofa, to make the table easily reachable. We also added a breakfast counter within the cutout, letting me interact with the girls while they eat breakfast or do homework and unload about the day. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The new kitchen is a pleasure to work in. We chose top-of-the-line appliances and built in the refrigerator, creating a giant cabinet above it. There was other storage, too, to house the accessories I’d collected. Wide, shallow drawers installed by our contractor in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/unique-features-for-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinet kickplates give me an awesome</a> place to store my serving pieces and cast-iron pans. Our color palette was basic with matte white and rift-oak cabinetry and black accents. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldn’t be afraid to ask for what I wanted.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Kid-friendly soundproofing for bedroom doors</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Previously, our daughters’ shared bedroom had French doors opening to the living and dining room; they weren’t soundproof, so when the kids went to bed at 8pm, Jameson and I felt like we had to retire to our bedroom. With the new layout and the kitchen opening to the bedrooms, we <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/soundproof-your-room-or-apartment-4062945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">installed a sound-blocking pocket door</a> for the girls’ room. Now we can have company over or stay up late watching television or listening to music, never worrying we’ll wake them. </span></p>

<h3>Flooring idea: Terrazzo</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Another high-quality splurge was on the eco-friendly terrazzo flooring for the kitchen. I’ve always loved the style as a component of Midcentury modernism. This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldn’t <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">be afraid to ask for what I wanted</a>. We still came in under budget for both renovation and furniture.</span></p>
<h3>A bath refresh in navy and brass</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While we decided against a full reno of our bathroom, some improvements were made, adding style and storage without gutting it. The room was done in basic black and white, so when I found the navy blue and brass vanity cabinet, I thought it would add visual interest. The old, space-wasting pedestal sink was replaced with a smaller basin and the drawered unit. The black light fixture and shower-curtain rod match hardware in other rooms—we updated the doorknobs and fixtures throughout the place, and it made a huge visual impact.</span></p>
<h3>Sweeten contractor completes punch list</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My favorite part of the project was moving back in. Our new home is a joy! We had all of the art we’ve collected over the years professionally framed and hung. We achieved our objective of making our home feel worldly, warm, and timeless. After the project wrapped, our contractor even came back a few times to complete punch-list items and handle touch-ups. I love all of the finished elements. It makes me happy to come home, and we all love spending time here, comfortable, at ease, just hanging out in a place we truly love. </span></p>

<h3>Change in scenery</h3>
<p>Hudson Heights is a veritable small town in the big city. Chris and I moved to the neighborhood from the Upper West Side when we started our family. We stumbled across it after a bike ride up the west side bike path to the Cloisters, and it felt like no other neighborhood in the city—quiet, beautiful, on top of a hill overlooking the Hudson River, yet it still had everything that makes New York City such a special and diverse place to live. And the housing market offered more space for our money, so that was also appealing.</p>

<p>We bought a one-bedroom apartment, had three children, and found a home in this amazing neighborhood and community. Fast forward to nine years later, and Chris was offered a position in the California Bay Area. We were incredibly sad to leave Hudson Heights, but we had outgrown our one-bedroom apartment and knew a change was inevitable.</p>
<h3>Back to the beginning</h3>
<p>We spent two wonderful, adventure-filled years in California, but our old neighborhood, city, and home in New York City were always calling us back. When an opportunity came up for Chris to move to a team here, we knew it was meant to be. We immediately started looking for a home in Hudson Heights, and after many months of searching, the listing for this apartment appeared. It was the perfect space for our family. After so many years of uncertainty and bouncing around, we finally felt like we found a home to settle down in.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40958 size-full" title="open kitchen and dining space" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg" alt="open kitchen and dining space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment—a 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bath co-op in a post-war, 1950s building—was all in its original condition, except for a replaced refrigerator. Even the metal cabinets stuck together with paint and the linoleum kitchen floors were still intact. Thankfully, our budget allowed us to factor in a renovation, but we had never done anything like this before, not even in the old one-bedroom that we owned. Just thinking about being able to make a home specific to our taste and design was so exciting.</p>
<h3>Scoping out work for the renovation</h3>
<p>We wanted to update everything. Our hope was for a bright and airy home that looked modern and clean. I spent many late nights scouring <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/sweetenhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest</a>, so we knew what we liked and had an idea of ways to achieve that using certain colors, materials, and furniture, but we were still completely overwhelmed with choices of materials, where to get them, and how to stay within our budget.</p>

<h3>A floor to match the aesthetic</h3>
<p>Our Sweeten design-build team guided us through all of that, suggesting brands, vendors, and materials to achieve our overall look. Thinking about our budget, I was definitely on the fence about where to spend and where to save, and I even waffled on whether we should get new floors. I thought the parquet floors held up well enough and still looked beautiful, but since we were going for a different modern look, we decided to redo the floors. I have to say, I am so glad we did because it completely changed the whole feel of the space.</p>

<h3>Letting the design-team lead</h3>
<p>Overall, our design-build team was awesome. When we met, they were professional, listened to and understood our vision, and also offered wonderful ideas we hadn’t thought of. It felt like their excitement for the project was mutual. And as we were first-time renovators, they were so great and helpful walking us through each step. They were constantly offering suggestions telling us what works and what doesn’t, always steering us in the right direction. <span style="color: #333333;">Our biggest question was, “Would you please hold our hand throughout this whole process because we do not know what the heck we are doing!”.</span></p>

<h3>Shifting the floor plan</h3>
<p>The kitchen needed the most improvement. In our previous homes, we always had wall-facing counters or a separate kitchen away from the living space, so entertaining was always a challenge or just had a difficult flow. With that in mind, we decided to partially open up the existing kitchen wall to create a two-sided counter with an area for stools on the other side where the kids or guests can sit.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40959 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-03.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula " width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>We also shifted the floor plan a little, pushing out the wall between the kitchen and the living room to widen the galley. We told our design-build team our vision, and they helped us figure out the best way to do that given the space and structure of the apartment.</p>
<h3>Versatility in the kitchen</h3>
<p>It is now so much easier when the kids want to help us in the kitchen. There is definitely a lot less pushing and arguing for space and for who gets to sit on a random chair we used to pull up to the counter. <span style="color: #333333;">Pancake mornings are more zen now that everyone has their own stool to sit on to help.</span></p>

<p>I think if you asked Chris what he was the most excited about, it would be the built-in desk and cabinet space. We were able to work with our design-build team to create an organized drawer and cabinet system for our work and creative space, as well as a system for the constant flow of kids’ schoolwork, art supplies, and collections.</p>
<h3>A modern update</h3>
<p>In the dining room, we got a new light fixture for over the table, but we saved the original 1950s art deco chandelier that had hung over the original dining area and decided to shine it up and use it as a fixture in the girls&#8217; bedroom. They love it and it definitely makes for a fancy splash of fun in that room.</p>

<h3>A bathroom that fits just right</h3>
<p>For the bathroom, which is tiny, we had a barn door put on instead of having a door that opens into the bathroom, making the space even tighter.</p>

<h3>More room, more convenient</h3>
<p>Our design-build team also suggested the double doors for closets throughout the apartment in place of a single door. Our son plays the drums so having a wider entry opening was helpful. The double doors took up the least amount of space when opened and allowed for more wiggle room with our furniture. It made a world of difference.</p>

<h3>Plan for the &#8216;just-in-case&#8217;</h3>
<p>With any major project like this one, there will always be hiccups. Whether it be with the schedule, or with finding pipes in the wall you didn’t know were there, or with materials that you did not account for in the budget. Our advice to future renovators: Plan accordingly, but also maybe plan for &#8220;just-in-case.&#8221; Give yourself a buffer for scheduling and for budget, if you are able. It will most likely be needed.</p>
<p>We certainly needed it. We were renting elsewhere on a one-year lease, and when we bought the unit, we only had a few months left to go on our lease. So we were eager to get the ball rolling. The contractors gave us a clear schedule that aligned with the end of our lease, perfectly. There were some unforeseen hiccups around approvals and it could have taken much longer if it weren’t for our contractor and design team always going to bat for us and making necessary calls and contacting the powers that be to make sure things moved along at a faster pace.</p>

<h3>Working with remodeling hiccups</h3>
<p>Because of slow approvals, the schedule did get pushed back a few weeks. Our time renting had ended and we had to be out. But the project was still very much in the throes of construction, so we ended up staying at an extended-stay suite in the neighborhood directly across the bridge from us in New Jersey! We were carpooling back and forth over the George Washington Bridge for work and school—a traffic nightmare. Our contractor was very understanding and sympathetic to our needs, so he doubled his team and had everyone finishing up the place at top speed. And even if my kids did appreciate the free cookies at the hotel counter every day, we were thrilled to finally be in our finished apartment after a week in the hotel.</p>
<p>Looking back on it all, our newly renovated home makes us feel super grateful—grateful for having the ability to make the changes we wanted and grateful we found such a great team to help and make those changes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Marsha and Adam searched long and hard for almost two years before they found the townhouse that would become their family home in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The pair—she, the CFO of a division at Siemens, and he, a manager of software development at Spotify—looked all over the borough, and even ventured into New Jersey before realizing that Brooklyn was where they needed to be. They found a brick two-family home that needed a lot of work, but the couple had a good feeling about it. It was “sunny, just the right size, and of course, within our budget,” says Marsha. Having lived for a while in a 720-square-foot Park Slope apartment with their two daughters, Sophie and Mila, they were excited for all the new space—just over 2,000 square feet on three floors, plus a basement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While the duo knew that they needed to gut the townhouse, the renovation and total timeline stretched across a year and a half. They moved into the home in the summer of 2015, pre-renovation, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors. They were matched with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect</a>, who worked with them on the plans for the renovation lasting close to a year. (A possible relocation to North Carolina for work delayed the project for three months, just as construction was about to commence.) Once the demolition began, the family of four moved into the garden apartment and camped out there for about half a year, until the work in the upstairs duplex was completed in December 2016.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The first must-have on the couple’s list was white oak floors. The rest of the design took inspiration from the simplicity of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardwood</a>. For the kitchen, Marsha and Adam decided on an all-white color palette, an unfussy, modern look inspired while scouring Pinterest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the main floor of the duplex (the second floor of the house), the couple knocked down the walls that chopped up the spaces, so that the living room, dining space, and kitchen were all connected as one open room. A hallway, which took up precious space, was removed, while a full bath was converted to a powder room (with a fun <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patterned tile floor</a>!) all to give more square footage to the kitchen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Working within a limited amount of space, their Sweeten architect came up with two solutions that would maximize the function and beauty of the kitchen, which faced the back of the house. She suggested that they add another window to the rear wall, and remove a non-functioning fireplace that was causing an awkward flow. The revised layout featured an L-shaped white Caesarstone countertop and white ceiling-height Shaker-style cabinets, as well as a new island. A large <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen pantry</a> held the recycling and appliances from view. A marble hex-tile backsplash added some variation while furthering the theme of modern simplicity. Three simple wood-clad steps lead to a deck and down to the backyard.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Each of the three bedrooms were <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/skim-coating-in-5-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coated</a> and painted in Benjamin Moore Super White, a perfect backdrop to the pops of color that the girls added to their rooms. The resulting home is modern yet warm and allows the couple’s mid-century modern-inspired furnishings, lighting, and art to take center stage.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-23.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29904 size-chrono" title="hallway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-23-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation Brooklyn" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-18.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29903 mb-0 size-chrono" title="washer/dryer closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-18.gif" alt="renovation Brooklyn" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the top floor of the duplex, the floor plan remained mostly the same, with a few minor changes. The hallway was widened for a more spacious feel. The two smaller bedrooms were evened out so that both Sophie and Mila would have similarly-sized rooms, and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer/dryer closet</a> was created so that they wouldn’t have to “schlep laundry up and down the stairs.” The original staircases were in terrible condition and a priority to be replaced. They now feature clean vertical lines—white posts framed by straight wooden rails that echo the white oak floors.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29906 size-chrono" title="basement landing" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation Brooklyn" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Marsha and Adam have put away the paint cans, they reflected on what was most difficult about the renovation: “The biggest challenge was living in a construction zone for five months,&#8221; the couple agrees. &#8220;It was tight, dusty, and messy. But it was a great way to keep track of the progress and make sure everything was being done as we expected. [Another] challenge was keeping our wish list reasonable. It is so easy to spiral out of control and decide you want every square inch renovated.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They were glad to have a Sweeten architect by their side. “The team was pleasant and easy to work with. I still can&#8217;t believe how great our experience was considering we were gutting our house. The key is communication, and we all worked very well together. Our advice is to find people who are easy to communicate with, and who have worked together in the past. When people know each other, they can more easily deal with issues that come up.” What do they love most about their new home? For Marsha, it was the sunny kitchen and backyard. And according to the children: all of it. &#8220;I think they truly love the house,&#8221; says their mother.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, they also wanted to share this nugget of wisdom: “Paying more for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproofing</a> the bathroom (so you don&#8217;t hear anything from your bedroom) is worth every penny. We really appreciated our Sweeten architect telling us that we ‘needed’ those more expensive items—she was right.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re back in Brooklyn for round two of Chris and Amber’s home renovation! Last week, Chris shared a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/chris-and-ambers-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">detailed account of their lovely kitchen renovation</a>, and this week we’re lucky enough to get another tour featuring two vitally important areas of their Ditmas Park home. Read on for a new take on how they made way for a second bedroom and squeezed in a full bathroom renovation, all just in time to welcome a new baby!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/chris-ambers-bathroom-kids-room-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17257" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/amber-bathroom.jpg" alt="ditmas park bathroom renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/amber-bathroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/amber-bathroom-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
Guest post by Chris, Ditmas Park homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During construction, many people, not least of all our immediate neighbors, asked us why we were renovating our apartment. In the earliest stages, we would say, semi-seriously, that all we had really intended to do before things got out of control was put in a dishwasher. We had quickly realized that re-doing our kitchen was going to be an all or nothing endeavor for us and putting in a dishwasher somehow became ripping our kitchen down to bare studs. But once we found out that our second kid was on the way, the focus of the project became carving out a room for our older son that was just big enough to be useful, but small enough to keep the kitchen a reasonable size. After <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting our project on Sweeten</a> and meeting <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these Sweeten general contractors</a>, we went full steam ahead with their innovative design for our kitchen and new kids&#8217; room.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17271 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17258" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten general contractors understood that we needed to be able to fit a standard-sized crib along one of the crved walls, and that if push came to shove we could alternatively squeeze in a standard twin bed running the other way, just in case we end up staying in the apartment for quite a while longer than we’ve planned. We kept the curved walls of the room as they were since it is a nice pre-war touch that conveys the fact that the room juts out into the facade of the building, forming a miniature bay window with a tiny balcony for plants. We laid a new wood floor and installed a heavy door that swings open to be flush against the wall outside the room, almost making it disappear when it’s open. The other thing that makes it feel so much bigger is that there is a full transom milk glass window along the top of the doorway. It brings light into the kitchen and keeps the partition between the kitchen and our son’s room from dominating.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17184" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-13-14.gif" alt="kids room" width="600" height="401" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We only finished the last details of our son’s room a couple months ago: a series of picture shelves from Pottery Barn that we painted to match the walls, a roller blind, and a cheap but cheerful rug from Land of Nod. Honestly, it was knowing that Sweeten was sending a photographer that made us pull it all together!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Halfway through renovating the kitchen, we realized that if we didn’t do the bathroom, it was never going to happen. Our apartment and our lives had already been turned upside down and we knew we were never going to go through it again. The former bathroom had tiling that ran up the sides of the walls which created a tub effect and everything felt very tired and shabby.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We installed large dark gray tiles, replaced the old tub with a Kohler cast iron model, and redid the shower stall which is separate from the bath in clean simple narrow subway tiles from Nemo. The sink and vanity are from IKEA. We raised the ceiling of the stall and installed a ceiling light which makes all the difference. All the fixtures are Grohe, good bang for the buck and they toe the line between modern and classic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17252 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-02-1.jpg" alt="walk-in shower" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-02-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-02-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17251" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-01-1.jpg" alt="all-white bathroom remodel" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-01-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every project ends with a few things that you never quite get to and our wall light in the bathroom is one of them. We kept it in the original spot which is centered on the wall but not over the medicine cabinet. Our contractor was happy to move it but in our hurry to move back in with a two-week-old baby we figured we could live with it. Even now, every time I flip on the light I think of how amazing it felt to be back in the apartment after the work was done, so, I am happy to leave it where it is.</p>
