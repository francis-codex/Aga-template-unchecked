<p>When deciding whether to renovate your home, many aspects are considered. Having your <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget and scope aligned</a> and how to best <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/common-renovation-delays-how-to-prepare-for-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manage and prepare for delays</a> are top questions.</p>
<p>Another concern is finding the right renovation partner to help guide through the process and execute the vision. Here, three Sweeten renovators had these exact thoughts. They wanted their new space to match their life and design style. They wanted a trusted professional to do the job. And they needed it done sooner rather than later. They turned to Sweeten to find their contractors and get their projects moving.</p>

<h3>A Bronx Home Transforms into a Home, Sweet, Rental</h3>

<h4>The kitchen takes center stage</h4>
<p>Sally’s house, an attached, two-family home in the Bronx, had been in her family since it was originally built in 1993. She occupied the top-floor apartment while her sister and her family lived below. As co-owners of the 2,700-square-foot home, the siblings wanted to renovate but would do it slowly in parts based on their budget. However, Sally had decided to move out so her apartment was bumped to the top of their renovation list. The space would be updated to attract renters. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/107182#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their kitchen renovation project</a> on Sweeten and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/7019#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired their Sweeten general contractor.</a></p>
<p>They decided to tackle the most popular space in any home: the kitchen. People are naturally drawn to a kitchen and love spending time there with family and friends. So Sally knew that upgrading her existing outdated kitchen would make the whole apartment more enticing to renters. She wanted to open up the area to make it appear larger and add more storage. She knew this would also increase the functionality of the space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="beige-kitchen-cabinets-and-white-floor-tiles" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Before-03.jpg" alt="Beige kitchen closed cabinets over white tile flooring before renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51425" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Before-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Before-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Before-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="light-gray-kitchen-with-gray-backplash" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="Light gray kitchen with gray backsplash along with closed cabinet and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51650" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The design would be simple—and create a space that was easy to maintain. She consulted with her contractor on materials that would keep her within her budget. The contractor removed a half-wall that was in between the kitchen and living space, added plumbing, and removed unnecessary beams. The space is now completely open. Aesthetically speaking, gray was the deciding color palette for the cabinetry, appliances, and backsplash. The result is a neutral, contemporary kitchen that is pleasing to all tastes and styles.</p>
<h4>Sally&#8217;s Sweeten contractor goes above and beyond</h4>
<p>Sally relied heavily on her Sweeten contractor throughout the process. He introduced her to a designer who helped Sally move her vision forward. He also made frequent trips to the home improvement store helping Sally search and purchase backsplash tiles that weren&#8217;t on the original list of materials.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="light-gray-kitchen-cabinets-with-gray-countertop" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-08.jpg" alt="Light gray kitchen cabinets with gray countertop along a gray backsplash and small sink after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51655" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/107182-Sally-Kitchen-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p>Thankfully, Sally described the kitchen renovation as uneventful. “The crew came in, did their jobs, and went home,” said Sally. “They were all very professional and came to my house to work.” And she can’t decide on just one aspect of the design that’s her favorite. She loves it all—from the storage space to the color and the functionality.</p>

<h3>A Fort Greene Condo Shows Off Chic Black Renovation Materials</h3>

<h4>The bath gets an upgrade</h4>
<p>For Jesse and his partner Malik, their renovation came out of necessity. Their 934-square-foot condo in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, was water damaged. They needed to fix it—and quickly. “We were very concerned about drying out the place, getting the demolition completed, and covering the ‘basics,’” said Jesse. They interviewed a half-dozen contractors on their own. The couple also <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/37029#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> on Sweeten and a helpful assist with comparing all of the estimates led to the decision <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to hire this Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p>Jesse and Malik lived in the apartment for 10 years before the water damage so they wanted to take advantage of some improvements. And not just rip and replace what was originally there. For the bathroom, they added a pocket door, which was helpful to make the best use of the space. A niche was created for storage. For the shower, half of a wall was removed and a hand shower was added. The final result was a mix of contemporary forms with convenient functionalities.</p>

<h4>A bold and dramatic kitchen transformation</h4>
<p>The look for the kitchen would be decidedly contemporary. Inspired by a photo of a kitchen with a matte black palette, the couple set out to put their own spin on it. Adding to the dramatic palette, a quartzite slab countertop from Brazil had some delays but was well worth the wait. “The stone really brings so much movement to the space,” said Jesse.</p>
<p>Despite eye-catching countertops, the cabinets were not overshadowed. The couple hired a millworker—recommended by their Sweeten contractor—who made custom cabinets. The best part? They are maple plywood with a “traceless” ultra-matte finish, which translates to fewer fingerprints. And perhaps the couple&#8217;s favorite feature of the kitchen is the waterfall peninsula. “It’s a great finishing touch,” said Jesse.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="black-kitchen-cabinets-with-kitchen-island" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/37029-Jesse-Kitchen-3.jpg" alt="Black kitchen cabinets with kitchen island and recessed light fixtures after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51645" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/37029-Jesse-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/37029-Jesse-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/37029-Jesse-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Jesse and Malik found their Sweeten contractor to be a flexible partner <span class="s1">throughout the process, offering useful feedback and working through the issues when they came up. </span>“He understood from the start that we had a certain vision for the outcome,” said Jesse. “And he steered us to ensure we wouldn’t be disappointed.” The couple just loves that their new space “suits us and our style.”</p>

<h3>A Tub-to-Shower Swap Shines in a Chicago Bathroom</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="man-sitting-on-a-white-couch" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/108977-Jonathan-Bath-07.jpg" alt="Man sitting on a white couch" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51665" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/108977-Jonathan-Bath-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/108977-Jonathan-Bath-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/108977-Jonathan-Bath-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For Jonathan, a CPA and CIA, redoing his bathroom was a must. When he bought his 720-square-foot condo located in the River North section of Chicago, he knew it needed repair. But after a year of living with the outdated bathroom, he decided it was time to pull the trigger on a renovation and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/108977#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post his project</a> on Sweeten.</p>
<p>Jonathan <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6168#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired a Sweeten general contractor</a> in his area and the work began. At first, Jonathan only intended to rip out the bathtub and replace it with a standing shower. However, his friends convinced him otherwise. They suggested that since he hired a contractor, he might as well replace more than just the tub. Jonathan agreed and decided to give the bathroom an added refresh by upgrading the tiles in the shower wall and floor as well.</p>

<h4>A subtle but satisfying change</h4>
<p>Jonathan&#8217;s biggest question he needed advice on: What do I need to buy? For this, he turned to his general contractor who guided him on each of the materials he would need and the quantity.</p>
<p>The change was not drastic but it was one that satisfied Jonathan’s wish: to have an open shower look with only a glass divide—no door, no tub. The tiles on the shower wall are large-format, which visually expands a space. They are typically chosen for their modern vibe and clean aesthetic. To add texture and pattern, a gray hexagonal mosaic for the shower floor was brought into the mix. Mosaic tiles are not only pleasing to the eye but serve a functional purpose. Small tiles require more grout creating a non-slip surface.</p>
<p>Jonathan is happy with the way the project turned out. “I love that I can walk in my shower,” said Jonathan. “And it looks pretty!” It has gotten him thinking about future renovations. “I still have a few more projects in the pipeline!”</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45239" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OrderingMaterial-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OrderingMaterial-1-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OrderingMaterial-1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OrderingMaterial-1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every homeowner wants their home remodeling project to be finished by a specified date and on (or under) budget. For example, a basement remodel that is contractually expected to be finished by Christmas for visiting relatives, must be done by the specified date. Yet, it is not uncommon for homeowners to wonder why the project isn’t following the schedule or if the job will finish on time. <strong>How can homeowners (or contractors) keep a project on schedule, while also saving money during remodeling? </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten </a></span><span class="s1">highlights one part of the process that both parties have relative control over to help keep the project on schedule. The<strong> logistics of ordering materials,</strong> including <strong>selection</strong>, <strong>payment</strong>, and <strong>delivery</strong>, is one area that both homeowners and contractors agree upon as being vital to that common goal. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Mythbuster: Contractors want a project to go on and on</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing that might surprise homeowners starting a project is that the contractor is equally or even <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/qa-with-jean-general-contractor-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more anxious to keep the project on track</a>. This is because a smoothly running project means that the contractor can keep the client happy and within budget. Plus, this allows the contractor to successfully manage concurrent projects or move onto the next project on time.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Who does the ordering: contractor or homeowner?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before anything else happens, draw up a contract which both the homeowner and the contractor can sign. With this contract in place, a creative union with a common mission can begin: completing the project outlined in the contract. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The logistics of ordering materials and their delivery is one factor that the homeowner can easily control in either direction to suit their style better.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">When should the contractor order materials?</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Generally, the contractor handles most of the supply chain of materials in a home improvement project. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First, the contractor will order the materials specified for the project. Materials are typically paid out of an initial deposit made by the homeowner and by scheduled progress payments or draws. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor rarely orders all materials at the same time. In fact, it makes more sense to stagger orders according to when they will be installed in the home. This also benefits the homeowner, because materials are paid for on a rolling basis. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor or a representative takes delivery of the items and holds them either at an off-site storage location or on the building site. When it&#8217;s time to install the item, the contractor’s crew will shift the item to the building site.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the contractor is not the only person responsible for managing the selection of building materials. Except for raw building materials like drywall and two-by-four studs, other materials are the homeowner’s choice. The contractor and the homeowner will sit down together and select materials that match the homeowner’s taste and budget and satisfy the project specifications.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">When should the homeowner order materials? </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Occasionally, the homeowner and contractor arrange for the homeowner to order materials. Once the homeowner consults with the contractor, the homeowner then controls all aspects of this supply chain.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The homeowner chooses the materials, pays for them directly, accepts delivery, inspects the items, and stores them. If any items are damaged or incorrect, it is the responsibility of the homeowner to arrange for replacement or refund.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">The secret: handling logistics and specs issues</span></h3>
<p>Contractors understand why homeowners want to be on top of the managing of their own materials—it&#8217;s their dream space. H<span class="s1">owever, a mix weighted on the side of the contractor handling most logistics often works best. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Reasons why homeowners may want contractors to handle the logistics:  </span></h4>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Homeowners often focus on showpiece items such as <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frameless shower enclosures</a>, natural imported stone, and one-of-a-kind sinks or cabinets. These pieces often require special parts or unique installation packages.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Homeowners who order their own items often lose sight of the bigger picture. By focusing on particular items, they may lose sight of how the components fit within the project as a whole. Spacing is crucial, with components fitting within code-required spatial areas.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Delivery acceptance can be a hang-up for many homeowners, both due to size and quantity of materials. Large slabs of granite, countertops, assembled cabinets, doors, and bathtubs are often delivered curbside. Plans must then be made to immediately move these items to a secure location. Large-quantity items, such as the numerous boxes of flooring that arrive on pallets, are equally important. These, too, must be moved to a dry, secure area.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Delivery timing can be difficult for busy homeowners to manage. While small items might arrive on a no-signature basis, most home-related items require that a person accept delivery and sign for it. For instance, when taking delivery of countertop materials or windows, you don’t want your neighbor signing off on it. A qualified person must inspect and sign for these items. With tailgate delivery items, you typically have the opportunity to view the item before it is off-loaded. This is also not something you want your neighbor to do!<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">As a homeowner who happens to be available to take delivery of materials, should you be doing this? Most homeowners do not know how to properly check for order amounts, damage, and missing pieces. Many fixtures come with very specific pieces and parts. For some items, if a tiny screw is missing from a particular piece, installation can be help up for days or weeks while the exact piece is reported, matched, and shipped.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Pros of letting professionals handle the logistics:</span></h4>

</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How to save time and money while remodeling </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to many contractors and veteran homeowner-remodelers, the easiest way to save time and money while remodeling is to master the logistics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To do this, you must ensure that you purchase the correct items on time, in the right order. Materials purchased too early may sit in storage for too long, or might be unreturnable later on if they cannot be used. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even worse, materials bought too late slow down the project or bring it to a complete stop. When the project stops, the subcontractors go off to other projects. The contractor may direct his or her attention to other clients. Completed work, particularly exterior work, may become damaged.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">How the homeowner can be involved:</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is your home, your renovation project. You want to help manage the project, especially in the area of materials ordering and logistics (and certainly if it&#8217;ll help you to save money while remodeling!) What’s the best way to do this?  </span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Communicate with each other</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Establish a healthy flow of communication and information between you and your contractor. Phone, e-mail, video chat, and text each other on a regular basis over logistics matters; this is a best practice to follow which sets the tone for the renovation as it progresses.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Establish clear responsibilities</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Establish an agreement between the two of you as to who is responsible for which part of the logistics. </span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Aim for completion</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Conclude with a complete list of responsibilities. Be sure to spell out every aspect in writing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These options are open for you and your contractor to discuss. Take stock of how much you want to personally be involved in the logistics and what feels right to reach your dream space.</span></p>
