<p><b></b><span class="s1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_03.jpg" alt="Electric fireplace in modern living room remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52578 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Homeowners:</strong> Geoffrey, an architect, and Alicia, who works in operations at a FinTech startup, posted their modern <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/123489#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room remodel</a> on Sweeten</li>
<li><strong>Where:</strong> Manhattan on Central Park South</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> An updated living room creates custom zones with millwork and additional walls in their one-bedroom apartment</li>
<li><strong>With:</strong> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Homeowner&#8217;s quote:</strong> &#8220;Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with homeowner Geoffrey. <span class="s1">&#8220;After&#8221; photos by Kate Glicksberg.</span></i></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">An opportunity to invest in Central Park South</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the pandemic, we saw a lot of people giving up on New York, and thought it was the perfect time to double down. We drew a box around the southern half of Central Park and started searching. A lot of units had recently been taken off the market but we reached out to realtors to see if the sellers were still interested in making a move. We found our home in an ideal building and location, and made an offer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowners and their dog" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52587" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our 1,000-square-foot apartment is in an iconic mid-century building on Central Park South, which we felt offered us the best of all worlds. The Upper East and Upper West sides were easy to get to, and we love being able to spend our weekends alternating between the two.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A love of pre-war layouts</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the past, we’d always lived in pre-war buildings with architectural character and well-defined floor plans. You don’t get a lot of that in modern buildings like the mid-century one we landed in, so we created our own. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, and hired our general contractor. </span></p>
<div></div>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg" alt="dining room and modern living room remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52579 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Geoffrey-fireplace.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-53002 size-full" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wouldn&#8217;t be adding molding, chair rail, or opening up the kitchen, which are so popular these days. Instead, our plan was to define the layout in discrete ways that would <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create separate zones</a>—a proper entry foyer, a generous space for dining, and a desk niche.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our apartment’s original living room was 13 feet across and more than 30 feet long, so we had plenty of space to work with. Our goal was to create a more intimate and purposeful space that could be used for entertaining as well as a dedicated workspace for those work-from-home days.</span></p>
<h3>Creating niches in a modern living room remodel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like most New Yorkers, this was all about maximizing the available square footage. We had an opportunity to divide the extra-large living space for different purposes. By adding a small wall near the entrance to the apartment, we created a foyer on one side and an office area on the other. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the living room, the focal point was a 14-foot wall with custom-designed millwork crafted from European white oak and marble. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/carrara-vs-calacatta-marble-what-is-the-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single slab of Carrara marble</a> houses an electric <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-remodel-on-the-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace</a> and a recessed TV. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg" alt="modern living room remodel with niche office desk" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52584 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">&#8220;[M]ake sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the winter, the apartment could feel a bit dreary (our courtyard views prevent us from getting a ton of natural light). Installing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/adding-fireplace-renovation-gas-wood-burning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace would turn up the cozy-dial</a>, and we designed the entire living space around that idea. We couldn’t do a real fireplace and weren’t interested in dealing with the hassle of gels or fuel logs. We chose a beautiful electric fireplace that was the most convincing artificial unit we could find.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The white oak used throughout the renovation featured strong horizontal lines echoing the building’s iconic mid-century exterior. The material also helped brighten up the space. Bump-outs of the walls near the window created a defined dining area. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Marble slab realities</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The single biggest issue during the renovation was with the large slab of Carrara marble that would clad the front of our fireplace and media wall. It was 7 feet tall and about 5 feet wide, and we insisted that it have mitered corners. We had no idea what an ordeal it would be—the mitered corners were fragile, and a slab that size was very unwieldy. Maneuvering it through the parking garage and up the freight elevator was a half-day exercise that culminated in hours of positioning, tweaking, and polishing. We were scared the entire time that this 500-pound piece of marble would break and we’d have to start all over!</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Align your budget and your expectations</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My advice to renovators? Really <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dig into the contractors</a> you’re interviewing. Make sure that you’re 100% sure that they can do the kind of work that you want, and make sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In terms of our budget, we did pretty well and came within <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1% of the projected cost</a>. It was about $35,000 including the fireplace. Overall, we couldn’t be happier. The space is doing <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything we wanted it to</a>, and we’re excited to cozy up in front of the “fire” this winter.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<h3><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Andreas:</span> I was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Cyprus, and came back to New York for college, in my early 20s. I’ve been in the construction business professionally for 10 years.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lambros:</span> I am from the island of Cyprus and moved to the States 30 years ago. I have been involved in the construction industry for 28 years.</p>
<h3><strong>How did you get into this industry?</strong></h3>
<div>
<div>
<p data-test-id="formatted-input-0"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Andreas:</span> I obtained my Bachelor&#8217;s and Master&#8217;s degrees in Civil Engineering and worked for several design firms in New York City. Later on, I decided to follow my passion and open my own construction company.</p>
<p data-test-id="formatted-input-0"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lambros:</span> My passion started even before coming to the USA. While I was attending college, I looked for a job related to the field of architectural design. I started by working for a contractor and then decided to open a construction company.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><strong>What do you love most about what you do?</strong></h3>
<p><u>Andreas:</u> I enjoy every step of the process. I love helping people transform their place.</p>
<p><u>Lambros:</u> I love the experience with the clients and the satisfaction that comes with a finished project.</p>
<h3><strong>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New York City?</strong></h3>
<p><u>Andreas:</u> Dealing with the unexpected issues that come with the old New York City’s buildings.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47676" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Leah_WOO.jpg" alt="Women owned general contractor" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Leah_WOO.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Leah_WOO-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Leah_WOO-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>General contractor Leah has owned and operated her contracting business in NYC for almost 15 years, with experience in different points of the process. Her company completes a wide range of construction activities, from pre-development to turnover. Serving both the public and private sector, Leah has worked on projects ranging in scope and skillsets—from a condo fitness center and Victorian home restoration to a modern high-rise apartment. Each of her projects gets assigned a dedicated project manager to ensure it is completed on time and on budget.

<h3>Sweeten General Contractor Ishita | Long Island, NY</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47588 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mark_Ishita-1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="532" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mark_Ishita-1.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mark_Ishita-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mark_Ishita-1-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Ishita&#8217;s main focus is customer service. It&#8217;s a point of pride not to use &#8220;pushy sales tactics or upselling&#8221; to retain clients. Instead, she prefers to let the work speak for itself. Ishita&#8217;s general contracting firm handles all different types of renovations in Suffolk County, New York, located on Long Island. For example, she has completed single-room makeovers as well as large estate renovations. The general contractor also plans, manages, and builds multi-phase jobs. Above all, Ishita remains focused on the overall experience. &#8220;It really is about how our customers feel at the end [that matters].&#8221; <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5230#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Sweeten contractor Ishita&#8217;s reviews and work.</a></p>

<p><strong>What do you love most about construction and renovating?</strong></p>
<p>The final result—when our customers are very happy with the work we did. That’s what I love: the final product and the results.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your ideal client.</strong></p>
<p>They can communicate with you very well and express what they need. In our company, I&#8217;m the one who is in contact with customers all the time, so I make sure they are happy and we follow up with them accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>What would you like all your clients to know when you start working with them?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re as mindful of their privacy as possible and always try to be very neat and organized throughout the project.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite project?</strong></p>
<p>There are so many, we did one kitchen in Brooklyn that I am still in love with! It was in a 3-family brownstone.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;I'm originally from Albania.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;">I&#8217;m originally from Albania. </span>I have been in construction for about 10 years and opened up my own company about five years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;How did you get into construction?&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,17153,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,null,1&#093;">How did you get into construction?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;Coming here , moving out here, I guess, everybody seemed to be in construction. I moved here when I was 13 years old, my\u00a0dad worked in construction, and then a lot of people coming in to the US or coming to New York, they-- obviously, this was our entry way to construction. Then I grew up and I went to school, I graduated and part of me was still-- I felt something about construction. So what I did, after graduating, I looked at construction and I said it worked for me. It's something that I really liked, it's something-- building. I guess something about building and then\u00a0getting appreciation for something. Kind of build something and then you get to look\u00a0at it and say, \&quot;Wow.\&quot;\u00a0And then, you get that reaction from the people you're doing it for. So, that's very rewarding for me.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;">I moved to the United States when I was 13 years old. Coming here, everybody seemed to be in construction. </span>My dad worked in construction too, so I grew up with it. Building is something that I&#8217;ve always really liked. When clients look at my work and say, &#8220;Wow,&#8221; it&#8217;s very rewarding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Who is your ideal client?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;Ideal client &#091;laughter&#093;. Somebody whose not going to break my back all the time. No. My ideal client would be somebody who \u00a0 has a vision of what they want to do, and then me bringing in my experience and their vision together. And have a sort of collaboration to making something that maybe hasn't been done before, or creating\u00a0something fun and exciting.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;">I like working with somebody who has a vision of what they want to do, that I can help bring together. I like collaborating with my clients to do something fun and exciting that hasn&#8217;t been done before.</span></p>

<p><strong>Yankees or Mets?</strong></p>
<p><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;I don't even watch baseball, I'm sorry &#091;chuckles&#093;. But, hold on, I will pick Mets, because I lived in Queens for 15 years.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;">I don&#8217;t even watch baseball.

<p><strong>Favorite New York City building or structure?</strong></p>
