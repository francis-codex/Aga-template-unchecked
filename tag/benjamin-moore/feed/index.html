										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to our double issue to celebrate the long holiday weekend! Below, you will find posts that represent our greatest home renovation hits featuring some of our readers&#8217; most favorite kitchen, bathroom, and entire home renos on our blog and on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sweeten_home/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. Each homeowner came to Sweeten for help and after the project was complete took the time to share their renovation journeys with us—and you. We’re out scouting new projects next week, and will be back in full swing with the next newsletter the following week. Have a great 4th!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam and Sean’s transformation of an outdated, cookie-cutter kitchen in their Clinton Hill home got a lot of attention on our blog. Taking down a few walls opened up the space, making the room feel larger and brighter. Mix-and-match countertops create a customized look, pairing Caesarstone in Frosty Carrina with butcher block for the top of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank">peninsula</a>. Plus, graphite cabinets are a welcome departure from more neutral shades with bronze knobs for contrast. We also think our readers loved this post because Sam finished the renovation while pregnant with child number three!</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tina, who happens to be an architect, drew up a new future for her kitchen; taking down walls, expanding <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank">storage</a>, and devising a color scheme that would really pop. New cabinets were painted in Newburyport Blue by Benjamin Moore, a bold move that adds character and charm. For a striking contrast, the white subway tile backsplash and countertops—another appearance of Frosty Carrina quartz by Caesarstone—keep the space feeling bright and make it easy to understand why it was such a hit with our followers!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">SWEETEN BATHROOM: MOST READ POST ON THE BLOG</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24182 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x1084.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="1084" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/rimas-ikea-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rima’s bathroom</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rima’s renovation made her home feel like a different world altogether with a unique take on the modern bath that resonated with our readers. Needing serious updates, her bath received a new toilet, tub, sink, fixtures, vanity, tiles, and flooring. Porcelain <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank">floor tile</a> with a faux-wood finish adds warmth and character while white subway tile lends a classic look. Rima wanted the bathroom to feel modern and have plenty of storage made possible by a two-drawer vanity, plus wall and medicine cabinets.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen and Ben wanted a fresh and modern bath—like so many of our followers—so they planned on keeping it minimalist. A black hexagon floor tile with bright white grout adds a lot of visual interest while an inventive side-table-turned-vanity brings a touch of warmth and rustic charm. Plus, double medicine cabinets provide lots of sleek <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank">storage</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren’s impossibly charming studio is a marriage of modern and cozy and garnered the attention of our readers as well as </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/getting-organized-in-a-tiny-apartment.html" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Looking to create a clean, fresh, and calm feel, Lauren set out on a complete home renovation. The studio apartment especially needed help with storage since the larger closet had been converted into a small office by the previous tenant. Our favorite update: two closet makeovers that allowed Lauren to optimize her storage, making plenty of room for a serious shoe collection. Plus, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank">refinished</a> wood floors got a darker shade that changed the tone of the room, adding richness and a level of sophistication.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christine had all the floors <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank">painted</a> white in her apartment, boosting the brightness of her space and drawing the attention of our followers. The white in the bedroom is balanced by exposed brick and wood tones, amping up the coziness factor. A slim corner sink and medicine cabinet in the bathroom, plus white subway tile, transform a once dark and cramped space into a relaxing retreat. In the living room, a collection plants placed in front of another brick wall inspired by Moroccan riads—a traditional house with an interior garden—create a soothing vibe.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When they began looking for more space, Chelsea residents Lauren and Ross didn’t want to move far from their Manhattan neighborhood. Luckily, they found a new home in Kensington House, an Art Deco co-op building just three blocks from their old place. The two-bed, two-bath apartment featured plentiful space for entertaining—a must for Lauren, a food industry professional, as well as the perfect nook for Ross’ piano. The baths in this Emory Roth-designed building were true to their 1930s roots, with out-of-style tiling, industrial flushometer toilets, and exposed radiator pipes that were an unattractive hazard. The couple tapped the interior design firm White Arrow to create hotel-inspired baths with more storage. Read also about their choice for color and a unique, space-saving pocket door solution.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22106 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Pocket Door" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-723x506.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08" width="723" height="506" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-723x506.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-300x210.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-600x420.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Guest post by Chelsea homeowner and food writer Lauren Shockey</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband, Ross, and I purchased a two-bedroom apartment in Chelsea last year. We were already living in a one-bedroom apartment in the same neighborhood and wanted to upgrade to an apartment that had more space. After about three months of looking, we found the perfect apartment, only three blocks from where we were living.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the loft-style layout of the apartment we found, but the bathrooms were in a bit of a sorry state. The tile was outdated and one of the baths had a huge old-school metal tub stopper located next to the toilet. So we planned on gutting the two spaces along with a few extra upgrades, such as replacing the kitchen’s backsplash and lighting, sanding the floors, repainting the apartment, removing a desk in the study to accommodate a piano, and turning a less-than-ideal barn door in the dining foyer into a more discreet pocket door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We hired <a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Arrow</a>, a friend’s sister’s design company to assist us with the design process, and they, in turn, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our contractor</a>. Our Sweeten contractor was also very helpful throughout the design process and suggested modifications and tweaks to the original design that best fit our needs.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">Creating a wide barn pocket door proved to be a challenge but &#8220;our contractor suggested we attach three store-bought doors together&#8230;&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We initially budgeted two to three months for the renovation process, and typical for New York, ended up taking about four months. The apartment’s previous tenants took all of their light fixtures with them when they moved out, so we purchased new light fixtures for all of the rooms. I created a Pinterest board to help refine my ideas. We especially love the distinctive CB2 chandelier which hangs above our dining room table.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being a food writer and having written <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Kitchens-Behind-Burner-Hanoi/dp/B00AK2TMOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four Kitchens</a></em>, a book about working in restaurants around the world, it was important for me to have a clean, streamlined kitchen for cooking and entertaining. We loved the custom cabinets that were already in place but wanted to update the backsplash by installing white subway tiles to replace the existing small red-and-brown multicolored ones. We also swapped out the sink faucet for a contemporary Grohe fixture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ross loves playing piano, and with this apartment, we were finally able to accommodate a piano in our space. We removed a wooden plank which the previous owners had used as a desk and created a nook which was a perfect spot for an upright piano.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Creating the pocket door separating the dining area from the bedroom proved a bit of a challenge at first, but our contractor helpfully suggested that we attach three store-bought doors together, and then build a fake wall over what used to be the space for the barn door. This would be a more affordable solution than purchasing a custom wood door, which he noted would be very expensive. We then painted the door and surrounding walls Hamilton Blue by Benjamin Moore, a color we had in our old apartment, and one that we knew looked good as a backdrop for our artwork. Also in the dining area, we covered a pipe that had previously been exposed. We had initially wanted to get rid of it since it was in the middle of the walkway, but this was not possible. Our unit was originally two apartments that had been combined at some point in the past, and the pipe had been inside the dividing walls.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathrooms probably required the most work. Our designers initially suggested moving around the placement of the sink and toilet to maximize space, but this was going to require additional permits and more time. As such, we ended up leaving the tubs, sinks, and toilets in the same places, and just upgraded with new fixtures. I love taking baths so we got deep-soaking tubs for both bathrooms, as well as <a href="https://www.totousa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toto toilets</a>. For the master bath, I was inspired by the clean, elegant look of hotel bathrooms and wanted marble walls to be a focus of that space. We opted for a glass panel on the tub, which our contractor sourced for us. We also covered unattractive heating pipes with grates from <a href="https://www.archgrille.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Grille</a>. Custom shelving was added in the form of a shower niche, as well as a large in-wall cabinet opposite the sink.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the guest bath, a simple white tile with black grout was chosen to complement the Coyuchi shower curtain and an Of a Kind planter we had brought from our previous bathroom. We ran into some issues with the tiles purchased by our designers for the guest bath, so our contractor made suggestions that helped the material work in the space. Contemporary <a href="https://www.graff-designs.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graff shower fixtures</a> were selected for both showers. As for the color palette, we chose white because it was a neutral color, and it is just very soothing to have a white bathroom. Both looks are timeless, and we figured they would be appealing to us now and hopefully to anyone who bought the apartment later on.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the four months of work, we were able to move into our new space, which we now love. We tried to create a contemporary space that reflects our personal tastes while adding elements which also capture the Art Deco heritage of our apartment building.</p>
<p><em>Thanks so much, Lauren, for sharing your story! We hope your stylish new space is filled with music and good food.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An awkward space turns sanctuary with a few simple ideas</h2>
<p>When a long apartment search finally ended, Victoria’s Secret designer Christine Yao returned to one of the first listings already crossed off her list. It was the one she ultimately closed on, and she was happy with her new home—except for her bathroom which felt like showering in a dark closet. An internet search led her to Sweeten and a match with a general contractor, who would help transform the space to echo the layout and feel of the baths she&#8217;d been pinning on Pinterest for months. With smart space reconfigurations (including a vintage sliding door) and good project management, he made it happen. In her own words, Christine tells the story, from how the thought of renovating scared her to the completion of her relaxing new dwelling.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21669 size-large" title="fashion designer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-600x900.jpg" alt="White bedroom" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><em>Guest post by East Village homeowner Christine Yao</em></p>
<p>I had been living on the Lower East Side for about five years when I started looking for a place to own. My weekends became a routine, waking up and planning errands around my StreetEasy open house schedule and any listings my real estate agent sent me. The beginning was packed, usually a few on Saturday and also Sundays when I walked all over downtown and viewed up to six apartments. You quickly realize that when you are focused on staying in a specific area—for me that was roughly LES/Chinatown/East Village—there are a limited number of places to see. At first, it seemed like there were hundreds of apartments for sale, and maybe 50 you can afford. You feel like half of the 50 may not even be worth seeing from the photos but you go see them anyway. A friend who had gone through the home-buying process made a comparison to online dating—one can only tell so much from the photos, you just have to go and see it in person to really know! A few months in, I had lost out on two places, and felt a little hopeless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #a69f3d;"><em><strong>&#8220;No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?&#8221;</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, finally, six months after I started looking, I had an accepted offer and closed on a co-op in the East Village. I had actually seen this apartment at the very beginnings of my search. My brother was in town on a Sunday when I dragged him from one open house to another. We thought the apartment was in an awesome location, and was a nice size. It needed some cosmetic work, but both agreed the bathroom was terrible. It had a wall right in the middle of it with the bathtub half concealed, so it felt like you were showering in a dark closet. It was cramped, with an awkward layout, and was just in bad shape. So I crossed it off the list. The idea of a bathroom renovation was overwhelming to me, on top of buying my first home. Then six months of searching made me re-think—maybe I could. No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21673 size-large" title="bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>So now, I had a bathroom to renovate, a living space that needed a refresh, and no idea where to start. The internet brought me to Sweeten. I liked how simple and straightforward it made finding a contractor: you <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project</a> and general contractors are matched for your job. I decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>—his work was most similar to the aesthetic I was going for and he had completed a project on Sweeten with a great review.</p>
<p>My plan for the entire apartment’s look was minimalist. I love a clean space that still feels warm and cozy. Greek cave hotels and Moroccan riads are a big inspiration for me. I did have a vision of wanting the apartment to feel like a vacation&#8230;somewhere tropical and feels relaxing when you are there. The kitchen, main living area, and two bedrooms just needed a redesign. But I couldn’t imagine my day-to-day in the previous bathroom—the door opening awkwardly, the dark shower, and not being able to enjoy a bath.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21714" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02 (1)" width="600" height="900" /></p>
<p>I was hoping the middle wall obstruction could be partially removed but we wouldn’t know if it was structural until the demo. Turns out the wall had all the building plumbing running through it, so needless to say, it had to stay. However, we found serious leaks happening on the floors above and below me (I am on the third floor of a five-story building), which the building would have to fix before we could move forward. Since pipes had to be replaced, the plumbing could be re-routed, allowing us to swap tub and toilet positioning. This worked out for the best: the toilet in a “nook,” and the bathtub by the window.</p>
<p>I had so many images on my desktop saved for ideas and realized they all had the common thread of black tile floors and clean, white walls with modern fixtures. I was getting a lot of inspiration from restaurant and hotel restrooms. I definitely wanted recessed lighting above the toilet (dimmers are a must for all lighting—mood!) and exposed plumbing under the sink for more leg room.</p>
<p>I ended up ordering almost everything on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>, which has phenomenal customer service by the way. I must have looked at hundreds of sinks. We realized it had to be a corner sink or you wouldn’t have enough space to get on and off the toilet. Then the toilet had to be an appropriate size. Measured twice, measure one more time, then cross my fingers when it came in. It all fit into this Tetris game of a bathroom! I wanted a sliding door that would let light through and found an old office door at Big Reuse in Gowanus, Brooklyn. My contractor cut it down to fit the doorway and painted it.</p>

<p>The renovation was running a couple months late due to waiting on permits, so taking things like a toilet and subway tile from Home Depot that were in stock was a priority. My Sweeten contractor was so easy to work with and made things stress-free on everything from dealing with the unexpected delays and permits to coordinating a time to receive a bathtub delivery. I also trusted his aesthetic and opinion on any design or materials questions I had.</p>
<p>As far as the rest of the apartment, it’s amazing what fresh paint and swapping out things like lighting, doorknobs, and some cabinet doors can do. He did a fantastic painting job and the white floors are my favorite feature of my home. My original budget was $25,000 for renovating the bathroom and repainting the apartment. I ended up going $4,500 overbudget because I live in a co-op. The process of getting permits and running into unforeseen issues with plumbing in-between the floors increased the costs and timeline. A six-week planned renovation turned into three months. I think it was really just me underestimating the cost of labor and materials, especially living here in New York City.</p>

<p>The bathroom turned out better than I could have hoped and I am so thankful for the successful renovation I had with my contractor through Sweeten. Now that I’ve experienced the process, the advice I can offer is to be prepared for it to take longer than you think. And add another month. Be prepared to spend a good chunk of time every day on it—coordinating with your contractor, arranging delivery times, looking for fixtures, going to check on things, etc. Be ready to laugh when things go wrong. And go wrong again. It’ll be worth it when you are enjoying your renovated place, I promise.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot about the kitchen—with all of my budget going to the bathroom and painting, I just took down the cabinet doors myself and painted. That’s a move I’ve done in many apartments I’ve lived in as a renter. It’s functional for now but I can’t wait to renovate this space next!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>After spending many years patching up a rental they lived in together, two architects decided to purchase their very own fixer-upper on the top floor of an 1890s brownstone on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. One may wonder whether Kate Meagher and Arthur Liu had the same basic questions as non-design pros when it came to budget calculations, the cost of relocating plumbing, or even where to find a contractor, and the answer is yes! Having fallen in love with the view of the Hudson River, high ceilings, and the fact that the apartment hadn’t been touched since the ‘60s, they embraced the cozy new home to make &lt;500-square-foot feel significantly bigger. The couple came to Sweeten to find a team to help them reconfigure walls, add space to the kitchen, and renovate the bath. Here, Kate and Arthur tell us about their renovation journey, including a painting project that took longer than anticipated—but the results were well worth it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21477" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-723x506.jpg" alt="unnamed" width="723" height="506" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-723x506.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-300x210.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-600x420.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-21420"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by Upper West Side homeowner Kate Meagher </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Arthur and I had been living in an apartment for around seven years, which belonged to his family. That apartment—much loved—was a constant work in progress. We improved the kitchen and bathroom, installed new lighting, and suffered through two floods (thanks, upstairs neighbors!) which required new ceilings and flooring yet again. As architects, we loved it—it was great to have a rental which we could experiment on. At a certain point, however, it seemed that we should be directing our energy toward a place that was truly ours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During our search, Arthur and I had gotten into a rhythm. After each Sunday’s open house tour, we’d stop in whichever neighborhood we ended up in, get a drink, and sketch floor plans over the broker’s listing sheets. Could we fit a dishwasher? How did the closet compare with our old one? How much would it cost if the plumbing needed to be reconfigured? (Sweeten’s construction and renovation <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guides</a> were extremely helpful setting initial <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/renovation-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a> targets.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were obviously looking for a fixer-upper, and when we saw this apartment, we fell in love despite its tiny size. It’s right next to Riverside Park, on the top floor of a beautiful brownstone. The ceilings are high and the bay windows still have the original curved glass. In the winter, when the leaves are off the trees, we can see the Hudson. Best yet, outside of some electrical updates, the apartment hadn’t been touched since the 1960s. The main priorities for this apartment were to update and expand the kitchen, renovate the bathroom, and to squeeze as much storage space in without impacting the small footprint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had come across Sweeten at some point in our apartment search, and it was the first place we looked for a general contractor after we closed. Arthur and I both work on very large ground-up projects and don’t regularly work with contractors on the scale of a New York apartment renovation—we needed help finding someone! Sweeten definitely filled a niche for us, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we posted our project</a>. We interviewed several and chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>. I was struck by the notes he took throughout our initial walk-through, and that he asked for time to review further on his own. We felt he really listened and understood what we wanted and could accomplish it within our timeframe and budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21455 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Arthur_floor_plan-723x482.jpg" alt="Arthur_floor_plan" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21431 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-03" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21436 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21438 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-07" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21439" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-08" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love the classic detailing in the apartment and wanted to preserve everything we could that was more or less original. However, both our sensibilities skew contemporary/minimalist when designing, and we were looking to strike a balance. We decided to make only a few key alterations to the floorplan. First, the wall separating the kitchen/bath zone and the living room was moved, gaining us a little more than a foot-and-a-half extra. The bathroom feels more generous now, and most importantly, it allowed us to configure a narrow L-shape for the kitchen. We chose tall doors for them to align with the height of the bay windows, and drew a custom profile for the door frames—beautifully executed by our contractor’s team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The extra L-shaped length was critical to add a full-height refrigerator, full-height pantry cabinet, and an 18” dishwasher. We installed shallow 15-inch-deep cabinets in the new leg, and kept all appliances to the adjacent wall. This preserved as much floor space as possible, and had the added benefit of retaining the original locations for the plumbing, gas lines, and ducted extractor—no permits to file or added expense of rerouting. We wanted a minimal aesthetic—black and white. Ultimately, we took our cues from a soapstone countertop we saw on a Sweeten blog <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. After visiting M. Teixeira’s amazing warehouse, we chose a stone that had a lot of green undertones in the black base. For the cabinet paints, we decided on an extremely dark black-green shade, and a cool white to complement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This space ended up being a special project in the apartment. While our contractor&#8217;s team completed the major work—prepping the walls, installing wood flooring, adding lighting, installing the appliances and sink, and tiling the backsplash—Arthur and I ended up building the rest of the kitchen ourselves (!) using Ikea base cabinets that we modified and custom fronts. We also decided to just paint the fronts ourselves. (*Note: after doing it and coming out the other side, this is NOT recommended. However, if you have the time, patience and space, you will save a lot.) For those of you interested in the details: We needed to paint 26 panels—some over ten ft tall—inside the apartment because, well, that’s the only space we had. Working in stages, we brushed two coats per side, sanded, vacuumed and wiped down with a tack cloth between each coat. And our two cats meant even more obsessive vacuuming and confining them to the bedroom for most of the full month it took to paint—the threat of fur was everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21429 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-01" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21441 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-11" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21440" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-09-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedroom, our excellent foreman, Al, demolished a loft bed, and combined the small bedroom closet with an adjacent coat closet. We’ve hung a full-height curtain, so we can use every last inch of the ceiling height for storage. The entry door from the living room into the bedroom was moved toward the kitchen. Previously, it was right in the middle of a living room wall, making that room very difficult to furnish. The team expertly restored the plaster walls, and matched new wood flooring inside the closet area and kitchen with the original (our contractor really pulled through with that find!). New moldings were also seamlessly integrated in areas that had been exposed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21430 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-02" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21435 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21443 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-13" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21432" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom skews warmer in tone than the kitchen, and was designed as a spare and sleek space. We replaced the tub with a wet room—an open shower without curtains or doors—and rain shower head to keep the lines clean and open up the room. (This required an <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/business/laa.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAA permit</a>, which called for a master plumber.) A wing wall keeps all the water from splashing out, and conceals a recessed shelf for products. The contractor&#8217;s team—Al specifically—were truly master tilers. We chose a tiny copper ceramic mosaic for the floor, shower curb and base, and creamy white, elongated tile for the walls. The grout is a warm brown that picks up on the terracotta edges of the white tile and the copper tones of the floor tile. We, of course wanted every joint to match and it does. We opted for a large recessed mirrored medicine cabinet to contain clutter and a wall-mounted sink with no cabinet. Everything fits except the hairdryer, which lives in the credenza directly outside of the bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21442" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-12-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-12" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are so happy with how the project turned out. Maybe it’s the sweat equity, but it is always very satisfying to see your design realized. We couldn&#8217;t have done it without our Sweeten contractor, Al and the team. They were a pleasure to work with throughout and we’d love to collaborate again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thank you so much, Arthur and Kate, for sharing your story. It’s always intriguing to hear about a home renovation from the point of view of architects! We hope you enjoy your new home.</em></p>

<h2 class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23909 mb-0 size-chrono" title="beige-kitchen-yellow-wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-723x510.jpg" alt="beige kitchen with yellow highlight wall and white kitchen cabinets after renovation" width="723" height="510" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-723x510.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-300x212.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-600x424.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are pretty good that you’ve painted your walls before. Interior painting is a project that many are willing to tackle solo, and the prospect of a DIY job can be tempting given that the outlay is just the cost of paint and some inexpensive tools. But going pro is often the right choice, with real costs and real benefits, especially when painting is part of a more ambitious home renovation. Let’s take a look at why there are such wide variations in cost, and how to decide who is right for the job.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br /></a><b>Costs for painting by the gallon &amp; necessary equipment</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many options for paint, but tried and true staples such as <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Moore</a>, <a href="https://www.behr.com/consumer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behr</a>, <a href="https://www.askval.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valspar</a>, and <a href="https://www.sherwin-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sherwin Williams</a> are all available at your local hardware store or a big box store like Home Depot or Lowe’s. By the gallon, these brands rarely exceed $50 and usually average around $30, depending on the specifics. You can also go upscale with a luxury paint like Farrow &amp; Ball, where a gallon will run you $100, or <a href="https://www.finepaintsofeurope.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fine Paints of Europe</a>, at approximately $110 a gallon. Additionally, you’ll probably need to pay for primer, which averages around the same cost as paint. The rest of the supplies—rollers, extenders, brushes, trays/pans, and paper or tarp—will represent a small percentage of your total budget. For example, a brush costs a few dollars at any local hardware store, and a 36” x 900’ roll of brown paper costs $39 at Home Depot (enough for a very large paint job.)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Variables that&#8217;ll impact costs to paint a home&#8217;s interior </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here’s where it gets more complicated: like most other types of renovation work, painting is very site-specific. This means that all the charming idiosyncrasies of your prewar apartment (e.g., the crown moldings, prized paneling, that curved hallway wall) translate into higher painting costs. Many experts will refuse to provide a bid without a site visit, and with good reason. They need to make a visual assessment of the condition of the walls and surroundings before providing a competitive estimate. They will want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What condition are the walls in and how much prep will be required?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How high are the ceilings, what are the specific dimensions of the surfaces, and how much trim detail is there?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the quality of work in the rest of the apartment? (This helps them assess where to land on the spectrum of “rental grade” to “luxury” in terms of the finished product.)</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there furniture to work around? How much of it?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there lead present in the existing paint?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the building restrictions on construction work?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where is the site?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23910 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-highlight-wall-breakfast-nook" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-723x1083.jpg" alt="blue highlight wall in a breakfast nook with dining table and hanging pendant lights after renovation " width="723" height="1083" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-723x1083.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Painters use all of this information to assess how many labor hours the job will require. For example, they take into account how much commuting time will be required, and how long a day they will be allowed to work. They think about whether they’ll have to circle the block and monitor a meter, or if they can just park in your driveway. And, they note how much prep will be necessary, in addition to the actual painting time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One other variable to keep in mind is that small projects tend to offer less bang for your buck because there is some time that elapses between steps. For example, if your project is limited to one bedroom, there isn’t anything else the workers can do while they are waiting for the primer to dry, whereas if your project includes more rooms, they can alternate working in different spaces. For a small project, you end up paying for the whole day anyway, because waiting becomes part of the job.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Labor costs for painting </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, painters are often willing to provide their per-hour rate to clients, unlike general contractors or millworkers, whose projects are not as easily broken down into an hourly rate. This means that once you know the per-hour rate that your painter charges, and how many hours the job will take, there is very little mystery to how your project will be billed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While hourly labor rates do vary, they typically start at about $25 to $30 per hour on the low end and average around $50 to $60 per hour for an experienced painter (not a huge range.)</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Preparation before interior painting walls</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The real disparity in painting costs arise because of the amount of time spent on prep. Prep work is what makes the difference between a rental-grade finished product and a high-end, luxury one. Perfectly smooth walls and incisive clean lines are difficult (and thus expensive) to come by, so it is often just a question of how much imperfection a homeowner is willing to live with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If one painter provides a $5,000 bid for a project while another painter bids $3,000, most of the difference will be in the amount of prep. The higher bid will probably involve carefully “raking” the walls (a process that involves darkening the room and using a small spotlight to highlight problem spots), systematically repairing all the spots, applying and sanding down compound, and then a thorough cleaning of all the surfaces to ensure maximum paint adhesion. The lower bid will likely skip over some of these steps to reduce labor hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unsurprisingly, detail work takes a lot of prep. Taping and prep steps double as soon as you introduce a line of molding in a contrasting color, and trim details are critical focal points so your design choices and architectural details will come into play in determining project timeline and cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many renovators have also wondered about skim-coating, a particularly time-intensive (and thus costly) aspect of prep work. Skim-coating is a process in which you smooth out the wall by rolling thinned-out, all-purpose joint compound (“mud”) on the walls, and then immediately smooth it out with a knife edge. Because the mud dries quickly, it can only be applied in small patches. And each layer is thin, so it may require multiple layers to even out very bumpy or textured walls. Although it sounds relatively simple, it requires skill and experience to do well. As a result, skim-coating is billed separately, and at a higher rate (roughly $10 to $20 more expensive than painting by the hour), and will also take more time than the painting itself. That combination of a higher hourly rate and more time needed for skim-coating can easily double the cost of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Skim-coating is a big undertaking. If you’re on the fence about whether your walls need it, you might compromise by focusing on areas that are well lit (where defects are easy to see) or in rooms that you plan to paint with a gloss or semi-gloss paint (these finishes tend to magnify imperfections). You might decide that a very visible wall that gets lots of natural light needs the full treatment, while walls that aren’t quite as prominent or immediately visible upon entry get a bit less focus. Pause in each room and think about where your eye hits when you walk in and out and when you are naturally using the room. You may find that only one out of four walls really needs the re-surfacing that skim-coating provides.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And lastly, if there is lead paint detected in your home, there are additional steps that workers must take to contain dust. Painters will need to ensure special staging of the work site with plastic tarp, and use special vacuums that do not recirculate dust into the air. Again, more time spent prepping equals more money.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review surfaces and walls before beginning to paint </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a homeowner, you can start by assessing the condition and complexity of the space, and think through how much prep and perfection you want to include in your budget. An empty room with walls in decent condition might just need one to two painters over one to two days of work to get a fresh coat up, whereas an entire home with varied surfaces and heavy furniture will require a full team working over the course of two weeks or more to prep, paint, and finish across a variety of spaces.</p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">Hardware or big box stores like Home Depot or Lowe’s will usually charge $30-50/gallon. Upscale paint brands can cost $100/gallon or more. Calling in experts? Painting labor starts at $25-30/hour, with an average of $50-60/hour for experienced painting contractors. The amount of prep the walls will need before being painted will also factor heavily into final costs.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/scandi-brooklyn-sweetened-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14499 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marioapt.jpg" alt="clinton hill coops" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marioapt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marioapt-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario, who works in media, and Joe, who works in healthcare, bought their one-bedroom co-op in 2013 and spent a year learning their way around its many nooks and crannies. The original space had lots of doors and walls that kept the kitchen and pantry closed off from the living and dining rooms, blocking windows and hiding just how much square footage was actually in play. Mario geared up for a full renovation that would bring walls down and open the space up, and Joe plotted the demise of the apartment’s dark parquet floors. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten general contractor</a> to execute on their vision.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting in the kitchen, their contractor demo&#8217;ed walls to let light in from this apartment’s signature corner windows. They couldn’t move a structural column so it became the visual marker for the new kitchen’s expanded lines. Maybe surprisingly, they brought down the kitchen ceiling a few inches to make room for recessed lighting and to demarcate the newly open spaces – raising the ceiling seems to be the goal in many renovations, but you can see where a few inches of lost height made complete sense here. Mario and Joe chose <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/kitchen-cabinets-fronts-24254/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA’s now-classic white lacquer cabinetry</a> and sourced contemporary cabinet pulls from <a href="https://cabinetparts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinetparts.com</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Their contractor helped design the new kitchen island to allow access from both sides. The island is unusually large and far from the kitchen wall, but with drawers on both sides (plus a <a href="https://www.goedekers.com/Summit-CL24WC2.html?utm_source=Amazon&amp;utm_medium=cse&amp;utm_campaign=CL24WC2&amp;zmam=34103103&amp;zmas=2&amp;zmac=231&amp;zmap=Summit-CL24WC2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Summit wine fridge</a>), it manages to be kitchen-focused on one end with a great work-space option on the other. Mario and Joe decided to keep all of the appliances in a row along the kitchen’s back wall with an all-star line-up that includes a <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com/cgi-bin/ajmadison/MAS304GASXE.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bertazzoni range</a>, a stainless steel <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/productslist/home-appliances/SHX65T55UC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch dishwasher</a>, and a slim <a href="https://www.us-appliance.com/rf135bdlux1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel fridge</a> with bottom freezer. The backsplash was an admitted splurge – Mario and Joe fell for an <a href="https://www.annsacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ann Sacks tile</a> with an architectural feel and a subtle matte finish. From the living room it disappears, but in the kitchen, the raised detail is super gorgeous.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the apartment, Mario and Joe replaced dark parquet tiles with wide-plank, 7 1/2“ matte-finished oak floors. They chose the starkest white wall color they could find to keep the main space modern (they actually chose <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/redirects/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=linenwhite&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Moore’s Linen White</a>, which has a very white feel in their place despite a name that suggests creamy undertones). The contractor updated baseboard molding with square trim, added low-rise built-in <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/living-room-storage-system-29882/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA cabinets</a> as a media center in the living room, stacked floating shelves in the master bedroom, and brought in extra help to overhaul the apartment’s big closets.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario and Joe’s style sensibility works so well in the new layout. Somehow, they appear to have already owned most of the art and furniture pieces that look tailor-made in here. Mario explained that the trick was in figuring out where to place furniture and art after walls came down and left fewer surfaces for hanging pieces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A decor round-up is in order: the kitchen counter stools, couch, and coffee table are all from <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West Elm</a>, the dining table is from <a href="https://www.cb2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CB2</a>, and the geometric red rug is a <a href="https://www.crateandbarrel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crate &amp; Barrel</a> pick. Sadly, the cowhide rug was a wanderlust find in Chile and the retro print hanging above the bed is from a DC market, so you can’t have either, but there is a lot here that anyone could work with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And in case you missed it, the couple also gutted their bathroom.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, we ventured just a ways up the street from Sweeten&#8217;s NYC headquarters to the East Village for a tour of a gut-renovated one bed, one bath co-op. This place was &#8212; to use the technical term &#8212; a disaster. As the apartment&#8217;s new owner, Henry, was clear to note in his <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten project post</a>, the kitchen was destroyed, the bathroom was destroyed, the living room was destroyed&#8230;the whole place needed modern re-design and upgrades that would improve flow and use of space. Henry couldn&#8217;t move in until work was done, so we introduced him to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a> to manage some serious demolition and rebuilding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-henrys-east-village-condo-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14126 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_HenryApt-cover.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_HenryApt-cover" width="600" height="410" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_HenryApt-cover.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_HenryApt-cover-300x205.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span id="more-14111"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Henry works for an investment bank in New York City and took an appraising look at the kitchen, bathroom, living room, and bedroom of his new purchase. It wasn&#8217;t just that the unit had considerable damage in each room, Henry also saw the potential for better use of space and ways to connect the rooms to one another. He planned to remove a dividing wall between the kitchen and living room and re-orient the kitchen so that it would open toward the rest of the apartment and let more light in. Henry also found himself puzzled by decisions the previous owner made in the bathroom. Half of the bath had been lined with faux wood paneling and the other half was inexplicably blocked off by the tub&#8217;s entire length. The East Village certainly has plenty of old tenement-building bathrooms, but this was on another level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14127" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/unnamed.png" alt="unnamed" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/unnamed.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/unnamed-225x300.png 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s team played a big role in suggesting solutions, finalizing layout plans, and selecting materials for this full overhaul. The kitchen wall came down to reveal a generous open living area, and the team installed brand new pre-finished 5&#8243; wide plank wood flooring (from <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Solid-Hardwood/Plank/N-5yc1vZbejwZ1z0wtnu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>) to unite the entire apartment. Henry went with his experts&#8217; consensus that white shaker cabinetry would modernize and brighten the kitchen, and added a masculine, contemporary touch with a mixed material backsplash that incorporates dark and light steel and glass elements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor found the neutral quartz countertop and floated a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bosch-HGI8054UC-Stainless-Sealed-Burner/dp/B00NN14VBM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455053334&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bosch+range&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=sweeten09-20&amp;linkId=27f3fb1ed17872f3098001b5afd5329a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">five burner Bosch gas stove</a> in the center of the new kitchen peninsula. Henry wanted a hood that wouldn&#8217;t stand in the way of the new open plan &#8211; extensive online research led him to a heavy-duty but slim and round <a href="https://www.siriuscappe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sirius stainless steel hood</a>. Henry continued the high-end appliance theme with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bosch-SHX68T55UC-Integrated-Dishwasher-Stainless/dp/B0057WCGJ4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=41enmLfZCwL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR160,160_&amp;refRID=0CMVKF4X7X7N90M5N1B0&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=sweeten09-20&amp;linkId=b5b5d74ab2b214570e37bf6e7fb904b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch dishwasher</a> and <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/products/refrigerators" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fridge</a> and added a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O4CUB7M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=kraus%20faucet&amp;qid=1455053581&amp;ref_=sr_1_cc_5&amp;s=aps&amp;sr=1-5-catcorr&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=sweeten09-20&amp;linkId=6b35773091e6690520784865d96ba35f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kraus single-lever faucet</a> to the sink. Henry joined the impressive ranks of New Yorkers Who Have Laundry IN Their Homes by stowing an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-WM1377HW-White-Stackable-Washer/dp/B00QMPNOZK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455053706&amp;sr=1-26&amp;keywords=lg+front+load+washer&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=sweeten09-20&amp;linkId=7dcc1477b5619f51503bd09fc7f9d61a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG front-load washer and dryer</a> pair in what would otherwise be an inaccessible kitchen corner.

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the team ripped out the old tub and put in Italian ceramic floor tiles that mimic a light wood grain finish. Henry decided on a simple and modern half wall and full shower tile and created a beautiful accent wall with rippled gray tile that suggests flowing water. The shower floor is now anchored with a blue-gray small cube tile. The team added a frameless glass shower door with chrome finishes and installed a modern, wall-mounted sink vanity that Henry likes for its clean lines and hotel spa look.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Henry&#8217;s expert team did a lot of cosmetic work to return the living areas and bedroom to full working order. Henry chose a <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/color-overview/color-collections" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neutral Benjamin Moore gray</a> and loves the tall, streamlined baseboard molding that the contractor suggested using. New closet doors with 93&#8243; height doors were added to the bedroom and the apartment&#8217;s east-facing windows are now stylishly dressed in warm wood blinds, another standard <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Decor-Blinds-Window-Treatments/N-5yc1vZar4w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a> find.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/bathrooms/elinor-and-joels-park-slope-bathroom-renovation-homeowner-guest-post"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13912" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed.png" alt="unnamed" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Guest post by Elinor in Park Slope</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-13906"></span>We bought our Park Slope co-op six years ago knowing that the bathroom would have to be renovated but hoping that we wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about it for several years. The delay was partly about recovering from the process of buying our first place &#8211; which was pretty stressful &#8211; but it probably had more to do with being complete novices when it came to finding, hiring, and working with a contractor. We worried about making mistakes that could both cost us a bundle and do a lot of damage to our home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a 1920s building with a lot of original features, the bathroom still had a beautiful original tub and all of it&#8217;s pre-war tile. The plumbing, however, was also a 1920s original and some bad patches made over the years to the tile and fixtures were starting to fall apart. The medicine cabinet was rusty and so thickly painted that the door no longer closed. Towel rails fell off the wall. The shower started sending more water out of the tap than the shower head. And finally, the old regulator flush toilet sprung a leak that threatened a serious flood. Action was needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13915" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/before-1.jpg" alt="before-1" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/before-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/before-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;d read about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> in an article in the New York Times and, almost on a whim, posted our project. I was surprised by how quickly they got in touch. We were introduced to Sweeten Expert Niki who had also been mentioned in the Times article and whose name I had run across doing independent research. Working with Sweeten gave us that extra confidence to move ahead knowing we had a team that had been screened, but we also liked being able to call up Sweeten to ask questions about practical things like what to expect from the estimate process and how payment schedules are generally set up. Niki&#8217;s team was a great fit because they brought design and build expertise &#8211; we just didn&#8217;t have the time (or patience) to run all over town looking at tile samples and taps and we needed someone to help narrow down all the choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My ideal was to somehow bring the bathroom back to its shiny, original look by restoring the tile rather than starting from scratch and replacing it all. But it quickly became clear that to sort out the plumbing and move the shower head, the wall tile would have to come down and objectively, it really was too far gone to save. With that decision made, we chose materials that were as close to the originals as possible, which meant polished chrome fixtures from <a href="https://www.barclayproducts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barclay</a> (the tub filler and hand-shower), and a thermostatic control, shower head, and sink tap all from <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler</a>. We found a shiny metal medicine cabinet from <a href="https://rh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Restoration Hardware</a> and continued the original tile surround with classic subway tile in a soft cream finish (&#8220;bone gloss&#8221;) rather than the more modern pure white. We couldn&#8217;t quite replicate the original black and white frieze near the top, so we chose a plain black tile as a contrast trim instead &#8212; all from <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nemo Tile</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13919" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01" width="600" height="406" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13926 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-07.jpg" alt="benjamin moore teal" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-07-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original tub stayed and was reglazed; Niki and team also managed to save the original black and white floor tile. They built a new vanity with a Carrera marble top and glass pulls found on <a href="https://www.rejuvenation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rejuvenation</a>, which provides a lot of storage in a small space. They also added a modern light switch and gfi outlet so that I could finally use a hairdryer without crouching by an outlet in the bedroom. Accessories from <a href="https://www.potterybarn.com/shop/bath/?cm_type=gnav" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pottery Barn</a>, including the towel rail, glass shelf, and wall-mount light fixture fit right in with our mix of old and new. The new <a href="https://www.totousa.com/products/toilets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toto toilet</a> is light years beyond the its predecessor&#8230;no explosions or leak floods in our future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bit that no amount of research can prepare you for is how frazzled you will become: no matter how hard you try, your sense of humor will fail and you will be THAT client at some point in the process. And working with even the nicest of co-op boards will take a minimum of three months when plumbing is involved. It&#8217;s just hard to be realistic about those things up front. Niki managed the setbacks gracefully and the team worked really well with our building`s team, which is a huge help in keeping relationships friendly with your super and the neighbors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that it&#8217;s done, we love our new space and every morning I can enjoy taking a shower in the new thermostatically-controlled rainwater shower. The paint color (<a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Moore&#8217;s &#8220;Nearly Teal&#8221;</a>) never fails to cheer me up. It really is a shinier, happier version of its original self, minus the exploding toilet&#8230;!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna moved into their two-bedroom home &#8212; a former kindergarten classroom in a converted South Slope / Greenwood Heights Catholic school &#8212; four years ago. High ceilings, check. Big windows, check. Modern urban oasis, check. Erica, who works for the City of New York, and Donna, a digital product consultant, were initially drawn to industrial and rustic decor as a way to balance and warm up the contemporary feel of their new space. But, after overspending on a pricey couch and accenting the windows and doors with a red paint that grew to irritate them both, the couple decided they needed design help. After they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a>, we introduced them to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/814" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten designer</a> to help bring new life to this old-school space.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="small-bedroom-with-hardwood-before-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47989 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3.jpg" alt="small bedroom with hardwood floor before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="bedroom-with-teal-accent-wall" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47984 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2.jpg" alt="small bedroom with teal accent wall and wall lights and hardwood floors and windows after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Our designer had a lot of creative ideas. Some of the areas of our apartment that she transformed were not even on our radar design-wise until she pointed them out.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Erica W., Brooklyn Homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna focused first on their bedroom. They wanted tranquility, comfort, and a little romance; they also needed to maximize the long, narrow layout of the room and find art to make the space feel personal and vibrant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The designer sought to create a relaxed retreat, in tune with the couple&#8217;s design preferences. She put together an inspiration booklet to illustrate creative concepts, drawings, and to simply nail the creative vision. The trio took group shopping trips and worked together to upgrade the shabby-schoolhouse-chic vibe with cleaner lines, bolder colors, and improved. Their designer led the way with an accent wall in Benjamin Moore Venezuelan Sea, offset by the existing gray on the remaining walls. Two smart tricks here: first, the accent wall appears to wash onto the overdyed rug, lengthening <wbr />the space in a way that makes the furniture selections look custom and built-in, and second, the accent wall provides an immediate visual shift, just by painting a single wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="bedroom-with-teal-accent-wall" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47983 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1.jpg" alt="bedroom with teal accent wall and adjustable long reach wall mounted lights after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna love the gray tufted Cisco Brothers bed &#8211; it anchors the room and offers geometric depth to the monochromatic bedding (full disclosure: I am <a href="https://sweeten.com/team/apartment-renovation-east-village/">partial to gray tufted upholstery</a>!). The designer found a gorgeous and super-functional armed lighting fixture on <a href="https://classifieds.apartmenttherapy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apartment Therapy Classifieds</a> to feature above the bed &#8211; a hat tip to Erica and Donna&#8217;s fondness for industrial pieces but with a decidedly glam finish. Mounting the lighting fixture on the wall above the bed freed up space on each bedside table, crucial in a room with just eight feet in width to spare. If you look closely, you can catch a side glimpse of Marilyn Monroe swimming in the photo on the left wall. Erica especially loves this piece and the shot of red and green it offers up to complement other accents in the room.</p>
<h2>&#8220;I sought to create a refreshingly relaxed retreat. The solution was to carry varying hues of blue and green heavily-pigmented accent walls &#8211; the colors of the sea &#8211; throughout the space. Serene, but invigorating.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>&#8211; </em>Sweeten Designer</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the open living room, their designer set out to rehab the &#8220;expensive mistakes&#8221; that frustrated Erica and Donna. They focused on highly saturated paint colors and new, more comfortable furniture. The windows are such a central feature to the space; the designer restored their presence with Benjamin Moore Super White throughout the room and cleared away stuff that had accumulated on the unusually deep window sills. They also selected a central wall to saturate with yellow, anchoring the space. To further play up the industrial loft theme, a structural beam and elements of the sprinkler system were coated in a dark bronze.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="dining-with-black-framed-windows" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47985 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-3.jpg" alt="open dining area with hardwood floors and windows with black frames after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna swapped out their dining set for Eames molded chairs. The dining table, already part of their collection, reflects the couple&#8217;s love for reclaimed materials, but looks updated with the clean lines of the new chairs. The Milo Baughman coffee table is simple and uncluttered; the Saarinen side table plays up the clean and modern furniture touches &#8211; both were savvy finds on eBay.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="living-room-with-fan-accent-wall" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47986 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-4.jpg" alt="living area with hardwood floors and fan and accent yellow wall after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Toward the kitchen, visitors get their first glimpse of an accent wall coated in Benjamin Moore Juniper. As a standalone feature, it&#8217;s a fun addition to the yellow and white throughout the room. But, it also serves as a sneak peak into the new bedroom and ties the spaces together visually. Erica and Donna revived the old kitchen cabinets, originally finished with a faux cherry wood stain, by painting them with Farrow &amp; Ball&#8217;s Light Blue. I love this color &#8211; it is equal parts vintage and modern, simple but playful.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Behind the kitchen, Erica and Donna invested in creating a new closet space to help them keep stuff organized and out of sight. Working from the design, this Sweeten contractor built shelving and enclosed the closet with sliding doors and simple hardware.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="hallway-with-closets-hardwood-floors" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47990 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-5.jpg" alt="hallway with hardwood floors and closets and white walls after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The project needed a high level of skill and creative thinking to accomplish what looks quite simple. We created a truly wonderful interior environment with high-end finishes that the client completely loves.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">-Bob Reid, tS member &amp; owner of ReidBuild</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This week we&#8217;re on Madison Ave. with new tS member <a href="https://sweeten.com/2301" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReidBuild</a>, for a close up look at their <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-end, Brazilian-inspired condo renovation</a>. Despite this apartment&#8217;s beautiful Central Park views, the space had its share of challenges to address in the renovation &#8212;  in general, the apartment lacked any charm or style, and, after being originally built in the 80&#8217;s, no updates had been made to it since. When it came to constructing the new design, the old framing system did not allow for the new electrical and plumbing lines, so the ReidBuild team took all the walls out and built them back new. After 14 months of construction, the 3-bed, 3-bath apartment embraced its sophisticated new style.<span id="more-9607"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9612 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg" alt="high-end-renovation-reidbuild" width="600" height="661" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation-272x300.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new home is light and open, with a beachy palette of bright whites and sea greens. The Brazilian-inspired design and style comes from the client and architect, both are from San Paulo, Brazil. Here in the dining room, the city skyline is on full display through large windows and reflected in an oversized, 12&#8242; x 7.5&#8242;  chrome-frame, mirrored glass barn door on industrial hardware, by <a href="https://www.bartelsdoors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bartels</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9613" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg" alt="03_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison Ave Renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The adjacent living room features custom white satin lacquer millwork for the entertainment unit, AC covers, bookcase and baseboards, as well as an integrated sound system. The living room, dinning room, kitchen and hallway are all painted with <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/redirects/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=oc-117&#038;">Benjamin Moore&#8217;s Simply White</a>, to create a beautiful contrast with the custom, hand scraped black oak floors by <a href="https://www.lvwood.com/">LV Wood</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9615 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg" alt="high-end-renovation-reidbuild" width="600" height="901" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation-599x900.jpg 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love the kitchen&#8217;s simple and very graceful style. Here, ReidBuild carefully installed new custom-built, white cabinets by Brazilian company Florense, as well as very fragile, white back painted, glass countertops by <a href="https://zeccaglass.com/">Zecca Glass</a>. Other modern touches include a gas stovetop from <a href="https://www.mieleusa.com/domestic/cooking-classes-3721.htm">Miele&#8217;s Hexa Design Series</a> and <a href="https://www.dornbracht.com/us/en-US/Products.aspx?view=list&#038;Series=Tara+Classic&#038;preferredItem=D883667EDB5D4CEA87F94330EC911FF3">Dornbracht&#8217;s Tara Classic Faucet</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The new master bedroom gets lots of natural light during the day, making the Luton electric blackout shades (used throughout the apartment) a necessary accessory. The bedroom&#8217;s muted tones and soft touches &#8212; fabric wall treatments, satin finish cabinets, and beautiful wool carpeting by Einstein Moomly &#8212; make it the perfect place to relax and recharge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9617 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/07_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg" alt="high-end-renovation-reidbuild" width="600" height="921" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/07_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/07_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation-195x300.jpg 195w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/07_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation-586x900.jpg 586w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
Each of the home&#8217;s 3 bathrooms feature Thasos slab marble surfaces by <a href="https://www.davincistoneinc.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DaVinci Stone</a>, and classically-designed fixtures. The faucet above is <a href="https://uk.lefroybrooks.com/products/lb-1220/">Lefroy Brooks classic three hole basin mixer</a> with a <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Vintage-under-mount-bathroom-sink/productDetail/Under-mount-Sinks/417525.htm?brandId=651412&amp;skuId=357750&amp;categoryId=651399&amp;page=catProductDetails&amp;hash=id%3Dfilters%26startIndex%3D20%26scrollTop%3D0">Kohler Vintage under-mount sink</a>. The glass shower enclosure, white glass counter and wall are by Zecca Glass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9618 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/09a_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg" alt="high-end-renovation-reidbuild" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/09a_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/09a_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
In the new guest room, walls are painted custom color which reminds us of a day at the beach. It also features custom built-in wall niches with mirrored backs, which add to the lightness of the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9611 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg" alt="high-end-renovation-reidbuild" width="600" height="411" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;s Bob Reid, owner of ReidBuild, back at work in his office &#8212; we can&#8217;t wait to see more beautiful projects from Bob and his team!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you ReidBuild, and special thanks to photographer Ricky Zehavi for sharing her photos with us!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In March, West Village homeowner Franz posted to theSweeten in need of a contractor to create a built-in shelving unit for his studio apartment. We connected Franz with tS member Gennadiy Kaliberda, owner of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">South Fork Projects</a>, who was able to do the job quickly &amp; cost-effectively &#8212; and just in time for the homeowner to leave for an extended stay abroad. While away, Franz is subletting the home to his friend Matt, who invited us to see how the project turned out. We love the new built-ins, which have made it easy for both the permanent &amp; temporary tenants to keep their belongings in the same, small space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ever since our <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/site-visit-brooklyn-brownstone-gut-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">construction visits</a> at the end of last year, we&#8217;ve been anticipating our return to Ditmas Park to see this completed first floor gut renovation, built by a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368">Sweeten member</a>. The 1000 sqft, Brownstone home had not been updated in 40 years before AMC was brought in to transform the heavily compartmentalized living spaces of the first floor into an open, functional, and modern family home. The team at AMC had their work cut out for them, beginning with asbestos abatement and structural reinforcing which was necessary to create the new, open plan. They also relocated plumbing, updated electrical, and integrated a new HVAC system before moving onto the modern finishes we see now.</p>

The homeowners worked with architect &amp; new tS member, Slavica Novak Nikolic R.A. of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Urban Bond Creative,</a> to create a layout that works much better with their lifestyle; the open plan is ideal for entertaining and for keeping the family connected, even when working on separate things.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="photo-during-renovation"  class="wp-image-38666 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/03_-560x420.jpg" alt="demolished rooms during renovation" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/03_.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/03_-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Here&#8217;s a view from the former kitchen on our first visit during demolition. Once the non-load-bearing walls had been removed, we could already start to picture an open, modern home!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="dining-open-to-kitchen"  class="wp-image-38667 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3057-560x840.jpg" alt="dining room with chandelier and open to kitchen and living room and hardwood floors after renovation " width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3057.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3057-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />And here&#8217;s that same view now! In huge contrast to the cramped feeling of before, the first floor is now almost completely open. We love how the kitchen ceiling really seems to float overhead without any apparent vertical structure. Variations in ceiling height &#8212; where soffits have been used to conceal mechanical systems &#8212; also help to accentuate this lightness.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="built-in-butler-pantry-in-dining-room"  class="wp-image-38668 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3010-560x884.jpg" alt="dining room with chandelier and built in butler pantry and hardwood floors after renovation" width="560" height="884" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3010.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3010-190x300.jpg 190w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> The new dining area features a clever built-in buffet using ikea cabinetry &#8212; ikea&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ramsjo</a> system lets you alternate solid &amp; glass face panels, which works surprisingly well here to create the feeling of a custom unit. White walls here and throughout the space are painted in Benjamin Moore&#8217;s <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">china white</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="butcher-block-island-countertop"  class="wp-image-38669 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3044-560x373.jpg" alt="island with butcher block countertop and pendant lights and white kitchen cabinets after renovation" width="560" height="373" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3044.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3044-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The buffet&#8217;s solid-panel ramsjo cabinets continue into the kitchen, along with <a href="https://www.caesarstoneus.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caesarstone</a> countertops in &#8216;pure white.&#8217; A wood top for the island adds a bit of warmth to the space &#8212; and interestingly, this red wood, called African Padauk, will transition over time to a darker, purple/brown color due to light exposure. Niches built into the wall for display are another subtle but unique detail, adding even more originality to the space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="open-living-space-with-hardwood-floors"  class="wp-image-38670 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3060-560x809.jpg" alt="open living with tray ceilings and recessed and wall mounted lighting after renovation" width="560" height="809" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3060.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3060-208x300.jpg 208w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Next to the kitchen, this bathroom came as a pleasant surprise &#8212; it&#8217;s so fresh, with its modern fixtures, hardwood floors, and big pops of color &amp; pattern. Bright red paint was custom matched to this awesome <a href="https://www.flavorpaper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooklyn-themed toilet wallpaper</a>, designed by Beastie Boy Mike D &amp; Revolver NY, and printed &amp; sold by our friends at <a href="https://www.flavorpaper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flavorpaper</a> in Brooklyn.</p>

Underfoot, new white oak flooring runs throughout the whole first floor.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="living-room-with-tray-ceiling"  class="wp-image-38671 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2940-560x840.jpg" alt="living room with tray ceiling and recessed lighting and hardwood floors after renovation" width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2940.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2940-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />Looking back through the living space from the office &#8212; it&#8217;s so difficult now to imagine this space chopped into so many separate rooms!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="living-room-with-tray-ceiling"  class="wp-image-38672 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2960-560x840.jpg" alt="living room with tray ceiling and recessed lighting and hardwood floors after renovation" width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2960.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2960-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> For these happy homeowners, we&#8217;re sure it feels great to relax in their much improved home!</p>
<p>Many thanks to Alan Bowes &amp; his team at AMC, Slavica Nikolic, and to homeowners Sarah &amp; Mike.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we were invited to tour the beautiful new Prospect Heights eatery, <a href="https://elbertarestaurant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elberta</a>, designed by Anishka and Niya of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ishka Designs</a>. We were excited to learn more about another great business in Brooklyn after our recent small biz story slam night. We&#8217;re also thrilled to see an increasing number of small business owners posting their projects on our main site&#8230;a <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/Bring-the-Vibe-restaurant-West-Village-New-York-NY-looking-for-estimates/601#details">restaurant</a>, an office and a shuffleboard court! For this project, the designers worked alongside the business owners to give a sophisticated makeover to the former Velvet Peach Cafe. Now the space, the mood, and the menu are all distinctly a part of the conceptual character of Elberta.</p>

The designers sourced the fixtures on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/SouthernLightsTN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">etsy</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_4155" style="width: 570px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4155" class="size-full wp-image-4155 mb-24" title="Elbert Restaurant - Ishka Designs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-4155" class="wp-caption-text">Near the back of the space, gold &amp; white wallpaper in a floral motif adds a touch of femininity. From this view we can get a sense of how the designers worked in layers of texture &amp; contrasting colors to create Elberta&#8217;s mood. The brick wall was painted to match the white of the wallpaper using Mountain Peak White from the Natura line by Benjamin Moore.</p></div>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-4156 mb-24" title="Elbert Restaurant - Ishka Designs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>One of the most important features and the inevitable centerpiece of the bar/restaurant was the bar top itself. The designers selected a sustainable surface by <a href="https://torzosurfaces.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TorZo</a>, made from sorghum stalks. And for the bar face, glass panels were mounted over a white surface.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each week we visit a member of Sweeten network to check out what they are working on. This week we thought we&#8217;d try something new and share a bit about a homeowner.<a href="https://dbryantarchie.com/"><br />
</a><a href="https://dbryantarchie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D. Bryant Archie</a> is a textile designer and Brooklyn homeowner member of Sweeten community. D&#8217;s apartment, located in Prospect Lefferts Gardens, is painted with rich deep color tones while her bathroom was a basic Decorator&#8217;s White. So she hired one of our members to paint the bathroom with vertical strips in Benjamin Moore China White and Onyx. Now her bathroom works to complete &amp; compliment the overall look and feel of the apartment.</p>
