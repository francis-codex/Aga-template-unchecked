<p><b>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</b></p>
<p>We&#8217;re both from Poland and have been in construction for about 10 years.</p>
<p><b>How did you get into construction? </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paulina</span>: I had to be like 11 years old when my dad hired an architect to design a little fireplace outside of our house. I thought she was so cool because she came out with a lot of drawings and blueprints. I thought, &#8220;Wow, this is really, really amazing.&#8221; Ever since I met that architect, I was inspired to design. Later, when I worked for a construction company, I decided I actually wanted to design and build.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;\nP: My dad, for me, I think. The first time, oh my God, I had to be like 11. He hired an architect to design a little fireplace outside of our house and I thought she was so cool because she came out with a lot of the drawings and blueprints and stuff. And I was like, \&quot;Wow, this is really, really amazing.\&quot; So, for me, it was seeing her being an architect and designing. I wanted to design and then when I worked for a construction company, I decided I actually wanted to also do design and build.\nA: Actually, construction was like my passion. When I was 19 years old, I just started to do something small in the house. I loved this from the beginning and that's like my hobby now and I work this really, so I like my job.\nP: You did a lot of wood working.\nA: Yes.\nP: Built like stuff when he was younger.\nA: Yeah, and younger. 15 years old, I--\nP: He worked as a carpenter since he was 16 years old?\nA: Yeah.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Albert</span>: Construction has always been my passion. I did a lot of woodworking when I was very young and worked as a carpenter when I was 16. I loved it from the beginning. What used to be a hobby became something I did professionally. I love my job.</span></p>
<p><strong>What do you love most about construction?</strong></p>
<p>Different projects and the clients—you pick a project, go from start to finish, and then start again with a different project. There&#8217;s a uniqueness to the changing environment.</p>
<p><b>What is your ideal client?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Someone who has a general sense of what they’re looking for, but maybe didn&#8217;t have a chance to get the advice they needed. I like when we find somebody that we can actually help. They&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Okay! Nobody actually explained it to me like that!&#8221;</p>

<p><b>What is the biggest challenge you see for renovating in New York?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of running our workshop, for sure. We have a huge facility where we run a custom cabinetry and millwork shop which we also use for our renovations.</p>
<p><b>Yankees or Mets?</b></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t understand baseball, we&#8217;re Polish—soccer!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Albert</strong></span>: The Empire State building.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in design/construction?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m from Switzerland and I&#8217;ve been in design and construction for 25 years.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get into this field?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m an architect by education. I&#8217;ve worked for prominent international architectural and management firms on major and medium size projects. This allowed me to understand the important advantages of a design-build type of contracts and become a design-build contractor myself.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love most about your work?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m passionate about my work. I love every aspect of it, but I particularly enjoy the design stage and the one-on-one collaboration with my clients. Homes are very personal and private, and commercial spaces are important for a successful business. That is why I encourage homeowners and business owners, who have the time, to be a part of the design process. Most of the time, they appreciate this because it gives them the feeling as though they are building their own place. Giving time and attention to our clients opens the door to a good relationship, promotes good communication, and clarifies the issues in a comprehensive and progressive manner. All these things are crucial for the success of the project.</p>
<p>I also love details. They make a difference in the project and are part of the challenges that much of the time call for special attention and creativity to address them. But the real pleasure is when I start seeing the fruit of so many hours of work and collaboration with my clients taking shape.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your ideal client?</strong><br />
My ideal client is one who is curious enough to get involved in the design process and become a &#8220;partner&#8221; in the project development. To help that happen and as construction progresses, I send my clients pictures with comments and wait for their reactions. They love that! Most of the time, they come back with smileys and/or kind words of approval. But true satisfaction comes when construction is finished, and I see and hear real appreciation from the client.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>What’s the biggest challenge you face when renovating in New York?</strong><br />
Administrative work with the city, building management companies, and/or third party project reviewers who sometimes waste the homeowner&#8217;s time and money and cause unnecessary delays.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</strong><br />
Budget. It is normal that homeowners want to get the best quality for the least cost—until it becomes somewhat unrealistic. We always remind the homeowner that this is New York City and things are expensive. But most importantly, we try to show them what drives cost and why, so they understand that what they are paying is justified by and proportionate with what they are asking to have in their project.</p>
<p>But ultimately, we implement value engineering that helps the homeowner set a list of priorities based on need vs. cost and budget. We walk them through the process of selecting the most important items they need or elements they want to have at the best price possible.</p>
<p><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</strong><br />
I would like the homeowners to know that what we do is real design-build where everything is done in-house. We do not resource design, construction, and management. We take care of the administrative work and obtain all necessary permits to make sure the whole process is seamless, stress-free, and fun.</p>
<p>We manage time in such a way that by the time permits and approvals are acquired, most decisions related to design, equipment, appliances, fixtures, and materials have been made. We also work in 3D as part of our basic cost. We share all of our ideas with our clients in this fashion because we understand that, by definition, homeowners are not construction professionals and they rely on us. So we always go the extra mile to help them see what their space will look like before we put the first hammer in the wall.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City building?</strong><br />
The Hearst Building for being the first NYC Platinum Labelled Green building; Ground Zero Memorial for its poignant architecture that revisits and displays very strongly the emotions of 9/11; 432 Park Avenue for its audacious height vs. its narrow footprint, plus its other successfully resolved technical challenges.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City neighborhood?</strong><br />
The West Village and Soho.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City restaurant?</strong><br />
A Mediterranean shawarma and falafel place that I&#8217;m designing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;I'm originally from Albania.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;">I&#8217;m originally from Albania. </span>I have been in construction for about 10 years and opened up my own company about five years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;How did you get into construction?&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,17153,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,null,1&#093;">How did you get into construction?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;Coming here , moving out here, I guess, everybody seemed to be in construction. I moved here when I was 13 years old, my\u00a0dad worked in construction, and then a lot of people coming in to the US or coming to New York, they-- obviously, this was our entry way to construction. Then I grew up and I went to school, I graduated and part of me was still-- I felt something about construction. So what I did, after graduating, I looked at construction and I said it worked for me. It's something that I really liked, it's something-- building. I guess something about building and then\u00a0getting appreciation for something. Kind of build something and then you get to look\u00a0at it and say, \&quot;Wow.\&quot;\u00a0And then, you get that reaction from the people you're doing it for. So, that's very rewarding for me.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;">I moved to the United States when I was 13 years old. Coming here, everybody seemed to be in construction. </span>My dad worked in construction too, so I grew up with it. Building is something that I&#8217;ve always really liked. When clients look at my work and say, &#8220;Wow,&#8221; it&#8217;s very rewarding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Who is your ideal client?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;Ideal client &#091;laughter&#093;. Somebody whose not going to break my back all the time. No. My ideal client would be somebody who \u00a0 has a vision of what they want to do, and then me bringing in my experience and their vision together. And have a sort of collaboration to making something that maybe hasn't been done before, or creating\u00a0something fun and exciting.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;">I like working with somebody who has a vision of what they want to do, that I can help bring together. I like collaborating with my clients to do something fun and exciting that hasn&#8217;t been done before.</span></p>

<p><strong>Yankees or Mets?</strong></p>
<p><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;I don't even watch baseball, I'm sorry &#091;chuckles&#093;.
