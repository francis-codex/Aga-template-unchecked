<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Assessing a family&#8217;s lifestyle</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My husband, Dave, an information security professional, and I, an ICU physician, moved to New York after my clinical fellowship at Yale. We dragged our two kids to a 1920s two-family house, originally a boarding house, which we gave an initial surge of renovations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fast forward years later, we were really struggling with only one bathroom in the upper unit where we spent most of our time.  Dave and I knew the time had come for an attic remodel on our third floor. It was a quirky, converted attic space of approximately 700 square feet, which contained our three main bedrooms.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="staircase-to-front-porch" class="wp-image-43893 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-Exterior-1.jpg" alt="exterior of house with vinyl siding and staircase and porch with railings after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-Exterior-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-Exterior-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-Exterior-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Fixing a general contractor dead-end</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Informed by local recommendations, we contacted four architects and a few major general contractors. Unfortunately, communication was disjointed, estimates were wildly different, and we kept hitting dead-ends. I was also weary of having contractors’ preference for discussing things with my husband, instead of me, the project’s decision-maker. This whole project was turning into a major headache, and we were discouraged. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-4.jpg" alt="Attic bedrooms" width="1000" height="644" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43894" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-4-300x193.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-4-600x386.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enter Sweeten. A fellow MOP (Mom of Pelham) and Sweeten&#8217;s former CMO, Randi MacColl, had posted one of Sweeten’s recent projects on Facebook. I messaged her with my saga. We were stressed we hadn’t found an architect and then a contractor to execute the plans. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Randi’s patience with my vent was amazing, and her solution was even better. Sweeten’s team literally addressed every frustration we had been facing with this third-floor renovation project. They immediately walked me through setting up a profile to be <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with vetted contractors</a> and supported the entire “dating” process to bring life to our vision of the space. </span></p>
<h3>The wishlist for an attic remodel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That vision was complicated. Space was tight. Storage was minimal. We dreamed of having a master bath in our bedroom. The current bathroom was a crawlspace but the plan was to envelop Dave’s closet to maximize the square footage for a full bath. We requested contractors through Sweeten for just the bath project. In our minds, however, we hoped for so much more—new floors, built-ins, millwork, etc. My husband’s wish list included dealing with a perpetual leak, insulating cold spots, reinforcing weak floorboards, and new windows. And little did I know that he was thinking about exposing the dry-walled chimney. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-5.jpg" alt="Attic bedrooms in Pelham" width="1000" height="696" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43895" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-5-300x209.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-5-600x418.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">They also had to work with an angled ceiling and what was behind it. Fortunately, our Sweeten contractor was all over this.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We met with a very manageable list of contractor/architect pairs and got bids. In the end, we chose our Sweeten contractor because of his <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enthusiasm, experience, innovation</a>, and forthrightness in what he knew and did not know. The project quickly evolved from a single bathroom addition to a full-scale attic remodel, inside and out. A reworked floor plan also accommodated two new doorways. Our contractor suggested innovative built-ins in the master bedroom and the stairwell to maximize our floor space. </span></p>
<h3>Managing a challenging attic remodel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hiccups and crises along the way were numerous (as with any renovation to an old house), but both Sweeten and our contractor supported us through each stressor with patience and transparency. A big uncertainty was whether we could fit a bathroom with adequate height clearance that was compliant with building codes. They also had to work with an angled ceiling and what was behind it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9.jpg" alt="Attic master bedroom" width="1000" height="665" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43898" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-10.jpg" alt="master bedroom storage with slanted ceiling" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, our Sweeten contractor was all over this. A huge skylight helped to create the appearance of height in the space. We installed a custom medicine cabinet with a sloped recessed cabinet, a sink console with an expertly trimmed corner, and sconces from the U.K. to accommodate the hip wall. (I now know more about hip and valley rafters than certain diseases.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We faced another problem with sprinklers, which were required for any third-floor living space renovation. Cost estimates ranged from the manageable to the exorbitant. Our start date was pushed two months late, but our contractors put together a timeline for completion that seemed doable considering we were still living in the space. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the renovation, we moved to the first-floor apartment for six weeks, after which Dave and the kids left for the summer. Adding to the chaos, I was working in the ICU for a lot of the renovation period. Thank goodness for a dependable contractor and Sweeten for doing check-ins when I did not have the bandwidth to deal with anything non-clinical.</span></p>

<h3>Renovation advice from Kusum and Dan</h3>
<p><span class="s1">Reflecting on the project, I offer the following recommendations to other homeowners: a) set clear expectations of each person’s roles, timelines, and constraints; b) establish a mutually agreed upon vehicle/format of communication and a minimum frequency of contact—endless email threads are the worst; c) hire your own cleaning team, as your standards of cleanliness (especially with young kids) may be much more stringent than the contractors; and d) personality match between the contractor and the homeowner is important to make a project successful and enjoyable. </span></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-sonBedroom-7.jpg" alt="Attic bedroom" width="1000" height="710" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43901" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-sonBedroom-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-sonBedroom-7-300x213.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-sonBedroom-7-600x426.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Family comforts for a top-floor attic remodel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, the third floor has turned into a coveted space for our family. There is so much light! With the floors redone, light painting, recessed lighting, and new windows, the entire floor is welcoming and relaxing. My son&#8217;s elevated bed allows for plenty of storage bins underneath. My daughter has the perfect tween transition room, including a desk, privacy, and a creative space. We got a zen master bedroom and an entrance to our “own” bath. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As I stated earlier, the project started with a much more limited scope, but because of code regulations requiring the sprinkler system and the decision to splurge for a significant amount of millwork, we went over budget. We made this decision to do so without pressure because of our Sweeten contractor’s transparency and strong communication. Both Dave and I were able to get all of the items on our wish list!   </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-6.jpg" alt="after of stairway" width="1000" height="1438" class="alignnone wp-image-43896 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-6.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-6-209x300.jpg 209w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-hallway-6-600x863.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This essentially makes this major renovation project #6 for us as a family. To be honest, I think we have at least 2 more to go (just don’t tell Dave). We’ll just <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call Sweeten</a>.</span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Kusum and Dave, for sharing your attic renovation with us!</em></p>

<h3>In need of something bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way and an energetic dog named Alfie, Terri Lee and Brett Appel needed a larger apartment. The couple had a design advantage from the start: Brett runs his own custom residential architecture practice and Terri works for one of the largest architecture firms in New York. They wanted to find something that they could gut renovate and design to their own specifications.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30.jpg" alt="Brett sitting on a chair posing for photo near built-in book shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51517" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A completely gutted remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath apartment was in an 82-unit co-op in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. It was in terrible condition, which made it easier to rip everything out and redesign the apartment exactly the way they wanted. They found their contractor after talking with friends (one of whom is also an architect) who <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had used Sweeten</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08.jpg" alt="open living and dining with hardwood floors and white walls and half wall book shelves as room divider or partition after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51495" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terri and Brett posted their project</a> on Sweeten, they were upfront about the existing conditions and scope of work. They wanted a contractor who would tell them whether the work could be done within their budget, or if they needed to scale back. “Fortunately, we found the right contractor who was very happy to work with us so we could get everything we wanted,” Brett said.</p>

<h3>Making the space look bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple’s design vision was to combine shades of gray with natural wood to make the home seem as bright and large as possible without being too monotone. “We also didn’t want the renovated space to compete with our brightly colored furniture,” Brett said. Their primary objective in terms of gaining space was to add a second bathroom, which they achieved by rearranging the bedroom doors and reducing the size of the hallway closets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02.jpg" alt="dining with white walls and ceiling girder and hardwood floors and half wall book shelf divider partition after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51489" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Challenges in the foyer</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The entry foyer was a bit of a challenge. It’s two steps above the living room and contains the dining space, which was small. They relocated the steps down to the living room from the center to the side and replaced the guardrails with a continuous double-sided built-in bookcase custom-designed by the contractor’s millworker. The raised platform was extended to create a larger dining space, while the closet expanded for more stroller storage. New wide-plank European oak engineered flooring was installed throughout.</p>

<h3>Rearranging the walls</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they found the apartment, the existing walls were plaster—probably at least 60 years old and poorly done. “One of the walls in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room was so uneven and bumpy</a>, it looked like it was made out of pillowcases,” Brett recalled. They ultimately decided to fur out the walls–a process to construct a new wall in front of the old one. “We attached 1x3s to the existing wall and then put new sheetrock on those. We lost a little space (about 1 1/2&#8243; per wall), but this saved us about $6,000,” Brett said. The other option to straighten crooked walls would have been &#8220;demolishing the plaster and lathe, placing new studs, and then new sheetrock,&#8221; which would have been more expensive and time-consuming.</p>

<h3>Covering the radiator</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The master bedroom closet was reframed to function as a walk-in. Other details included the custom radiator covers in the bedroom and living room, crafted by the millworker; leftover stone from the kitchen counters was used for the radiator sills.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Terri and Brett designed these covers together. The existing radiators had an old painted steel cover that had not weathered very well. The millworker made the slatted fronts on removable clips so the radiator could be accessed for maintenance. The new millwork needed a top/windowsill but the couple decided that painted MDF would not last very long. Brett had to purchase two slabs of stone for the kitchen to cover the countertops and backsplash. There was a lot of leftover stone that easily fit the sills.</p>

<h3>An ADA-compliant layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We didn’t have a lot of flexibility designing the kitchen and bathroom layouts. It had to be ADA-compliant since we rearranged everything,” Brett explained. They focused on finishes. In the kitchen, they imagined the countertops and backsplash as the “feature” elements with everything else as the background, &#8220;which is why the floors and cabinets are all different shades of gray,” he said. The couple loves unique, natural stones and found that quartzites have the most movement and veining, which worked well with their gray cabinets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29.jpg" alt="gray bathroom floor tiles and white floating vanity with mirror and toilet and bathtub and floor to ceiling wall tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51516" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Master bath</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both bathrooms were made to seem bigger and brighter by making the walls white and using marble tile in the master and subway tile in the guest. In the master bath, Brett said, he “had some fun connecting the shower niche with the existing windowsill.” Terri scoured the Internet to find an aquatic-themed wallpaper for the guest bathroom. Wood shelves were incorporated in each to provide a little warmth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brett was most excited about the new rain shower in the added bathroom. “All of my previous apartments—for basically my entire life—only had a bathtub, so it feels very luxurious to shower in a large glass box,” he said.</p>

<h3>A recommendation for clients</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the renovation, Brett had wanted to test out Sweeten’s service to see if he would recommend it to his own clients. After this experience, he said he would. “We didn’t need much assistance from Sweeten because I have experience managing projects like these professionally, but I felt reassured knowing that Sweeten would be able to assist if any serious problems came up. Luckily, our contractor was great and we didn’t have any issues,” Brett said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Terri and I are perpetually impressed that we were able to design the apartment exactly to our needs,&#8221; says Brett. &#8220;Our families come over frequently now and we love that we were able to add a second bathroom. It really helps make ‘our’ space feel more private.&#8221; As an architect couple, they worked well together. &#8220;It helps to come up with a central concept or theme at the beginning,&#8221; Brett said. &#8220;There will always be disagreements but we could then ask ourselves &#8216;does this fit our initial vision&#8217; and make a decision together.&#8221;</p>
