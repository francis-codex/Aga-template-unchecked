										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Brooklyn couple chooses a specific layout to design their dream custom kitchen</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Giving new life to an estate-condition kitchen and living room in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Natalie and Cartier had already lived in New York City as renters for several years when they made the decision to make the Big Apple their long-term home. This meant a move from the Upper West Side to Brooklyn, which they preferred for its pace and culture. Rentals were considered but ultimately rejected because of their notoriously small kitchens; the couple loves to cook and needed enough space to work together comfortably. An updated unit in the Clinton Hill Co-ops caught their eye—but unfortunately, they were outbid. Then, having fallen in love with the CHCs (as have many other Sweeten renovators before them!), they realized they could buy one of the units that needed work and have the money to spend on a custom renovation. They made their choice based on the layouts that had space for their ideal custom kitchen. In the unit they selected, everything had to go—the dingy wallpaper and paint, bad tile, and a kitchen that hadn’t been touched in decades. The only thing that would remain were the floors, which would be sanded and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinished</a>. They decided on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a> for the job after posting their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Natalie and Cartier achieved the “modern industrial, open-concept feel” they were looking for by demolishing the walls between the old pantry, living room, dining room, and kitchen. “We wanted a lighter feeling in the apartment, given that the ceiling is not particularly high,” Natalie explained. With less obstruction, the custom kitchen was brightened by the windows in the dining nook and spacious enough for the pair to host dinner parties. They also added plenty of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> for storing all of their kitchen equipment. The sink and dishwasher moved to the wall perpendicular to the stove, allowing their Sweeten contractor to increase counter space and improve the custom kitchen’s overall <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flow</a>. The addition of a built-in <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spice drawer</a> and cabinets with pull-out drawers meant that there was a designated spot for their kitchen goods—from small appliances to pots and pans. With many moving parts, Natalie and Cartier relied on Christina, their Sweeten Planner, to help stay on top of their renovation in real time throughout their home&#8217;s transformation. They even received a comprehensive digital record documenting their three-month renovation at completion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Cartier was keen on having a “smart” home, so the living room air conditioning and many lights are connected via Wi-Fi and controlled by the Echo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Cemento Cassero Anthracite floor tiles: <a href="https://www.arizonatile.com/en/products/porcelain-and-ceramic/cemento-cassero" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arizona Tile</a>.

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23735 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog-723x482.jpg" alt="spice rack for storage" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07_cropped_for_blog.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you&#8217;re like most cooks, you have a medley of spice containers in your kitchen, including some duplicates because it&#8217;s easy to forget what you already own when out food shopping. Spice storage is becoming a frequent request</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">wall niches or built-in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinetry</a>—to <span class="s1">house these valuable ingredients. Those renovating have a prime opportunity to factor this into planning their kitchen layouts because </span>the last thing you want to do is fumble around for the paprika with a hot pan on the stove. To kick your spice game up a notch, here are 5 creative ideas from Sweeten homeowners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-15-16.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23716 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-15-16.gif" alt="spice rack for storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-apartment-gets-dose-luxury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabio and Melina&#8217;s</a> renovated kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After dealing with past kitchens that lacked storage, Fabio and Melina wanted their new kitchen to have plenty of it, especially since they both love to cook. Concealed pantry storage was built around the fridge and a pull-out drawer was added for storing spices. The spice drawer lives inside the upper lip of a much deeper drawer filled with baking essentials, maximizing the storage potential of the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23717 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="spice rack for storage" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Open shelving in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua&#8217;s</a> Sweeten kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Joshua’s kitchen, once small and cramped, needed to fit two cooks working side by side. The old kitchen was filled with unexpected nooks and crannies, a design dilemma that would be best served by custom cabinetry. To mix it up, open shelving was added, presenting the perfect solution for storing spices and cookbooks near the stove.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23718 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="Spice rack niche" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/tired-hudson-heights-home-reveals-stylish-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jessica and David&#8217;s</a> spice storage niche</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jessica and David decided to build a new closet along the wall separating their dining room from the kitchen so that they could use the dining room space as a bedroom in the future. Although the placement of the closet cut a chunk out of the kitchen, they were able to take back some of the lost space by carving out a niche with plenty of shelves for storing spices. As a bonus, the convenient storage also makes it easy for them to keep track of what they have in stock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23722 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="spice rack custom cabinetry" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Custom cabinet in <a href="https://sweeten.com/clintonhillcoops/ketrinas-sweetened-clinton-hill-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ketrina&#8217;s</a> Sweeten kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In building out Ketrina’s formerly tiny kitchen with new custom cabinets, bonus upper and lower units were added to the design to make better use of the space and hide some pipes. One such cabinet placed between the stove and the window was the perfect size to store spices, proving that every inch counts when it comes to boosting storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23723 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" alt="Pull-out spice rack" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Pull-out spice rack in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/newlywed-writers-turn-dark-kitchen-bestseller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda&#8217;s</a> Sweeten kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work-from-home writers Amanda and her husband cook often and wanted a kitchen in which they&#8217;d feel comfortable working in together. With a sizable collection of seasonings, a pull-out spice rack was added next to the stove and cleverly concealed as cabinetry, making it easy for both cooks to have what they need when the recipe calls for it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thought maybe the lighting was off in the “before” photos, but it turns out this Kensington kitchen really was coated in olive green&#8230; in all directions! On a mission to renovate quickly after buying the place, a Brooklyn family came to Sweeten for clever kitchen renovations plus some bonus dining room storage. Read on for Brandi’s take on making this space a home for a growing family.</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/brandis-kensington-kitchen-dining-room-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16783" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/brandi-kitchen-1.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation kensington" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/brandi-kitchen-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/brandi-kitchen-1-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Brandi, Brooklyn homeowner</span></i><span id="more-16765"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We bought our Kensington co-op apartment about a year ago, knowing we’d need a full kitchen renovation. The apartment had a wall oven that did not work, and the cabinets had so many layers of paint on them, the hinges wouldn&#8217;t close. Not to mention they were painted a horrifying olive green. The backsplash was cracked and yellowing, the floor tiles were beige-y pink (and also cracked), and all of the appliances needed updating. And because it is a galley kitchen and not very big, we wanted extra storage space in the dining room.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16782" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Brandi_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Brandi_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Brandi_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Brandi_Kitchen-Before-01-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We didn&#8217;t have that many ideas when we first started. I knew it would be clean and mostly white, I wanted glass tiles for the backsplash, some sort of natural stone counter, and I wanted a fridge with the freezer on the bottom. Also, the kitchen is in the middle of the apartment so we were looking for ways to bring more light in. A lovely neighbor had shown us how well L-shaped wall cut-outs could work to brighten and enlarge the space, so</span> we started with that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little by little we pieced together a plan, just through doing research on places like Sweeten and Pinterest and looking at what we liked and what we didn&#8217;t. </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3362">We decided to post our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten, and were matched with </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2536" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Paul</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We spoke to a few contractors and he was the one who had the most creative and constructive feedback on early design plans. For instance, he didn&#8217;t automatically agree with me on how we should assemble the cabinets in the dining room (I initially wanted high wall cabinets which we later scrapped), and ultimately we took his suggestions and he was right. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ended up choosing marbled cork floors, white lacquer IKEA cabinets with modern pulls, bright granite counters, sea green glass backsplash tiles, and stainless steel appliances. Our favorite features are the undercabinet lighting, the easy access spice drawer, and the slightly larger stainless steel sink.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul built the dining room console with IKEA cabinets and granite counters, which gives us just the right amount of storage without taking over the whole room. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The floor tiles were my idea; I loved that they are earth friendly, good for the back and knees, and fairly inexpensive. We had our eye on a different tile but when it came time to purchase, they were out of stock so we made a last minute trip to Lumber Liquidators a week before work began and found another design we liked. They look fine, but I did learn that cork has a major drawback: just a year later you can see the wear and tear on them, with pieces of the veneer flaking off around the edges. Not hugely noticeable, but buyer beware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also regretted ordering cabinets through IKEA. Yes &#8212; it was much cheaper than anywhere else, but about half of the cabinet doors and drawer fronts we ordered were out of stock for about six months (and this was from their brand-new cabinet line!). Over those six months, we probably made the trip to IKEA 15 times; we were frequently told that items were in for pick up, only to arrive and find out they were not actually there. We tried to order pieces online and then received the wrong things. </span>Paul was incredible, and it was not his fault that the cabinet orders were so off, but it was a big hold-up over the course of several months and we ended up assembling half the cabinet fronts ourselves. The cabinets do look great, and we are so grateful to Paul &#8211; we loved working with him!</p>
