<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening a physical brick-and-mortar store is a bold and energizing step. It’s a chance to create a walk-in version of&nbsp;a business you’ve been&nbsp;growing, or&nbsp;a tangible&nbsp;realization of a long-awaited vision to be your own boss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail renovation costs<span>—</span>for, say, a clothing or beauty boutique, yoga studio or art gallery can slide from pricey to economical&#8230;depending on what you want. Chain Store Age’s annual survey of retail build-outs put the average cost at $56.53 per square foot. If you use that formula, then it will cost $280,000 for a 5,000-square-foot store build-out. In another example, an entrepreneur in Austin, Texas, only spent $7,650 on a build-out for Little Green Beans, a children’s consignment store for clothing and toys, according to <a href="https://www.inc.com/articles/201108/business-start-up-costs-retail-store.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inc.</a>&nbsp;(The business owner&#8217;s breakdown of costs were: $4,000 construction to customize the space, $3,500 for shelves, racks, etc., and a mere $150 for a handyman).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t be too overwhelmed by this figure. As the name suggests, the&nbsp;above survey takes into account bigger stores that are more commonly found in malls than a Main Street space in an older building. A simple build-out for a smaller store<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>minor construction, a coat of paint, shelves, and racks<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>can cost under $10,000. It all depends on the scope of work and what finishes you want.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To figure out this wide world of retail build-out budgets for your project, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractors, offers a few areas to consider.<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<h3><strong>Design for a commercial storefront space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you choose to hire a designer or architect (not everyone does), expect that to take 20 percent of your renovation budget, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Carla</a>. That could mean $40,000 in a $200,000 budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail projects can be as small as custom shelving for storing product, using existing electrical wiring, and&nbsp;applying&nbsp;a fresh coat of paint. With a build-out that basic, you might avoid the need for permits, thus eliminating the need for blueprints to be approved by an architect. However, if you’re serious about optimizing the size of your space and carefully planning the customer experience, then it&#8217;s best to bring in the big guns. “What do you want the customers to experience? What do you want them to see when they first walk in?” said Carla. Then there are the more technical design elements like handicap accessibility and whether or not you need a bathroom. These are best handled by an architect.</p>
<h3><strong>Electrical costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Chain Store Age survey put the cost of interior lighting at $3.30 a square foot. As mentioned above, electrical can be kept simple by using existing wiring and even fixtures to keep these costs down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott, another Sweeten contractor</a>, has worked on retail build-outs where electrical has been as low as $10,000 or as high as $100,000. Splurges in lighting often come from a client wanting specific light fixtures that are in line with their brand. Altering the position of each light to highlight store product or fixing up existing, decrepit wiring could increase your budget for electrical. Once you get into more serious work, your project might also require the additional cost of applying for permits that could also delay your timeline, Scott said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And it isn’t just lighting that needs to be considered. If your business has additional power needs, such as a salon or a dog groomer with equipment like hair dryers, it is best to assess what power burden your ideal store location can handle before signing a lease. That way, you can either find another location or factor in an electrical upgrade into your budget if necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cjJnJjIEXOM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40884 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Plumbing costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p>This area of the budget will largely depend on:</p>
<p>A. Is there is a bathroom?</p>
<p>B. If no, then would you like a bathroom?</p>
<p>C. If you have one, will it stay in the same place?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a bathroom, then it is possible to freshen it up with a coat of paint. If there is no bathroom, you should consider if it will help your business and your staff (otherwise they might have to close the store whenever they need to use a restroom). “You want to keep customers in your store rather than give them a reason to leave,” said Scott, on why a bathroom might help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A very basic bathroom could set you back $3,000 to $6,000, according to <a href="https://home.costhelper.com/bathroom-addition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost Helper</a>. It could attract additional costs if the location is far from water and sewage lines and if you need the help from a structural engineer. A plumbing permit will also be needed. Moving a bathroom will gather similar costs with the added line item of demolition. If your business has unique needs like a washing station for a hair salon, that will be another cost to factor in.</p>
<h3><strong>Flooring and ceiling costs&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a retail build-out, flooring on average takes up $2.76 per square foot in a budget and ceilings take $1.81, according to Chain Store Age. If there are no structural issues with the flooring (again, check your lease to ensure the landlord is responsible for these costs), then what you do to the floors will likely just be cosmetic. If that is the case—you&#8217;re re-varnishing existing floors or laying some tiles—then the project likely won’t require a permit, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin,&nbsp;a Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>HVAC costs in commercial spaces</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of either fixing, replacing or installing an HVAC system costs on average about $2.61 per square foot or about $13,000 for a 5,000-square-foot space. Like everything else, this average can swing in either direction based on what you have, what you want, and what you can afford.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One way to avoid this cost entirely is to negotiate a lease that puts the responsibility of the HVAC system onto the landlord, according to Colin. As an alternative, you can volunteer to take care of the HVAC system and request that the landlord give you three months of free rent. If it is a simple step of replacing the air conditioning unit with something modern, it likely won’t require a permit, said Scott.</p>
<h3><strong>Millwork costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On average, retail build-outs spend almost $10 a square foot on display fixtures or millwork, according to the Chain Store Age survey. That’s roughly 20 percent of an average budget. But of course, it all depends on your vision for your store.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three factors that determine how expensive your displays will be are material, quantity, and what space they need to fit into, Scott said. The cost of simple wood from Home Depot will pale in comparison to teak from Brazil. Spaces, especially older ones, can also have quirks in them that need to be incorporated into the design of your shelving. “There can be a lot of bends and cuts that you have to fit the wood to,” said Scott. “That can consume a lot of time and add more to the cost.”</p>
<h3><strong>Paint costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting to the paint stage means you are close to the finish line. Your walls need to be prepared first, which might be your priciest point, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Another element that will affect your paint budget is if the color is flat, which is generally a better value than a semi-gloss. Also, the darker the color, the more coats of paint you will need, Bill said.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Real-world retail example</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To put things in perspective, here is an actual retail renovation budget for a New York beauty salon from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Paul</a>:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Commercial_reno_budget_retail.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26944 mb-0 size-chrono" title="actual NYC beauty salon renovation estimate / 1,130 sq ft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Commercial_reno_budget_retail-723x533.jpg" alt="retail renovation cost" width="723" height="533"></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening a physical store is an exciting moment for a business. Whether it&#8217;s a simple build-out or one with more moving parts, there&#8217;s a path for you to bring your storefront into the spotlight.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Welcome to #15 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a> with any reno questions or dilemmas you’d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: Why should I move out during my renovation? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>The answer is, because you love yourself, and you want to stay healthy. There are so many airborne particles in the air during a renovation, from paint to sometimes, asbestos. We highly recommend that people <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">move out of the space when they&#8217;re gut renovating</a>, although it&#8217;s not necessary for every project or to move out for the entire time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If, for some reason, you can&#8217;t, whether it&#8217;s financial or otherwise, we suggest that you put some kind of vapor barrier between the space where you are living and where the renovation is happening. You want to make sure that you are healthy throughout your entire renovation. Think about it: while someone is demoing, they usually have a mask on and they also leave the property. You don&#8217;t want to be sleeping in a room filled with dust particles. We definitely suggest to at least move out of your space during the dusty demolition phase.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Jean-Signature-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-35417"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-35417" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Jean-Signature-1-723x387.jpg" alt="Jean-Signature (1)" width="723" height="387" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen island is a highly versatile unit; it can provide storage—think one large cabinet!—a work surface, or serve as a transition between two living areas. Here are <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five of our favorites</a>.</p>

<p><span class="img-label"><em>Nancy and Aram&#8217;s </em><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/head-turner-bathroom-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>bathroom renovation</em></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The shower has, at last, stepped up next to the tub—separate and equal—to become a focal point in the bath. However, there’s more to a fabulous shower experience than a multi-spray <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/shower-heads-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower head</a> and pretty tiled walls. You will also want to consider the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower door</a>, which sets the tone for the shower’s overall appearance and harmony with your bath’s décor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spa-like and almost invisible? Check. Framed and architecturally attention-worthy? Check. As you research and shop, you’ll find a shower door to suit every bathing enclosure and décor. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors, surveys the factors involved in selecting a shower door to better inform you as you research this important feature.</p>
<h3>Glass shower doors: Getting started</h3>
<p>You may decide to place the shower next to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tub</a> because it looks nice, or because you don’t want to make major changes to the water lines. Perhaps you only need a shower in a space with limited square footage, so you want to put it in the corner. Wherever the shower ends up, your design will require one of the following door mounting options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Framed shower doors</li>
<li>Semi-frameless shower doors</li>
<li>Frameless shower doors</li>
<li>Freestanding shower doors</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The style you choose can be based mostly on your taste. However, before committing, you will want to consult with your contractor to assess the bathroom space for quirks. After all, not all bathrooms are made alike: dimensions vary from ceiling to floor, plumbing lines wander, walls and floors are not always plumb. Your contractor can help you determine the best location for the shower, including making sure that the walls can bear the weight of frameless shower doors.</p>

<h3>Styles for glass shower doors</h3>
<p>The door you select will depend not only on your preferences as to the style and movement of the door but also any space restrictions. Is there room for the door to swing open? Or can the width handle sliding doors? Placement of controls on one or two walls and the width and height of the shower enclosure will also factor in. Consider the following options:</p>
<h4>Sliding shower doors</h4>
<p>Two panels fit in a frame and slide in either direction to open and close.</p>

<h4>Swing or pivot shower doors</h4>
<p>A single pane attached to a wall swings open from the left or right.</p>
<h4>Door and panel</h4>
<p>One narrow pane is fixed to the wall while next to it, a panel is fixed with hinges to the other wall and operates as the door.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-24-600x900.jpg" alt="garage shower" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-46481" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-24-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-24-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-24.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><em>A door-and-panel style shower door in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaime Ray Newman&#8217;s bathroom</a></em></p>
<h4>Butterfly or bi-fold doors</h4>
<p>Two equal-size panels are hinged at the center to open inward.</p>
<h4>Fixed shower doors</h4>
<p>A single pane of glass attached to the wall holding the showerhead protects the bathroom from splashes; the rest of the shower opening remains uncovered.</p>
<h3>Shower door mounting options</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, framed was the only way to go. (Remember those shower doors when you were growing up?) With the widespread popularity of open design, semi-frameless shower doors and frameless showers have caught homeowners&#8217; attention. Improvements in mounting systems, including thicker glass supported by sleeker, stronger hinges, means you can have a shower that seems to float or even disappear. Your choices come down to four solutions:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Framed shower doors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This product features a metal frame around all four edges of the operating doors. In addition, metal channels framing the shower opening allow for hinges that attach swinging doors or the gliding motion of sliding doors. Framed glass doors are created to fit standard shower openings. The appearance doesn’t have to be standard, though. Manufacturers offer a range of looks, from super contemporary clean-lined chrome to matte black in a windowpane pattern from Coastal Shower Doors that will conjure your own private Downton Abbey. Duravit makes a glass enclosure with two self-locking doors that fold against either wall when not in use, so the shower disappears entirely.</p>
<p>Special details notwithstanding, framed doors can be the thriftiest way to go and the easiest to install. The glass panes are typically 1/4-inch thick</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Semi-frameless shower doors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Semi-frameless shower doors may include framing around the entire shower opening, but not around the actual door panels. It also typically features 1/4-inch glass. Semi-frameless doors lend themselves to some creative trends in headers, like exposed industrial-style hardware with rollers and bars that suggest barn door hardware.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Frameless shower doors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not completely without hardware, frameless is still the way to go if you want an open, seamless, truly spa-like effect for your shower. Advances in hardware engineering and glass manufacturing make this type of installation appear to float. Glass panels attach to hinges that then attach to walls. There is commonly a combo of a fixed panel and a swinging door, both made of 5/8-inch safety glass. Besides the hinges, the only hardware is the door handle and possibly a towel bar, though after going to all this trouble, why would you want anything to block the view?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1-600x900.jpg" alt="bathroom skylight" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-49434" style="font-size: 16px;" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><em>A nearly-invisible frameless shower door in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy and Kevin&#8217;s L.A. bathroom</a></em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Freestanding shower doors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the very high end, you will find freestanding shower enclosures. They consist of a shower pan with a four-sided metal framework in which glass panels fit, one of them a door. Drummonds, an English manufacturer, makes several models for the United States market. If you can afford the hefty price tag, you can have this shower up and working in a couple of hours.</p>
<h3>Finishes for glass shower doors</h3>
<p>Finally, you will choose a finish for the frame and its accompanying pieces—hinges and hardware. A good rule of thumb is to choose the finish that matches your shower head and any other shower fittings, like a hand shower or jets. Of course, the choice is up to you, and here, too, is a range—brushed, nickel, oil-rubbed bronze, and ever-popular chrome.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All edges of your shower door should arrive finished or polished. Styles for the appearance of the flat surface include:</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Opaque shower door</b><b>s</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A holdover from the previous century, opaque shower doors are good for those seeking privacy. Ask to see a manufacturer’s offerings in this category, which can range from pebbled to brushed to the appearance of raindrops.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Clear glass shower doors</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These remain a strong trend in bathrooms. Rightly so: they promote the open appearance in a bath while showing off sleek shower fittings and surface treatments of tile or stone.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Tinted glass shower doors</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are created during the manufacturing process and come in subtle, natural tones like gray, bronze, and blue. As a bonus, they complement America&#8217;s favorite bathroom color—white—as well as stone, tile, and metals for faucets and showerheads, and controls.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Etched glass</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Etched glass shower doors permit privacy with opaque designs etched onto clear glass. Patterns available can be figurative, like images from nature, or abstract. Custom designs will cost you more and must be specially ordered. The etching is on the outside face of the shower.</p>
<h3>Glass shower doors: Thickness &amp; durability</h3>
<p>The less framework for the door, the thicker the glass. Standard glass shower doors come 1/2- or 3/8-inch thick; frameless doors should be 5/8-inch thick. All must be made of safety glass, which shatters into small pieces when broken, not into lethal shards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The shower door—a seemingly small yet often overlooked feature—makes a huge impact on the look and feel of your bathroom. As you make your decision, think about how you shower, and what’s important to you as you experience your daily bathroom rituals. You want the shower to feel like it’s part of the of the bathroom. The right glass shower door can do that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Sweeten&#8217;s top 10 reno trends we predict will continue strong</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-Trends-Graphic-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33607 mb-0 size-chrono" title="home design trends for 2018" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-Trends-Graphic-1-723x723.jpg" alt="home design trends for 2018" width="723" height="723" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovators this year embraced trends new and old, from fresh takes to a more classic approach. Read on to see what made the cut.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sliding-Doors.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29449 size-chrono" title="white-barn-door-brick-wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sliding-Doors.gif" alt="white barn door near brick wall and large window and brown floor tiles after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>SLIDING DOORS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A door can be more than just an entry from one room to another; it can take an open plan apartment and turn it into multiple, private spaces. Sliding doors add flexibility to spaces of all sizes, making rooms magically appear as if out of thin air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/">Miguel</a> got rid of a wall of closets and relocated the storage to the bedroom, installing a wardrobe on rollers that could also function as a door; glass-paneled partitions allowed <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/queens-condo-overhaul-begins-with-kitchen-sink/">Sarah and Craig</a> to create a second bedroom in their apartment without blocking the light from a wall of windows; to transition their office into a guest bedroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/general-contractors-dream-apartment/">Ana and Leo</a> opted for a set of white, sliding doors that have the appearance of a solid wall when closed.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Walls-Turned-Peninsula.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29453 size-chrono" title="walls turned into peninsulas" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Walls-Turned-Peninsula.gif" alt="walls turned into peninsulas" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>WALLS-TURNED-PENINSULA</h3>
<p>“Where there’s a wall, there’s a way” isn’t technically a saying, but it works well to describe how homeowners have been opening up their kitchens by chopping a wall in half. The move makes your kitchen feel much larger and boosts prep, storage, and dining space.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-becomes-a-workflow-masterpiece/">Lisa and Chris’</a> tiny kitchen, the close walls made it feel tight and restricted—until they turned one wall into a peninsula; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/before-after-kaija-and-johns-prospect-heights-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/">Kaija and John</a> did the same in their space and topped it with a poured concrete countertop; and so did <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/">Dan and Mike</a>, adding stylish wood paneling for a touch of contrast.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Multi-Comfort-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29469 size-chrono" title="gray-bedroom-blue-bedcover" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Multi-Comfort-2.gif" alt="gray bedroom with blue bedcover and gray fireplace after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>MULTI-COMFORT</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(Air quality/Soundproofing)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes, the most comfortable elements of your home are the least noticeable, like air conditioning that keeps the summer heat at bay or soundproofing that elevates the coziness factor in bedrooms. When you’re thinking of new features to add to your home, like hardwood flooring or a marble countertop, don’t forget to make comfort a priority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new HVAC system found a spot at the top of the renovation checklist in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry&#8217;s</a> 130-year-old brownstone; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/deniz-ramons-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deniz and Ramon</a> added soundproofing to two walls in their kitchen to prevent noise from leaking into the bedroom; and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/original-details-brooklyn-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah</a> chose solid core doors for the nursery so her girls can snooze away while she entertains right outside their door.<b><br />
</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-29446 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Wall-Hung-Toilet.gif" alt="Wall-Hung-Toilet" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>WALL-HUNG TOILETS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The toilet may not be the prettiest feature, but no bathroom is complete without one. When it comes to selecting one for your space, wall-hung toilets have a lot going for them, from the nearly non-existent footprint to the ease of cleaning below and around the unit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-gets-a-nordic-look-for-bathrooms-and-closets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Felix’s</a> Scandinavian-styled powder room, the wall-hung toilet blends in seamlessly with her minimal design; the unit in <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alicia and Ed’s</a> downstairs bathroom fades into the background so that the classic trough sink can take center stage; and in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/bathroom-remodel-injects-personality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meredith and Jason’s</a> small master bath, the toilet takes up very little room, allowing them to gain back seven inches of floor space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Skim-Coating.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29448 size-chrono" title="white-open-book-shelf-large-window" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Skim-Coating.gif" alt="white open book shelf near large window and breakfast nook with white round table and brown wooden floor after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>SKIM COATING</h3>
<p>Although the process costs more than a simple color change, skim coating greatly improves the appearance of walls. Think of it as stretching a fresh piece of canvas for your masterpiece instead of painting on top of an older artwork.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-bookcases-prewar-home/">Cat and Jordan</a> took this extra step to reach the goal of making their apartment “look as big, bright, and clean as possible”; the walls that weren’t demo&#8217;ed in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/apartment-party-four-five/">Sam and Sean’s</a> kitchen got a much-needed facelift; in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/">Lauren’s</a> studio, she followed her contractor’s advice to skim coat the walls and ceiling to repair the uneven surface and hide bowed beams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Patterned-Floor-Tile.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29454 size-chrono" title="patterned-hexagon-black-floor-tiles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Patterned-Floor-Tile.gif" alt="patterned hexagon black floor tiles and a gray vanity in a bthroom with white subway tiles after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>PATTERNED FLOOR TILE</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bathroom design doesn’t have to be boring; patterned floor tile brings color and interest, regardless of square footage. Go for the unexpected with contrasting grout, a pop of color, or a new twist on classic stone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikki and Chris</a> took inspiration from their favorite New York restaurant bathrooms with black hex tile and white grout; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/an-architect-drafts-a-travel-inspired-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erin and Brian</a> chose a colorful blue mosaic tile; and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/blueprint-comes-life-family-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tina and Fletcher</a> took marble to another level with a graphic basketweave pattern.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/His-and-Her-Bathrooms-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29470 size-chrono" title="white-bathroom-beige-vanity" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/His-and-Her-Bathrooms-2.gif" alt="white bathroom tiles in a large bathroom with beige floating vanity and white double sink after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>SEPARATE (OR SHARED) BATHROOMS FOR COUPLES</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you have two bathrooms or just one master, designing a stylish space to meet the needs of two people is possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/">Leslie</a> combined two bathrooms in her home to create a large, luxurious space and installed an extra-wide mirror and double sink vanity; in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/">Cecilia and Jonathan&#8217;s</a> individual bathrooms, Cecilia wanted a bright, classic space, and incorporated plenty of marble, while Jonathan used stone to make his space resemble a spa; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/">Meg and Brett</a> went with a Kohler slop sink for two circa 1948 and a custom vanity.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Blue-Kitchen-Cabinets.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29460 size-chrono" title="blue-kitchen-cabinets-large-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Blue-Kitchen-Cabinets.gif" alt="blue kitchen cabinets in a large kitchen with white subway tiled backsplash and a small kitchen island after renovation" width="723" height="483" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>BLUE KITCHEN CABINETS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping kitchens cool is as simple as adding the color blue. In Victorian times, it was believed that a touch of blue in the wall paint would help regulate the room’s temperature. Although the motivation has changed, this moody hue has made a triumphant return.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tina and Fletcher</a> redesigned their kitchen with navy cabinets painted in Newburyport Blue by Benjamin Moore; mixing white and blue cabinets add a layer of depth to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mollie&#8217;s</a> space; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/claire-mikes-park-slope-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claire and Mike</a> selected Evening Dove by Benjamin Moore, a bold color choice, which helps define the kitchen from the living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Waterfall-Countertops.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29463 size-chrono" title="waterfall countertops" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Waterfall-Countertops.gif" alt="waterfall countertops" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>WATERFALL COUNTERTOPS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing is more elegant in the kitchen than a waterfall counter. The look elevates an island from a purely functional piece into a sculptural feature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/">Amy and Nick</a> splurged on Carrara marble for their kitchen showpiece; <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/">Alicia and Ed</a> refined the edge of their peninsula with a Caesarstone counter in Statuario Nuvo; Carrara marble made another appearance in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/">Lia and Chris&#8217;</a> space to cap the end of the U-shaped layout, a suggestion from their Sweeten contractor.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Paneled-Fridges-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29471 size-chrono" title="large-white-paneled-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Paneled-Fridges-2.gif" alt="large white paneled cabinets for refrigerator after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>PANELED REFRIGERATORS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t want your refrigerator to be the focal point of your kitchen? Disguise it with custom paneling and let the other features of your space shine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-lightens-up-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ainsley and Simon&#8217;s</a> contractor proposed tucking their fridge into an existing column; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavi and David</a> concealed their appliances among flat-front cabinets; to preserve the classic design of her prewar apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claudia</a> chose custom paneling trimmed with molding.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When Anne and Michael moved into their two-bed, one-bath apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops, the space was in need of an overhaul. Wisely, the couple decided to live with the kitchen for a couple of months to understand how to customize the space to their needs. They moved into the bedrooms but kept the living room and kitchen fairly empty. “We felt it was a plus to live in the space for a minute before diving into our first renovation, even if the space did feel quite sparse at times.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">The great views and natural light from the big windows became the focal point. In contrast, the small, cut-off kitchen was saddled with an outdated color palette and cheap materials: wood-paneled cabinets, a busily speckled countertop, and pink square floor tiles that brought out an unflattering orange hue in the cabinets. The two small doorways leading into the kitchen created an awkward flow and isolated the space from the rest of the apartment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">Anne and Michael <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> on Sweeten after being stuck in a “contractor no man’s land.” They had spoken to handymen who felt the scope of the project was too ambitious for their skills, while contractors they met only wanted to take on larger and more costly projects. “Neither of these options felt right. Sweeten was great; we posted the project and the budget and got serious responses from contractors specifically interested in a project of our size. Filling out the Sweeten project form helped us to clarify the specs of the renovation for ourselves as well.” This <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a> turned out to be just the right fit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: A reconfiguration of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor plan</a> eliminated the two small entrances and created a new, U-shaped kitchen that opened up into the dining space. This allowed more light into the kitchen while maintaining a separate cooking area. Anne and Michael also traded in the orange-brown-pink for a more subdued and calming color scheme. &#8220;Our contractor helped us source our appliances, counters, and backsplash tile, which we found really helpful as first-timers,&#8221; says Anne. Shaker-style cabinets were semi-custom in a cool, soft gray and paired with a backsplash made of small-scale white tile laid in a diamond pattern. After some delays and frustrations with the cabinets, they almost wondered if stock cabinets would have been the better decision. However, their contractor was patient and worked to get them back to a happy place—while still on budget. A full-length <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pantry</a> alongside the French door refrigerator adds much-needed storage space.  Their advice for future renovators? &#8220;It is such a cliché, but it&#8217;s going to take longer than you anticipate,&#8221; said Anne. They also <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved out</a> during demolition. &#8220;We thought about muddling through and continuing to camp out in the bedrooms, but I think the work got done more quickly this way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Having lived with compact appliances in a small rental kitchen, they were thrilled they could fit full-sized appliances AND the storage they wanted in their new kitchen. “We just hosted Thanksgiving for ten people, and the kitchen really worked from a storage and counter space perspective. It&#8217;s exciting to be able to host like that in our new home.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An age-old material adds texture to any space</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some structural elements of a home can offer a peek into its past. Consider the brick wall, a material brimming with warmth and character that&#8217;s steeped in history. With <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors—these five homeowners uncovered this long-forgotten detail hiding behind the walls of their homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27228 mb-0 size-chrono" title="exposed brick in the dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="exposed brick" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While renovating the downstairs bath, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alicia and Ed’s</a> contractor discovered well-preserved brick along one wall. The revelation encouraged the couple to see if the material in the living room was in just as good condition. After ripping down the sheetrock and finding beautiful brick, the couple fell in love with the feature and said that unearthing it was worth the expense and impact on the timeline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-24689" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a loft apartment that was once a carriage house, exposed brick was the focal point of the living room. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meg and Brett</a> loved it and wanted to see what else lurked behind the walls. Wherever the drywall was hollow, they drilled a hole to see what lay underneath. The process allowed the couple to find brick, beams, and columns, which they worked to expose. Not only did the original architecture reveal the home’s provenance, but some of the beams had initials carved in them, and a horsehair or two caught within the wood!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28813 size-chrono" title="exposed brick" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="exposed brick" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28935 mb-0 size-chrono" title="painted brick" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="exposed brick" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fixing electrical components in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miguel’s</a> apartment led his contractor to uncover brick that started in the bedroom and continued through the living room and kitchen. The apartment lacked charm before the discovery, feeling more like a white box than a proper home. Miguel jumped at the chance to show off the brick, leaving it in its natural state in the bedroom, and adding white paint in the living room where the material was of poor quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21670 size-chrono" title="exposed brick in the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-08-8-723x1085.jpg" alt="Plants and exposed brick wall" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/fashion-designer-renovates-match-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine</a> planned on keeping her apartment minimalist in design, but rather than painting the exposed brick white to match her floors, she left them bare. The rough-hewn surfaces add a natural quality, anchoring the sparse decor and color palette. With the brick in the living room, Christine took inspiration from a Moroccan riad—a traditional style of house with an interior garden—and filled the space with greenery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Giovanni_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28936 mb-0 size-chrono" title="brick structural wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Giovanni_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg" alt="exposed brick" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to swap his high-rise home for something with history, <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/tired-kitchen-gets-jumpstart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giovanni</a> found a studio apartment in an old townhouse in Brooklyn. The walls were covered in plaster, but Giovanni remained hopeful that bricks might lay beneath the surface. His contractor was able to uncover structural brick by breaking off the plaster, instantly restoring the lost charm and character of the home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Original flooring sets the color tone, while hidden storage provide max capabilities</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-26840" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Treanna_Kitchen-02-07.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Treanna_Kitchen-02-07" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Adding storage and style to a haphazard kitchen in Manhattan’s Upper East Side</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When Treanna embarked on the search for her new home, she knew that apartments within her budget would probably require a remodel of some kind. She set out to find one in which she would only need to redo one of the two big-ticket items—the kitchen or bath—but not both. When she saw the kitchen in her current apartment, located in a 1960s co-op building on the Upper East Side, she spotted a lot of underutilized space and a lot of potential. There was enough room for a full galley, while the current owners had only one wall of cabinets and appliances with a lone undersized fridge on the other side. All the appliances were rental-grade, and there was no dishwasher—a must for this enthusiastic home chef. The few cabinets that existed were mismatched, and the space flow was not good. As she closed on the apartment, Treanna <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached out to Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted contractors, and selected her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: While almost everything in the old kitchen had to go, Treanna found charm in the existing checkered black-and-white flooring, and it became the basis for the new color palette. She envisioned a calm, serene space in white and gray—anything dark would make the galley space feel too confined. “Open, inviting, and warm,” were the operative terms for the updated kitchen design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the guidance of her Sweeten design-build contractor, Treanna chose white <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a>, a light-colored Caesarstone <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertop</a> with a bit of marbling, and a backsplash in clear and white tile (although the gray grout tinted the look of the clear tiles). Minimalist hardware in stainless steel finished the look. Working with just 42 square feet, Treanna and her contractor outfitted the space with ample storage by adding four custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-out racks</a> in addition to numerous drawers. The stainless steel range and dishwasher were installed on one side, while the microwave and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/refrigerator-chill-world-fridge-freezer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refrigerator</a> went on the opposite wall. Although the remodel took much longer than expected due to delays with co-op approval, Treanna is loving her new space—especially the pull-outs and the handy Delta touch faucet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Instead of wasting the dead space behind the cabinet toe kicks, the Sweeten contractor added additional drawer space and an ingenious pull-out step stool on wheels. Treanna had trouble reaching the top shelves in the kitchen and this was a way to keep a step ladder out of sight but easily accessible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Vivid proof there’s more to kitchen design than all-white</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There&#8217;s a reason why so many renovators prefer neutrals. Soft shades of cream and linen, or cloud-gray and pewter, never go out of style. But they can also feel a little flat. Injecting a bright color into your space adds a splash of personality. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors—outlines some of our favorite ways that homeowners have brought color into their kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23361 mb-0 size-chrono" title="teal backsplash and walnut cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen color ideas" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-sheds-deli-style-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janna and Jeremy&#8217;s</a> kitchen, the only storage options were a shelving unit and one, lonely cabinet that had to do the work of a full set. “We joked that it looked like a corner deli,” Janna reminisces. A patterned teal backsplash provides just enough interest—in addition to walnut cabinets—to take the kitchen from deli-style to dazzling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Matthieu_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25799 mb-0 size-chrono" title="coral accent wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Matthieu_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen color ideas" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Modern design, combined with a stark palette, runs the risk of making your space feel a little cold. The owners of this <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/modern-kitchen-tile-backsplash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton Hill kitchen</a> incorporated a coral accent wall to inject plenty of warmth. Painting a single wall is a simple way to infuse personality, and if you ever get tired of the shade, you can easily change it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28402 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue walls in a galley kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen color ideas" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tile isn&#8217;t the only option when it comes to bringing color to your backsplash. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/manhattan-kitchen-remodel-turns-true-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rashmi</a> chose a peacock-blue semi-gloss paint for the walls of her kitchen, a choice that makes wiping them down a piece of cake. Plus, the cool hue contrasts beautifully with her warm, gold-toned cabinet hardware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20253 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bright blue lower cabinets paired with white upper cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen color ideas" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re feeling bold, colorful cabinets are the way to go. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikki and Chris</a> selected a brilliant shade of blue for their lower cabinets, balancing the bold choice with white upper cabinets. The approach feels stylish and chic without becoming overwhelming. Brushed brass hardware and a champagne-gold faucet are the perfect complements to the jewel-tone hue.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28089 mb-0 size-chrono" title="a riot of colorful cabinets and accent walls" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen color ideas" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re not afraid of color, go big! A well-balanced palette, like this combo of Benjamin Moore&#8217;s Juniper and Citron, paired with Farrow &amp; Ball&#8217;s Light Blue for the cabinets, is just the right amount of light and dark, bright and subdued. Nearby white walls and wood floors anchor the vibrant colors, elevating them to contemporary flair in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brooklyn-interior-design-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Donna&#8217;s</a> kitchen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tiled niches and marble shelves&#8230;pretty and practical</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the minimal approach of floor-to-ceiling tile in the shower surround can be beautiful, where does one keep the shampoo? If the answer is the lip of your tub, adding a few shelves or niches in the shower can be a game-changer. Below, five homeowners who worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, mix storage and organization with style.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29227 size-chrono" title="penny tile shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29228 mb-0 size-chrono" title="penny tile shower niches" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/penny-tile-beige-bath-blue-beauty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rachel and Michael</a> designed a backdrop of penny tile in a multitude of blue hues for their shower, extending the tile to nearby niches. The mosaic, clearly visible behind the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glass door</a>, is now the couple&#8217;s favorite part of the bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29229 size-chrono" title="marble shower surround" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-07-723x1087.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="723" height="1087" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29230 mb-0 size-chrono" title="marble tile corner shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-10-723x1090.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="723" height="1090" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marble corner shelves were cut from the leftover tile for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/holly-kitchen-bath-renovation-greenwich-village/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holly and Christian’s</a> space, an idea that scores points for ingenuity and thriftiness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, I got to live vicariously through a delightful homeowner&#8217;s Upper West Side kitchen transformation. Hafeeza and her husband made the big move from a 4,500 square foot home in suburban New Jersey to Manhattan&#8217;s Upper West Side in 2013. After raising five children, Hafeeza and her husband were ready for a retirement relocation that would put the City at their feet and free them from maintaining a large home. They spent a year in a temporary spot before finding the long-term city apartment where they planned to enjoy the essentials: family and friend get-togethers and nightly meals prepared by Hafeeza&#8217;s husband, the devoted family chef. The new space was ideal for those plans, except for the kitchen, which was functional but outdated and lacked the storage and prep space they envisioned. After talking to a number of contractors who weren&#8217;t available for or interested in the scope of the job, Hafeeza took to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to find a contractor for her list of simple and smart upgrades.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/kitchens/upper-west-side-kitchen-and-bathroom-renovation"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11635 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath-00.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath-00.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath-00-585x390.png 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath-00-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Our Sweeten Expert was a true professional from the initial meeting until the final payment.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Hafeeza M., Upper West Side homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Usually, when I talk to homeowners about their renovations, I get a dose of renovation envy: I want THAT sparkling new kitchen, too! But after talking with Hafeeza, I ended up with something extra and unexpected: a renewed appreciation for New York City living and the William Morris mantra we recently explored on the Sweeten blog. One look at <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1962" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hafeeza&#8217;s Sweeten project post</a> and you can see why. Hafeeza started with a call for<span id="more-11633"></span> a no-frills kitchen upgrade to minimize clutter and simplify the space. Her ideas for big and small upgrades were straightforward and to-the-point, with a few unusual details to tailor the kitchen to her lifestyle and her new city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen is enclosed and compact, so Hafeeza planned to add new cabinets, countertops, and appliances, and initially explored removing part of the wall to create a more open feel. The couple also wanted to relocate a closet, coat the entire apartment in fresh paint, and rig the kitchen for a fridge with an ice machine. If I had to name the worldly desires of most New Yorkers, more kitchen space, new paint, and an ice machine might well top the list. However, one request stopped me in my tracks. Hafeeza and her husband wanted to remove the dishwasher. Exclamation points!!! Hafeeza laughed when I helpfully explained to her that a dishwasher is kind of an integral part of a kitchen renovation, if not the holy grail for many new homeowners. She and her husband were certain that they valued more drawer space over the gadget and were happy to pitch in on the dishwashing together. Well. That is a new and interesting dishwashing philosophy!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11673 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_02.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_02.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_02-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11677 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_06.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="901" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_06.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_06-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We matched Hafeeza with Sweeten Expert Pedro who delivered big time with a flawless and angst-free kitchen renovation, first creating clean lines and a unified feel for the cabinets with a plywood base for the upper set, finished in acrylic laminate. The lower set of cabinets and drawers feature acrylic laminate over engineered wood. The glossy finish makes these cabinets easy to keep clean and will guard against dings and wear over time. To create more counter space without changing the room&#8217;s dimensions, Hafeeza relocated the sink from the middle of the counter to the home of the former dishwasher, leveraging plumbing already in place, opening up a more continuous counter prep area, and installing an extra-deep sink basin. Hafeeza chose a stainless steel Blomberg fridge and her husband selected a compact <a href="https://us.bertazzoni.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bertazzoni range</a>. They finished the look with Silestone quartz counters, a neutral and luminous glass tile backsplash, and porcelain floor tiles with a faux wood finish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11674 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_03.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_03.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_03-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11678" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_07.png" alt="SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_07" width="600" height="915" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_07.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_07-197x300.png 197w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, Hafeeza and her husband decided to leave the existing kitchen wall in place. Trying to open it would have added only 18 inches to the galley kitchen. Altering the plumbing to get a fridge with an ice machine also turned out to be overly expensive and unnecessary, so they skipped that detail as well. As they adjusted their plans to get the most out of the work, Hafeeza&#8217;s husband mentioned to Pedro that they had some minor upgrades in mind down the road for the bathroom. With a few quick calculations on the back of a napkin, Pedro and the couple realized they could make room in the budget for re-tiling and new fixtures. Hafeeza found the bulk of the new fixtures at <a href="https://www.decorplanet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decor Planet</a> in Manhattan and outfitted the bathroom with an energy efficient dual-flush toilet from <a href="https://www.frescabath.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fresca</a>, a full-wall medicine cabinet with mirrors inside and out, and a new vanity with storage drawers topped by a vessel sink. With extra storage, new lighting, and an upgraded shower head, Hafeeza and her husband were thrilled to find that they could re-vamp the bathroom within their budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11675 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_04.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_04.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_04-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11679 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_08.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="919" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_08.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_08-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After less than a month of work, Hafeeza and her husband moved into their new home to enjoy more than they had bargained for: the new kitchen, fresh paint throughout the apartment, gleaming bathroom finishes, and a space that let them stay focused on family, friends, and their vibrant new neighborhood. I tried (like three times!) to get Hafeeza to pick her favorite part of the new space but she wouldn&#8217;t budge. &#8220;The whole apartment! We&#8217;re just thrilled! We have New York City at our doorstep. What more do you need?!&#8221; Truly, I have been repeating that mantra to myself for the last week. Thank you, Hafeeza, for sharing your space and your unflappable urban dweller attitude with me!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna moved into their two-bedroom home &#8212; a former kindergarten classroom in a converted South Slope / Greenwood Heights Catholic school &#8212; four years ago. High ceilings, check. Big windows, check. Modern urban oasis, check. Erica, who works for the City of New York, and Donna, a digital product consultant, were initially drawn to industrial and rustic decor as a way to balance and warm up the contemporary feel of their new space. But, after overspending on a pricey couch and accenting the windows and doors with a red paint that grew to irritate them both, the couple decided they needed design help. After they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a>, we introduced them to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/814" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten designer</a> to help bring new life to this old-school space.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="small-bedroom-with-hardwood-before-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47989 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3.jpg" alt="small bedroom with hardwood floor before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="bedroom-with-teal-accent-wall" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47984 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2.jpg" alt="small bedroom with teal accent wall and wall lights and hardwood floors and windows after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Our designer had a lot of creative ideas. Some of the areas of our apartment that she transformed were not even on our radar design-wise until she pointed them out.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Erica W., Brooklyn Homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna focused first on their bedroom. They wanted tranquility, comfort, and a little romance; they also needed to maximize the long, narrow layout of the room and find art to make the space feel personal and vibrant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The designer sought to create a relaxed retreat, in tune with the couple&#8217;s design preferences. She put together an inspiration booklet to illustrate creative concepts, drawings, and to simply nail the creative vision. The trio took group shopping trips and worked together to upgrade the shabby-schoolhouse-chic vibe with cleaner lines, bolder colors, and improved. Their designer led the way with an accent wall in Benjamin Moore Venezuelan Sea, offset by the existing gray on the remaining walls. Two smart tricks here: first, the accent wall appears to wash onto the overdyed rug, lengthening <wbr />the space in a way that makes the furniture selections look custom and built-in, and second, the accent wall provides an immediate visual shift, just by painting a single wall.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna love the gray tufted Cisco Brothers bed &#8211; it anchors the room and offers geometric depth to the monochromatic bedding (full disclosure: I am <a href="https://sweeten.com/team/apartment-renovation-east-village/">partial to gray tufted upholstery</a>!). The designer found a gorgeous and super-functional armed lighting fixture on <a href="https://classifieds.apartmenttherapy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apartment Therapy Classifieds</a> to feature above the bed &#8211; a hat tip to Erica and Donna&#8217;s fondness for industrial pieces but with a decidedly glam finish. Mounting the lighting fixture on the wall above the bed freed up space on each bedside table, crucial in a room with just eight feet in width to spare. If you look closely, you can catch a side glimpse of Marilyn Monroe swimming in the photo on the left wall. Erica especially loves this piece and the shot of red and green it offers up to complement other accents in the room.</p>
<h2>&#8220;I sought to create a refreshingly relaxed retreat. The solution was to carry varying hues of blue and green heavily-pigmented accent walls &#8211; the colors of the sea &#8211; throughout the space. Serene, but invigorating.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>&#8211; </em>Sweeten Designer</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the open living room, their designer set out to rehab the &#8220;expensive mistakes&#8221; that frustrated Erica and Donna. They focused on highly saturated paint colors and new, more comfortable furniture. The windows are such a central feature to the space; the designer restored their presence with Benjamin Moore Super White throughout the room and cleared away stuff that had accumulated on the unusually deep window sills. They also selected a central wall to saturate with yellow, anchoring the space. To further play up the industrial loft theme, a structural beam and elements of the sprinkler system were coated in a dark bronze.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna swapped out their dining set for Eames molded chairs. The dining table, already part of their collection, reflects the couple&#8217;s love for reclaimed materials, but looks updated with the clean lines of the new chairs. The Milo Baughman coffee table is simple and uncluttered; the Saarinen side table plays up the clean and modern furniture touches &#8211; both were savvy finds on eBay.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Toward the kitchen, visitors get their first glimpse of an accent wall coated in Benjamin Moore Juniper. As a standalone feature, it&#8217;s a fun addition to the yellow and white throughout the room. But, it also serves as a sneak peak into the new bedroom and ties the spaces together visually. Erica and Donna revived the old kitchen cabinets, originally finished with a faux cherry wood stain, by painting them with Farrow &amp; Ball&#8217;s Light Blue. I love this color &#8211; it is equal parts vintage and modern, simple but playful.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Behind the kitchen, Erica and Donna invested in creating a new closet space to help them keep stuff organized and out of sight. Working from the design, this Sweeten contractor built shelving and enclosed the closet with sliding doors and simple hardware.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="hallway-with-closets-hardwood-floors" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47990 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-5.jpg" alt="hallway with hardwood floors and closets and white walls after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The last six months have brought big-time changes for Blaise, Kristin, and their family of five. After welcoming their third child and moving from Manhattan to Brooklyn, Blaise and Kristin were ready to prep their new home in Prospect Lefferts Gardens for the long run. First up: a kitchen and laundry room update. We stopped in to take some photos along the way, but the rest of this story is told by Blaise, himself.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brooklyn-kitchen-and-laundry-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11124 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_BlaiseKitchen-cover.png" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_BlaiseKitchen-cover.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_BlaiseKitchen-cover-300x200.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_BlaiseKitchen-cover-585x390.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h3>&#8220;Sweeten made it easy to communicate our vision to contractors before they even set foot in our home.&#8221;</h3>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Blaise C., Prospect Lefferts Gardens homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we moved into our new home six months ago, we almost didn&#8217;t notice how limited the kitchen was. Living out of boxes and welcoming a newborn, it took us a few weeks to realize that we were having trouble finding space for groceries and that we had accidentally made a habit of storing kitchen basics in the basement. The move just about doubled the total space of our home, and yet we were struggling to find a place for everyday kitchen stuff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our punch list was pretty classic: kitchen storage was sorely lacking and countertop space was a joke. We are working parents who don&#8217;t cook that often, but we were ready to move our pots and pans out of the oven. We also realized that the bar-height counter was inaccessible for our kids and wanted to create a central gathering spot with a more standard counter height.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11126 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-01.png" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-01.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-01-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11127 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-03.png" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-03.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-03-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen had been recently renovated and we liked the look, so we initially entertained the possibility of a quick fix like purchasing a kitchen island, but ended up deciding to use what we had and expand on it. At first, I tried to juggle contractor bids on my own, but with kids and jobs, that turned out to be decidedly easier said than done. I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1197" target="_blank">posted the project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank">Sweeten</a> and added to the plans to create a laundry room in the basement by enclosing our washer/dryer with built-out walls and solid doors.<span id="more-11119"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11128 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-02.png" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-02.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-02-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten introduced us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2536" target="_blank">this Sweeten contractor</a> (of recent <a href="https://sweeten.com/team/apartment-renovation-east-village/" target="_blank">Sweeten blog fame!</a>) and we awarded our project to him after seeing his straightforward and realistic style. My biggest fear was that a contractor would say yes to anything to seal the deal, but he gave us a realistic completion date and it was nice to know from the start that his team had already been screened by Sweeten.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11129 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/during-01.png" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/during-01.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/during-01-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11130 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/during-02.png" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/during-02.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/during-02-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our contractor guided the work through multiple stages and helped us seamlessly extend our existing kitchen cabinetry with custom drawers, stained and finished to match the look we already had. When we had trouble coming up with matching backsplash tile, he managed to track it down with a local builder. We were also grateful for his willingness to work around our family&#8217;s schedule &#8211; naturally, we picked New York&#8217;s most brutal winter to live through a kitchen renovation and relied on Paul to gracefully adjust on snow days when the kids were home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After watching our contractor put the new cabinetry pieces in place and create a dedicated laundry room, we found a few other spots for his team to add finishing touches and details including cosmetic wall patching and custom doors to replace a tired set that concealed the fuse boxes for the property.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11134 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_06.jpg" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="397" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_06-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11135 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_07.jpg" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="397" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_07-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are thrilled with the results and psyched that we were able to work with so much of what we already had. Instead of cutting into our living space, the new drawers and extended counters have preserved our open kitchen and put everything within reach. The new laundry room helps us stay organized and minimizes the sound of the machines so that we can enjoy the play space with our kids. Even my mother-in-law was impressed, an unforeseen but welcome benefit of the hard work!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11131 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_02.jpg" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="397" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_02-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11133 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_01.jpg" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="906" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_01-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Bravo to Blaise and his gang for a great team effort! A smart kitchen extension and a real laundry room are a huge win for any NYC family. We&#8217;re always glad when we can impress extended family members; we just hope the pans and the oven are adjusting to their newly-longer-distance relationship!</em></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Renovations can be painful. Sweeten takes the hassle and guesswork out of the process. Overall it was a very pleasant experience and we are thrilled with the end product.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">-Ben C., Brooklyn Heights homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What do you do when you realize that your bathroom is just not working for you anymore? Ben &amp; Therese&#8217;s Brooklyn Heights bathroom wasn&#8217;t even 10 years old before they recognized that the space was ugly, outdated, and felt cramped &#8212; even little Enzo (pictured above) didn&#8217;t want to bathe in what he regarded as a cheap, generic tub &#8212; it was time for an update.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple took a savvy approach, collecting enough inspiration and research online that, together, they were ultimately able to design the bathroom of their dreams and a space that would reflect their personal tastes. They even built a 3D model of their ideas using Google SketchUp to help them plan and visualize the space; according to Ben, &#8220;we didn’t want to leave anything to chance, and we wanted to make sure we utilized every square inch as best we could.&#8221; With their very real vision, Ben &amp; Therese were more than ready to renovate, so <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project on Sweeten</a> to be matched with a vetted general contractor who would help them finish the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10793" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_02.png" alt="brooklyn-heights-bathroom-renovation" width="475" height="462" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_02.png 594w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_02-300x292.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ben &amp; Therese moved forward with their first match who was just the right fit for the project, and in just 4 weeks, Sweeten Expert Aleks and his team were able transform the generic bath into the homeowners&#8217; inspired vision. Here&#8217;s their space before &amp; after:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10794 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03.png" alt="brooklyn-heights-bathroom-renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10795 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_04.png" alt="brooklyn-heights-bathroom-renovation" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_04.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_04-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple took a universal ideal of clean, simple and modern, but made a space that is uniquely theirs by incorporating industrial elements like cement tile &amp; shower doors on sliding hardware, and adding a splash of color with Moroccan-inspired flooring tiles. Ben even says that it feels bigger and more open after renovating (a big plus in BK), not to mention that it&#8217;s much more functional. I love it, they love it, their friends love it, and little Enzo couldn&#8217;t be happier &#8212; sounds like a win!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great work to Aleks &amp; his team &#8212; and big congrats and many thanks to Ben, Therese &amp; Enzo!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Around the end of last year, Elliot, a Graphic Designer, and Katie, a Benefit Specialist, decided that the time had come to take the scary but sensible plunge and become first-time homeowners of an older 1,800 sq/ft, 2-story townhouse in Williamsburg. The couple fell in love with this house&#8217;s lovely bones, plus it had a backyard for their dog, Desmond; but what they did not love was that it had the common NYC problem of disjointed spaces caused by a layout of many smaller rooms, not to mention the interior&#8217;s outdated <em><span style="color: #000000;">everything</span></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the couple had never done a renovation before, they were excited by the idea of fixing up an older home. So the next task was to find their general contractor, which wouldn&#8217;t be easy (they thought) since they didn&#8217;t know many other homeowners, and therefore word-of-mouth was out of the question. After hearing about our resources at Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katie &amp; Elliot posted their project</a> right away to get matched with members of the Sweeten Network. After comparing their matches, the young homeowners chose to put their project in the trustworthy hands of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten general contractor</a> focused on sustainable design-building. The contractor worked with the renovation newbies to think through everything from the practicality of materials to overall design concepts, before beginning construction on their 4-month project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10650 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10651 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10652 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Katie &amp; Elliot&#8217;s first order of business was to re-do the kitchen so that they could finally enjoy eating-in, as much as they do dining out at their favorite neighborhood spot. Ecostruct enlarged the space by opening up existing entranceways and creating larger floor-to-ceiling cabinet systems. During demolition, Ecostruct&#8217;s team, lead by Jon Eklund, found that the existing plumbing needed to be replaced because it was not up to code (and was actually a ticking time bomb inside their walls). This added some extra time, expenses, and maybe a few gray hairs to the project, but both the homeowners and Jon&#8217;s team were confident that it was a problem worth solving right away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10653 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10654 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10655 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luckily, Elliot and Katie have similar taste when it comes to interiors. The couple wanted to create a home that had a warm, clean and modern feel with plenty of light. For the kitchen, they choose to use both recessed lighting and Caravaggio Matte Grey Pendant Lights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10656 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jon helped Elliot and Katie think about the new materials in terms of cost, aesthetics and sustainability &#8211; triple bonus! The couple picked Caesarstone in White Farina for their countertops which is known not just for its simplified fabrication and installation process that makes it budget-friendly, but also for its nonporous and scratch resistant qualities which will help it retain a perfect surface without sealants or waxes, keeping harmful toxins out of the home. For the floors, the couple went with Mirage Knotty Walnut floors throughout the living room, open kitchen and dining room. The wood adds nice warmth to the space and its natural irregularities make a nice contrast with the white clean lines of their kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10657 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10658 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether it was the mix of mid-90’s earth toned floor-to-ceiling tiles, black accented toilet seat, or the fact that the faulty old pipes in the walls were about to bust open, updating this bathroom was a must. I loved how, by continuing with the same color palette and general clean aesthetic of the adjacent kitchen, the bathroom  now reads as an integrated part of the home and less of a time warp.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10659 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/09_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/09_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/09_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The living room is tied both aesthetically and visually by opening up the island and updating the dry bar so the ever so hospitable Katie or Elliot can do what they do best, serve their lucky guests a cocktail while cooking up a meal in the kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10666 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the entry foyer, the homeowners had Jon&#8217;s team replace the front door and repaint the concrete flooring and wood staircase; they also hung a nice big <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/park-slope-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mirror that looks pretty familiar</a>. I really like the shabby-chic but very gender-neutral vibe of the foyer, which I&#8217;m sure is making many great first impressions for the Katie and Elliot&#8217;s visiting friends and family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks and congrats to Katie and Elliot! And a big thanks to Jon and his team at Ecostruct!</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Here at Sweeten, we understand that pairing the correct architect and client is more than circumstantial, and that the best working relationships are based largely on shared visions and philosophies. This <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/portfolios/448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chelsea gut renovation</a> project brought together Sweeten member firm Future Project, co-owned by Pedro Pachano and Ampara Vollert, who specialize in exploring theories of space and sensory discovery in their architecture, with an art collector client who wanted more than just a space to showcase her individual art pieces. The art-loving homeowner was looking for something that would act as a flexible framework for her entire collection and lifestyle.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The apartment&#8217;s original layout was made up of a number of smaller rooms that varied in floor height, which did not allow for two key aspects that the homeowner specified for her remodeled home: to be able to entertain large numbers of people, and to have significant wall space for her collected works.<span id="more-10514"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10516" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg" alt="01_living" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">By removing a series of interior walls, integrating a diffused lighting system that creates flattering light for the homeowner&#8217;s many dinner parties, and using wide plank, white washed maple flooring and continuous, white walls and surface planes, the renovated apartment can now be experienced as an expansive space that is punctuated with art and views of the city.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10517" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg" alt="02_kitchen-entrance" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, Pedro and Ampara created a similarly expansive yet more personalized experience by using materials that engage both the senses of vision and touch. Here, custom, white Corian cabinets create uniform planes which are even used to hide the appliances, and a nice plus is that the Corian panels are pleasant to the touch. Knowing the homeowner&#8217;s propensity to entertain, the Future Project team designed a custom cantilevered island. The island is topped with an ocean blue resin surface like the countertop and backsplash which creates visual depth in the space and “relaxes the eye.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10518" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg" alt="03_family" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10519" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg" alt="04_family-2" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Discovery&#8221; was a theme Future Project worked with in their design, and we love how they used this idea here in the den area with this unique paneled wall system. The polished Rosewood veneer panels open to reveal a series of interior spaces, each with its own color of polished lacquer paint and unique function. One door leads to a guest bathroom, another to a roll-out closet system, and the one above opens to a colorful custom bar installation by a contemporary artist.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10536" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg" alt="bath" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;s a peek into the guest bath, one of our favorite rooms in the apartment. This space features a custom vanity and shower construction made of grey Corian with mirrored edges which make for a unique, fragmented optical illusion.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10520" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg" alt="05_master-bath" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The master bathroom is equally blue and oceanic. The walls, floor and ceiling here are tiled in 1&#8243; <a href="https://www.glasstile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oceanside Tessera glass mosaic tiles</a>, and the vanity is custom in white Thassos marble.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10521" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg" alt="06_bedroom" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Because she entertains so frequently, the homeowner wanted the option of a guest room, but at the same time did not want to give up her home&#8217;s open, gallery-like quality. Pedro and Ampara came up with a smart solution to accommodate both needs with a custom sliding wall (for separation) and second bed that&#8217;s all stored beneath the master bed.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10522" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png" alt="08_double-wine-hallway" width="600" height="428" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">As if we needed any further proof, this homeowner&#8217;s wine closet is yet another testament to her hostessing skills &#8212; so, when&#8217;s the next party?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Great work and many thanks to Future Project&#8217;s Pedro and Ampara for sharing their work with us; we look forward to seeing more from these designers, soon!</p>
