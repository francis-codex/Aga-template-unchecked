										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tile revamps ho-hum walls and floors in an instant—from tile flooring to backsplash tile.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22453 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg" alt="Geometric tile backsplash" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Geometric tile backsplash in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet&#8217;s Crown Heights kitchen</a><span class="img-label"> .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are, your home has tiles somewhere—the bathroom and kitchen, or maybe a foyer or mudroom. While they serve a practical purpose—waterproof, easy to clean, protects surfaces—tiles have now emerged as a pivotal element in taking a space from flat to fabulous! Look to tile as a style and even a fashion choice, as manufacturing advances such as high-definition (HD) printing and slip-resistant finishes help to create a personal statement on floors, as well as walls. Consider these five trends:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Faux effects</h3>
<p>Improvements in HD printing have translated to tile with highly realistic interpretations of natural materials like wood and stone, as well as concrete, plaster, and metal. And the options don’t stop there. In addition to the oak or walnut look, these woods are coupled with different finishes and treatments—pickled, distressed, reclaimed (with the faux paint still intact), sustainable alternatives to exotic hardwoods like a mirror-polished cherry or mahogany that you might previously have found only in a palace or a yacht. This tile also lets you take “wood” where you previously might not have&#8230;inside a shower, for instance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for stone, you can install a luxurious-looking faux marble for your entire bath at a tenth the cost of the real thing, and without the habitual upkeep, such as sealing. No need to worry about scratches or water or wine stains with glazed porcelain. Why not combine a faux-wood and a faux-stone look in a bath? Most tile comes 3/8-inch thick, so it’s easier to combine these looks in tile than to align the differing heights of real wood planks with marble slabs on a floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a more industrial look for, say, a loft or home office, check out faux concrete in a super-size, like 24” x 24”—again, without the need to seal and with no risk of cracking, like poured concrete. If you crave color but don’t want those glossy 4” x 4” squares you remember from the school washroom, look for porcelain tiles that mimic encaustic cement tiles, with their luscious hues and patterns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Add various textures</h3>
<p>As described above, faux effects are achieved from highly realistic HD printing. Textures are also now being incorporated during the manufacturing process. Some faux weathered wood porcelain tile includes the dings and saw marks you’d expect to find in reclaimed planks, minus the splinters!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brick is making a comeback too, and with the introduction of faux brick tile comes a realistic pebbled surface. Consider paving your entryway with this tactile material—a perfect crossover from the outside in. Colored glazes in myriad choices give this brick fresh, contemporary appeal, and can provide a touch of texture to a space where a neutral color dominates like a shower or backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also expect to find tile with finishes that resemble fabric, from nubby linen to lace to fine twill. These styles look especially warm underfoot, and bring sophisticated depth when used on walls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Consider three-dimensional</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, 3D tile was very popular in those cool mid-century houses that were never renovated. If it was ever on your wishlist, you likely had to pay a lot for something that was hand cast or, alternatively, rough around the edges (literally). However, the demand for 3D has risen among designers for hotels and restaurants, and homeowners are now reaping the results. Manufacturers offer lots of interesting sculptural surfaces, from shallow recesses that resemble waves or indentations worn into stone by water to alternating raised and recessed hexagons to abstract and organic shapes that seem to spring from their surfaces. These tiles are good for feature walls and vertical areas, such as hallways that transition from one room to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Beyond basic shapes and patterns</h3>
<p>The hexagon is one of the more popular shapes to appear in kitchens and baths; it combines graphic interest with a classic outline, providing a strong motif around which you can play with size and color. One manufacturer created a wall tile with alternating rising and recessed discs. The 3” x 6” subway tile is seeing a renaissance, and reinterpreted in a thinner and longer dimension like 2” x 10” or even 2” x 20”. The rectilinear shapes lend themselves to a lot of different patterns when installed, like herringbone, chevron, and the running bond as an alternative to the traditional stacked. If you’re in the market for something more sensual, consider an arabesque-shape tile. Smaller versions will work on the floor, where the grout lines prevent slipping; it also makes a pretty backsplash or wall behind a vanity in a master bath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Choose your size</h3>
<p>If you’ve visited a tile store lately, you’ve probably noticed tiles are getting, well, bigger. Rectangular shapes can be found twice as wide as you may be accustomed to, such as 12” x 24”. Squares, too, have doubled in size, from 12” x 12” to 24” x 24”. Besides their fashion-forward appearance, there are several additional benefits: these larger sizes or formats actually make a small space, such as a bath, appear larger. There’s also fewer grout lines, which means faster installation and easier upkeep. However, the size trend doesn’t stop there. Designers are mixing sizes to create interesting effects, and you can, too. Combine wide and narrow wood planks, for instance, to achieve a custom effect, or alternate four small squares with one large square in the same size.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>A word about grout</h3>
<p>A decade or so ago, most tile installations used a white or off-white grout. It was adequate to blend into the tile’s appearance and still show the pattern. Now you can choose from dozens of colors to match your selection. Contrasting grout, however, has caught on, particularly with subway and other rectangular formats, to get a more graphic effect or to emphasize the shape of the tile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8212;<br />
Your choice in tile can influence the entire space it occupies. Here is how <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arthur and Kate</a> used stacked patterns in minimalist fashion, while <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kellys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-sweeten-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kelly</a> went bold with cement tile on the floor but subtly glamorous on the wall. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet’s</a> geometric backsplash become the kitchen’s centerpiece, while <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua’s</a> subtle 3D tile struck a perfect balance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">For Frans, a real estate broker, and his wife, Dalal, downsizing from a 2,500 square foot Flatiron District loft to a one-bathroom studio in neighboring Gramercy Park raised only one challenge: Where to put the mudroom! Size was hardly an issue for this unflappable couple, who set out to fit a few custom features into a much lower-maintenance space and came to Sweeten for a general contractor who could bring the vision together. Read on to see how they made room for a mudroom, master closets, and sleeping space for four in this mighty studio!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20138 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-25-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><span id="more-18627"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal were happy to leave behind extra square footage but wanted to bring a few specific features to their new home: A mudroom, to ward off sooty and sometimes snowy layers from city streets, wardrobe closets organized for two, and modern electrical wiring that would support an integrated system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They’d decided on this particular studio apartment because it offered a smaller but markedly similar version of the living room in their loft, and because eventually they planned to relocate to Long Island. So, a revamp would make this home convenient and comfortable until their next adventure, and put everything in place for a future crash pad. Frans enlisted a<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>to achieve the loft-like space they had in mind, while personalizing a number of key features throughout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main studio space was a standard boxy room that backed up to one wall of windows and existing decor was mostly dark and decades old. Because of the single source of light, it took some imagination to carve up the room for use in different ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal designated the windowed area as their new living room, and aimed to update and expand the kitchen, bathroom, and wardrobes while incorporating an urban mudroom into a large hall closet. They also wanted to replace all of the dated finishes throughout the apartment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18630 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" alt="sweeten_frans_apartment-before-03" width="600" height="796" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-03-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18628 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" alt="sweeten_frans_apartment-before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18629" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_frans_apartment-before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting with the dark parquet floors, their contractor and his team made way for 7-inch white oak planks from Siberian Wood Flooring, and installed them throughout the home, even replacing the kitchen’s old linoleum black and white floors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original 6 x 8-foot kitchen nook offered very little workspace surrounded by drab brown decor. Directly across from the nook was an oversized closet, which Frans hoped to incorporate into a new, larger kitchen design. The team took on major demolition to create a larger footprint and a workable U-shape, allowing for openness and access. They designed and built custom kitchen cabinetry, finished in putty-gray paint for the bottom cabinets, and white with glass panels for the upper line with seamless metal hardware. A number of cool custom features for specific storage needs are sprinkled throughout, and walnut shelving over the new under-mount sink helps extend the kitchen&#8217;s depth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">White linoleum counters were tossed and replaced with natural white Bianco Brazilian marble with gray veining. Frans and Dalal chose a matte white glass subway-style tile for the backsplash, which now runs up the length of the wall by the new island, where two dining seats, plenty of additional counter space, and black pendant lighting are in easy reach. Top-grade stainless steel appliances replaced the tiny outdated white units, and a large professional-grade hood was fashioned over the 30-inch Bertazzoni gas oven range.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the old closet, their contractor turned part of that into the mudroom Frans and Dalal were after, complete with custom shelving and various storage needs. And as an extension for the new kitchen, white custom cabinetry conceals the refrigerator and houses an exposed wet bar and wine fridge.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal worked with Kris to create two customized and flexible sleeping spaces. Kris built sliding accordion doors out of walnut wood and opaque resin that stack together out of the way when opened, or become solid partition walls when extended and closed off.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom section, Kris built a king-sized platform bed and matching nightstands. In the living room, the team devised a plan for a customized built-in wall unit, incorporating a queen-sized murphy bed and guest closet all conveniently and seamlessly hidden behind white lacquered plywood. Across the room from this addition, Kris installed a single walnut shelf running alongside the wall and just off the floor to corral entertainment equipment and living room knick-knacks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Frans and Dalal had a few simple ideas in mind. Plain white tiles, dim lighting, and very old superficial hardware had outworn their welcome. The couple planned to get rid of all the existing dated decor, change the footprint to allow for a larger, more accessible layout, and customize the adjoining closet to cater to “his and her” needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kris tore everything out and rotated the footprint by 90 degrees to swap the shower and vanity, allowing for greater use of space overall. Old floor tiles were ripped out and light gray ceramic tiles, mimicking that of stone, went down in their place. Upon entering the bathroom directly off the bedroom, you’ll find an oversized white porcelain sink nestled into a new walnut wood vanity built entirely by Kris, finished with ultra modern red and silver metal hardware. To the left of the vanity stands a new glass shower, bedecked with skateboard street-art-style wall tiles for a very artistic, creatively modern, and very hip “New York” aesthetic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new wardrobe situation is impressive. A walk-in closet was already in place, but the couple had a better plan to build a more streamlined and highly organized pass-through closet. Using the door to the old closet, Kris custom built movable shelving units out of corresponding walnut wood for shoes and other sections for hanging clothes. These movable units lead to a separate bathroom entry to the back of the studio, where the living room sits. The homeowners also gained a new compact washer/dryer to complete the turn-around.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Not one to miss the tiniest of details, Frans had the entire apartment wired for temperature, lighting, and sound control he conveniently accesses via phone. Frans and Dalal not only got the mudroom, but also managed to fold in multiple, flexible spaces to this origami apartment. Their new “studio” might be the only one in all of Manhattan with as many separate rooms as they now have, perfectly positioned within one unique space.</p>
