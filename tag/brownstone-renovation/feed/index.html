<h3>A growing family motivates a new domicile</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Danielle Brooks has made a career in a bright orange jumpsuit as Taystee on Netflix’s hit show <em>Orange is the New Black</em>. But don’t take that to mean she doesn’t have style. The actor is known for her </span><span class="s2">sense of glamour, a love of color, and her embrace of her cultural heritage.</span><span class="s1"> It would be a strong influence on the </span><span class="s3">2,000-square-foot Brooklyn brownstone she purchased.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The four-bedroom, four-bathroom home was a clean slate—a designer’s dream. The house had a lot of great touches, but they were the work of the developer. Danielle planned to move into the house with her family and wanted to make it their own. </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">To renovate the sleek five-floor brownstone, she turned to African-American interior designers, known for embracing culture and design. Jeanine Hays and Bryan Mason of <a href="https://www.aphrochic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AphroChic</a> would bring a modern, soulful interior to the project. The designers collaborated with <span class="s4">Sweeten and hired a general contracting team who understood how to execute their aesthetic. The contractors had also been featured as a Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/support-black-owned-general-contractor-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black-owned contracting firm</a> and as a <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woman-owned contracting firm</a>.</span></span></p>

<h3>A homeowner&#8217;s first home purchase</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Jeanine</span> explained, “To start the design process, we came to Sweeten in our quest to identify the right contractor.” T</span><span class="s1">he designers were matched with a choice of experts and received bids. They chose their general contractor, who set out to give the space a face-lift that would elevate the home’s character. </span><span class="s1">“Through the renovation,” <span class="s3">Jeanine</span> said, “we were able to give each room in the home a warm and evocative color palette. The beautiful metallic lighting perfectly suits Danielle and her own eye-catching aesthetic.” </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41825 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-06.jpg" alt="living room" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-06.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s5">For Danielle, who moved from a rental apartment to the multi-story house, the new place was a dream come true. </span><span class="s1">“Getting to buy my first home has been a joy and such an accomplishment,” she recently told <em>People</em> magazine, adding that she had long hoped to be a homeowner by the time she turned 30. </span><span class="s5">This was the actor’s first experience with renovating, and she couldn’t wait to turn the </span><span class="s1">brownstone into a true home for herself, her partner, and her soon-to-be-born little one.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s3">African-American interior designers find inspiration</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The AphroChic principals honed in on what inspired Danielle. “They asked me, ‘What does your house sound like?&#8217;” Danielle told <em>People</em>. After much discussion, the trio arrived at a “jazzy Ella [Fitzgerald] meets Jay-Z meets Bob Marley-type feel,” Danielle said. This sound, the designer said, was an ideal fit for the actor, who is also a Tony Award-nominated vocalist.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41830 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-11.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-11.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-11-1536x1024.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The resulting plan focused on creating a warm, family-friendly environment. It would include a variety of hues and saturation and a lot of patterns. Art conveyed images of African-American heritage and Black beauty. They decided first up to lavish the house’s interior with an artisan label specializing in low VOC paint. Lighting selections included</span><span class="s1"> a gold-finished chandelier for the dining room and two cage-style pendants with an open geometric form above the kitchen island. Sconces from the designers’ own home lighting collection were chosen for the bedroom. </span></p>

<h4>A vision for open-concept living</h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The walls in the open-plan living and dining area are a sophisticated hue that looks blue in the daylight and turns to a soft gray at night. In the dining area, the cool shade allowed the warm finishes to shine, including the smoke-black and metallic dining table. Gray walls popped against the new-build kitchen, with hints of salmon and warm browns.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the home’s living area, the walls made an excellent backdrop for an array of colorful pieces. Here, forest green velvet sofas are flanked by a golden silk dupioni drapery. For an African touch, the designers brought in a table lamp from their collection that featured handmade details. </span><span class="s1">The room’s bright and bold color palette is mirrored in the Saint and Miss NoHo art pieces by Australian artist, Brent Rosenberg, whose work Danielle learned about through her designers.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41828 mb-0 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-09.jpg" alt="living room" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-09.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-09-1536x1024.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41822 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-03.jpg" alt="living room" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-03.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jeanine-Hays-Townhouse-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<h4>The color palette expands</h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Next up, the master bedroom. One of the elements the designers were most excited about was the decision to paint this room black. “It was something that Danielle was hesitant about at first,” <span class="s3">Jeanine</span> said, pointing out that, as designers, she and Bryan felt it was their job to introduce their client to new ways of making a visual impact in her home. “We got her to embrace the black bedroom,” <span class="s3">Jeanine</span> said, “and it’s one of our favorite spaces,” giving the room a luxe appeal and a sultry depth. </span></p>
<h3>An All-Black renovation team delivers</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The job went smoothly from start to finish. “We honestly didn’t face a lot of challenges with this project,” <span class="s3">Jeanine</span> said. &#8220;A big reason for that was having an excellent team. We had incredible communication with the Sweeten team; they were committed to the plan and worked hard to make things go smoothly.” The biggest challenge may have been choosing the exact height of the sconces for the bedroom, when the bed Danielle had chosen had not yet been delivered. Planning and attention to detail by the contractors took care of this issue without a problem, according to <span class="s3">Jeanine</span>. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For AphroChic, the home is a crowning achievement. It’s a rich and textured interior where the African Diaspora is celebrated through African-inspired prints and art. Handmade Moroccan light fixtures and artisan items from Danielle’s home state of South Carolina layer in personality. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Danielle agrees that her new place feels like home in so many ways. “We really wanted a space that felt communal,” the actor, who loves to cook and entertain, told <em>People</em>.</span><span class="s6"> With a bustling neighborhood outside her door, the house feels happy, full, and big on style.</span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Danielle, for sharing your home Sweeten home!</em></p>

In this blog post, we visit the couple in the second phase of the project. To recap: They’d purchased a historic brownstone with “good bones” on a quiet street in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. They were aware that the circa 1910 building was in need of a total interior gutting and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/29654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted contractors.</p>
<p>What they didn’t expect to learn was that the wooden beam that had brought essential stability to their brownstone for 100-plus years suffered from rot. They’d hired both a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect</a> and a Sweeten general contractor to drive the overhaul. Once the couple had installed the integral metal beam running through their long-sought brownstone, they were initiated. Moving walls, installing a kitchen, and replacing splintered floorboards were achievable tasks. They were pros.</p>

They would have, once finished, three units to rent as well as their own top-floor studio pied-a-terre, which they planned to use as a second home. A key goal was to preserve the building’s prewar details while streamlining and modernizing the interior spaces. They also wanted to create bigger, brighter apartments and therefore planned to convert the building’s traditional two-bedroom configurations to one-bedroom layouts. The project also included opening up the kitchens and enlarging the bathrooms. All applied to the ground-floor garden apartment.</p>

<p>The initial plan for the fireplace was to remove it—although the mirrors were original and in good shape, it&#8217;s doors were damaged and the pillars didn&#8217;t suit their aesthetic. Their architect suggested they &#8220;<span class="s1">repaint it and open it up to the brick in the bottom area, &#8220;Jerry said. &#8220;We really like how it turned out.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>They also preserved as much original wood flooring as possible which were stained and discolored, including the inlaid mahogany borders. &#8220;<span class="s1">We were surprised when both our Sweeten architect and contractor said that the living room floors were salvageable,&#8221; he said. The width of the boards was no longer made but &#8220;t</span><span class="s1">he contractor went out of his way to find a warehouse with a supply of vintage floorboards to fill in gaps and match to the existing flooring,&#8221; Jerry said. </span></p>

In this apartment, she and the architects decided to move things around, shifting the kitchen forward and the bath back. By reshuffling the spaces and putting the kitchen adjacent to the living room, they were able to create a kitchen island that floats on the edge of the living space. The quartz-topped island has counter seating, making it great for quick breakfasts and weekend gatherings; it incorporates an under-counter sink and is lit by a pair of modern pendant fixtures. The shiny stainless-steel hood and dishwasher are from IKEA, as is the gray cabinetry. “We really like the geometric tiles we chose for the kitchen backsplash,” Jerry said.  They add unique character and dimension to what is now a highly visible wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40747 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-20.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-20-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40757 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-14.gif" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />Putting the kitchen here opened up what had formerly been a hallway, lined with inset wall cabinets. The doors of these units had been painted a bright chartreuse green—not the couple’s color, but there was a character to them that they wanted to preserve. The contractor stripped the paint, resurfaced, and repainted the doors to look almost new. <span class="s1">&#8220;We are very happy with the restoration of the cabinets,&#8221; Jerry said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great feature for the apartment—it adds so much storage space.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Janet loves how the original doors, now bright white, add a historic touch and some concealed storage to the wall facing the kitchen. The contractor installed new shelving and additional drawers, too, to increase the cupboards’ sleek functionality.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/E1bZ07c4-A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40882 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-BrownstoneReno-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-BrownstoneReno-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-BrownstoneReno-1-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-BrownstoneReno-1-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Going for a more open layout really worked in other ways, too, with their old-new aesthetic. The revamped kitchen’s modern appliances are a great contrast to the fantastic old fireplace that is the living room’s most notable feature. They kept it, had the contractor replace the broken display door and window with a very close match, and repainted its mirrored mantel.</p>
<p>The kitchen’s relocation also did wonders for the bedroom, which is at the apartment’s rear. Having opened up the space, they expanded it further by eliminating the rear portion of the apartment’s narrow floor-through hallway and a tiny water closet next to the garden door. When all those walls came down, they had a large, sunny bedroom, flooded with light but completely private. There was room as well to build a large, sliding-door closet with built-in shelving.</p>

The fixtures and hardware, including the faucet and an open train-rack shelf, nod to the traditional. The couple stuck with the elongated shower tile they had chosen for the other rental units—like subway tiles, but stretched—and went with a large rain shower head to add modern luxury to the large stand-up shower. The hexagonal floor tiles are repeats from upstairs as well.</p>
<p>From the front door to back, the apartment came together beautifully, and Janet and Jerry have their Sweeten team to thank. Jerry recalls that the general contractor, who managed the timeline and the subcontractors from one phase into the next, did an excellent job communicating and keeping the project on schedule. “We found the company honest and responsible for the quality of all work,” he said. “At one point, when we felt like some of the workmanship was sub-par—some newly installed tiles in the bathroom were cracked—the contractor acknowledged our complaint and worked to fix the issue.”</p>

<p>Sweeten also matched them with an architect. Prior to tapping the service, they were about to hire an architect they found on a chat forum only to discover the architect had a less than stellar reputation.</p>
<p>Jerry said that the fact that this has so far been such a smooth project is almost unbelievable, given that on closing day he’d had no idea where to start looking for a good, honest contractor. “Without Sweeten, I would have randomly chosen a company I found on my own,” he confesses—and may or may not have had success.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They had the peace of mind of having the service &#8220;be the middleman,&#8221; he said. &#8220;W</span><span class="s1">ith Sweeten, the contractors are more accountable. Suddenly, my experience and satisfaction matter much more which is great.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40727 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-Before-04.jpg" alt="bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-Before-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-Before-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-Before-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40737 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-10.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Janet-and-Jerry-Tsong-Garden-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Now, with the end nearly in sight, they feel successful indeed. The apartment is gorgeous, livable, and comfortable. “Soon it will be rented out to a lucky tenant,” Jerry said, “and we’ll move to the top floor.” Check back to see how Janet and Jerry make the upstairs apartment their own.</p>
<p><em>Thank you for sharing, Janet and Jerry, and we look forward to the next phase!</em></p>

<p><strong>Sweeten&#8217;s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to our first installment of a series in which I hope to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating. We hear your questions every day and work happily to bring you answers through our team and blog. Whether you&#8217;re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings a new set of circumstances and new queries with it. Feel free to email me at JBrownhill@sweeten.com. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll even include questions that I get asked most often—even at cocktail parties!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, our question is about brownstones, and if this topic interests you, be sure to check out Part 1 of Nazli&#8217;s post on her and her husband Larry&#8217;s full gut four-story townhouse reno, a story filled with helpful insights and a refreshingly candid take on their experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>QUESTION: What should homeowners keep in mind before jumping into a brownstone renovation?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN:</strong> I think most people get really excited about the interiors, especially as New Yorkers. We’re used to mostly having apartments or spaces where we are pretty much focused only on the interior. But the big change comes when you go from a regular apartment renovation to a brownstone renovation or an actual piece of property, and you’re still tempted to focus on the interiors. After all, that’s where it’s going to be fun&#8230;that’s where you’re going to live.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I highly recommend people fall in love with all the details of their roof, and all the details of their basement—places where apartment dwellers usually rely on a super and don&#8217;t ever have to worry. So when you’re thinking about a brownstone renovation, really look at the integrity of the roof and the integrity of the basement. Those are the areas you want to get right before you even start on the interiors. Every time it rains, you don&#8217;t want your heart skipping a beat wondering if your roof is leaking. Or if it&#8217;s raining hard, you don&#8217;t want to be stressed out worrying, &#8220;Oh my god, is my basement flooding?&#8221; So fall in love with the roof and the basement. Because that’s really the difference. Yes, you’re getting a ton more space, and yes, you’re getting a backyard, but start at the top and the bottom.</p>

<p>Jerry and Janet&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">historic brownstone</a> needed major work, including a facelift of the building&#8217;s exterior, so they turned to a gut renovation with the goal of creating the perfect mix of old and new.</p>
