<h2>Etiquette isn&#8217;t just for formal occasions! Read on for simple etiquette tips for working with your contractor.</h2>
<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to #13 in our Renovation Question series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, we&#8217;re tackling a question regarding etiquette for working with a general contractor and their crew. Luckily, with some small gestures and clear communication, you&#8217;ll set yourself up for success.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the proper etiquette when working with a general contractor?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>When a general contractor crew is working in your home, I think people wonder about things like &#8220;Do I offer them water?&#8221; or &#8220;Can I contact them during off-hours?&#8221; Obviously, it&#8217;s up to you. Just keep in mind that these folks are in your home for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long period of time</a>. Anything you can do to maintain a professional relationship and make it a pleasant work environment is positive. We want people to be comfortable and to be as productive as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Setting up a separate text thread using apps such as WhatsApp versus direct texting offers a specific place to discuss business that is not on personal time. If your contractor&#8217;s team will be in a hot apartment, it&#8217;s a nice gesture to have a refrigerator filled with water for them. Similarly, you can make bathroom arrangements for them. It doesn&#8217;t have to be yours, but you could make sure that there&#8217;s a bathroom in your building they can use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After you&#8217;ve <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-important-when-hiring-a-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hired</a> a Sweeten contractor, letting the other contractors know that you&#8217;ve moved forward with another firm and thanking them for their time is a courteous way to close the loop.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Jean-Signature-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-35417"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35417 size-medium" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Jean-Signature-1-300x161.jpg" alt="Jean-Signature (1)" width="300" height="161" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Jean-Signature-1-300x161.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Jean-Signature-1-600x322.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Jean-Signature-1.jpg 793w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</strong></b>: Revamp an outdated kitchen in Kensington, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Racquel scored a deal when she found her 800-square-foot co-op in an estate sale, though she knew the kitchen (that hadn’t been updated since the ‘60s) would need work. “The first thing I did when I put my offer in was ask people how to get the kitchen done. It looked like it belonged in a museum. I kept staring at the stove—I could not believe it,” she said. Her renovation journey, however, got off to a rocky start. After a year of work with a kitchen designer she found through an ad on Facebook, walkthroughs without results, a quick purchase of a too-big fridge, and poor communication overall, Racquel had enough and took a year off from the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36159 mb-0 size-chrono" title="racquel-standing-in-her-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="racquel standing in her kitchen near window after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once she felt ready to take it on again, a friend, who was <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23924" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating her house</a> with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> and had joined <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/referral/friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their referral program</a>, suggested Racquel give them a try. “My friend said, ‘I’ve already started with Sweeten and they’re great.’ I was done trying to find people on my own that I couldn&#8217;t properly vet. I needed people who knew the business,” Racquel explained. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5865" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project </a>with the goal of bringing the old-fashioned space to the 21st century while maintaining a feeling of playfulness and joy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Once she was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377">this general contractor</a>, work began. Some debate about the stove ensued, but ultimately she decided to replace it. After living with it for over two years, “I had a Stockholm Syndrome relationship with my stove,” she said. While her initial thought was to incorporate quirky touches in the main elements of the kitchen, like using butcher block for the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countertops</a>, she decided to stick with modern, easy-to-clean materials, and incorporate more of her personality through accessories and paint. The white glossy cabinets with simple matte black hardware achieved that sleek look while offering a neutral backdrop for a creamy yellow wall and colorful knick-knacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The elevator broke down, which caused some minor hiccups. The stove, which was set to be delivered, had to be delayed and was then lost. Despite the holdup, Racquel’s renovation was completed within the three-week time period the general contractor had quoted from the beginning. “He worked around the issues without batting an eyelash,” she said. He even joined her on a trip to IKEA, waited for the cabinets, and brought them to her home the next morning. “He told me every day what was going to happen that day, and that’s exactly what happened,” she continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36155 mb-24 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-and-herringbone-backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with black handles and off-white countertop and yellow walls and herringbone backsplash and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-cabinets-and-yellow-walls"  class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-36151" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with white countertop and yellow wall and undermount stainless steel sink with brushed nickel pull down faucet and herringbone backsplash after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/first-time-renovators-share-their-stories-vol-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-time renovator</a>, Racquel shared this advice: “Resist the urge to rip things out before you have a chance to live with it. If I hadn’t, I don’t think I would’ve made the best decisions,” she said. Her patience certainly paid off. “Sometimes I walk into the kitchen with the sun coming in and it feels like a postcard. It looks like a magazine,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The cabinets were still a little difficult for Racquel to reach, so the contractor also left a space for her ladder between the fridge and the wall, so she’d have easy access to it when she needed to reach higher shelves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Metro Gris 12 in. x 24 in. porcelain floor tiles and Greecian white herringbone backsplash: <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>. Ringhult cabinets and Norssjön sink: <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA</a>. Nouveau III Collection cabinet knobs and pulls, and Progress overhead lighting: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>. Summit 28” refrigerator, Bosch 18” dishwasher, Frigidaire 30” microwave, and Frigidaire 30” gas range: <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AJMadison</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>QUESTION: How do I document change orders? </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>Each general contractor has his or her own methodology when it comes to documenting change orders (changes that alter the original scope agreed and signed upon), but they should definitely be documented in some way. Change orders can be as simple as a contractor opening up a wall and discovering that pipes or electrical wires need to be replaced or updated before installing an appliance. Another common change order is when a renovator chooses materials that require special installation, such as a tile that has a complex pattern or is very small or large-format.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Documenting can be a quick snap of a photo with a written description and the cost; just make sure that changes are documented, understood, and approved on your end before they move forward. Have that conversation up front with your general contractor because inevitably (or I would say with most projects), there are at least one or two change orders.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: How many contractor bids should I get? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>We find that three bids give you a really good sense of where the price range for your scope of work falls. You also get the chance to meet different personality types of general contractors so that you can <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find the best fit</a> for the way <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-important-when-hiring-a-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you like to communicate</a> and for your project.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Welcome to #10 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p><em>Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a> with any reno questions or dilemmas you&#8217;d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: How much time should I set aside for selecting and ordering materials?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>The amount of time really depends on your selection process. When I go shopping, I like to be in and out of the store as soon as possible, but I have plenty of friends who spend a lot of time looking for the perfect pair of jeans. Start by considering how you shop in other areas of your life and how much time you like to spend researching and comparing prices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to choosing and deciding on materials on your own, it&#8217;s a good idea to communicate with your contractor on the product items you&#8217;re considering; different materials require different levels of labor. For example, a mosaic tile is harder to set and needs a much more skilled subcontractor than what a standard penny round tile would call for. To keep things running smoothly, it&#8217;s best to have everything ordered before the renovation begins. So, give yourself plenty of time to see what you like and keep your general contractor in the loop throughout the process.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Welcome to #9 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p><em>Feel free to email me at <strong><a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a></strong> with any reno questions or dilemmas you&#8217;d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>What is an alteration agreement?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>If you live in a co-op or condo building in New York City, you&#8217;ll have an alteration agreement. In the document, your board lays out all of the rules and guidelines for renovating in your building to ensure there is minimum disruption to your neighbors while a renovation is in progress. This can include rules on the allowable work hours (to limit noise) and when the freight elevator will be open for deliveries or materials. When you&#8217;re buying, or if you&#8217;re thinking about renovating in a co-op or condo, you should read your alteration agreement immediately before talking to a general contractor; you&#8217;ll need to share those guidelines right from the start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another important piece of information usually found in the agreement is how much insurance your building requires. This amount is usually from $1 million to $3 million, which you&#8217;ll want to relay to any contractors you&#8217;re speaking with in order to make sure that they have that coverage in place before they even step foot inside your home. If you <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project on Sweeten</a> and include this amount in your profile, Sweeten will make sure to only match you to contractors who can cover the requirement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have more questions on the topic, check out our blog post <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renovating? Here&#8217;s How to Navigate a Co-op Board</a>.</p>

<h3>In need of something bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way and an energetic dog named Alfie, Terri Lee and Brett Appel needed a larger apartment. The couple had a design advantage from the start: Brett runs his own custom residential architecture practice and Terri works for one of the largest architecture firms in New York. They wanted to find something that they could gut renovate and design to their own specifications.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30.jpg" alt="Brett sitting on a chair posing for photo near built-in book shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51517" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A completely gutted remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath apartment was in an 82-unit co-op in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. It was in terrible condition, which made it easier to rip everything out and redesign the apartment exactly the way they wanted. They found their contractor after talking with friends (one of whom is also an architect) who <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had used Sweeten</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08.jpg" alt="open living and dining with hardwood floors and white walls and half wall book shelves as room divider or partition after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51495" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terri and Brett posted their project</a> on Sweeten, they were upfront about the existing conditions and scope of work. They wanted a contractor who would tell them whether the work could be done within their budget, or if they needed to scale back. “Fortunately, we found the right contractor who was very happy to work with us so we could get everything we wanted,” Brett said.</p>

<h3>Making the space look bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple’s design vision was to combine shades of gray with natural wood to make the home seem as bright and large as possible without being too monotone. “We also didn’t want the renovated space to compete with our brightly colored furniture,” Brett said. Their primary objective in terms of gaining space was to add a second bathroom, which they achieved by rearranging the bedroom doors and reducing the size of the hallway closets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02.jpg" alt="dining with white walls and ceiling girder and hardwood floors and half wall book shelf divider partition after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51489" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Challenges in the foyer</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The entry foyer was a bit of a challenge. It’s two steps above the living room and contains the dining space, which was small. They relocated the steps down to the living room from the center to the side and replaced the guardrails with a continuous double-sided built-in bookcase custom-designed by the contractor’s millworker. The raised platform was extended to create a larger dining space, while the closet expanded for more stroller storage. New wide-plank European oak engineered flooring was installed throughout.</p>

<h3>Rearranging the walls</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they found the apartment, the existing walls were plaster—probably at least 60 years old and poorly done. “One of the walls in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room was so uneven and bumpy</a>, it looked like it was made out of pillowcases,” Brett recalled. They ultimately decided to fur out the walls–a process to construct a new wall in front of the old one. “We attached 1x3s to the existing wall and then put new sheetrock on those. We lost a little space (about 1 1/2&#8243; per wall), but this saved us about $6,000,” Brett said. The other option to straighten crooked walls would have been &#8220;demolishing the plaster and lathe, placing new studs, and then new sheetrock,&#8221; which would have been more expensive and time-consuming.</p>

<h3>Covering the radiator</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The master bedroom closet was reframed to function as a walk-in. Other details included the custom radiator covers in the bedroom and living room, crafted by the millworker; leftover stone from the kitchen counters was used for the radiator sills.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Terri and Brett designed these covers together. The existing radiators had an old painted steel cover that had not weathered very well. The millworker made the slatted fronts on removable clips so the radiator could be accessed for maintenance. The new millwork needed a top/windowsill but the couple decided that painted MDF would not last very long. Brett had to purchase two slabs of stone for the kitchen to cover the countertops and backsplash. There was a lot of leftover stone that easily fit the sills.</p>

<h3>An ADA-compliant layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We didn’t have a lot of flexibility designing the kitchen and bathroom layouts. It had to be ADA-compliant since we rearranged everything,” Brett explained. They focused on finishes. In the kitchen, they imagined the countertops and backsplash as the “feature” elements with everything else as the background, &#8220;which is why the floors and cabinets are all different shades of gray,” he said. The couple loves unique, natural stones and found that quartzites have the most movement and veining, which worked well with their gray cabinets.</p>

<span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Master bath</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both bathrooms were made to seem bigger and brighter by making the walls white and using marble tile in the master and subway tile in the guest. In the master bath, Brett said, he “had some fun connecting the shower niche with the existing windowsill.” Terri scoured the Internet to find an aquatic-themed wallpaper for the guest bathroom. Wood shelves were incorporated in each to provide a little warmth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brett was most excited about the new rain shower in the added bathroom. “All of my previous apartments—for basically my entire life—only had a bathtub, so it feels very luxurious to shower in a large glass box,” he said.</p>

<h3>A recommendation for clients</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the renovation, Brett had wanted to test out Sweeten’s service to see if he would recommend it to his own clients. After this experience, he said he would. “We didn’t need much assistance from Sweeten because I have experience managing projects like these professionally, but I felt reassured knowing that Sweeten would be able to assist if any serious problems came up. Luckily, our contractor was great and we didn’t have any issues,” Brett said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Terri and I are perpetually impressed that we were able to design the apartment exactly to our needs,&#8221; says Brett. &#8220;Our families come over frequently now and we love that we were able to add a second bathroom. It really helps make ‘our’ space feel more private.&#8221; As an architect couple, they worked well together. &#8220;It helps to come up with a central concept or theme at the beginning,&#8221; Brett said. &#8220;There will always be disagreements but we could then ask ourselves &#8216;does this fit our initial vision&#8217; and make a decision together.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>Temporary walls are a way for you to protect the parts of your home that are not being renovated from all the dust and debris that is created from the parts that are. We see a lot of people using zipper walls, which are made of sheets of plastic. The plastic allows the space to be completely sealed off but still accessible because of the zipper. If you are doing a renovation that affects your entire home or apartment, you don&#8217;t need temporary walls, because everything is going to end up dusty and will need to be cleaned once the project is complete.</p>
<hr />

<hr />
<p>If you are renovating your kitchen only, then we suggest creating a barrier between the space that&#8217;s being renovated and the spaces that are not, especially if you&#8217;re living in the home while the work is being done. If this is the case, be mindful of the particles in the air, some of which can be harmful to your health. You&#8217;ll want to keep all of those particles on the other side of the temporary walls.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>When happily-ever-after meets home renovation</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or you’ve owned a home before, taking the plunge and moving in with your partner is both thrilling and terrifying. Throw a renovation into the mix and suddenly the notion of a shared space that’s both personal and cohesive can seem impossible—especially if you’re a first-time renovator as well. Take heart that it can be done. Read on to meet five couples who combined romance and renovation with help from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Amy_and_Nick_Apartment.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30655 size-chrono" title="Amy and Nick" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Amy_and_Nick_Apartment-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26525 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First-time homeowners and renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy and Nick</a> wanted to avoid a renovation at all costs. Things changed when they came across an outdated 2-bed, 1-bath condo in Prospect Heights that was just the right size and layout for them to imagine their home together. The couple moved in and started saving for a renovation. While remodeling, they refreshed the worn-out bath and tore out the triangular-shaped kitchen, replacing it with new cabinets, appliances, and a custom 10-foot-long island topped with sparkling Carrara marble. And if you’re wondering how Amy and Nick feel about the results, just ask Amy. “We use the kitchen and joint living spaces for relaxing, cooking, and entertaining. The room has all the things that make us happy.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29012 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom05-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom02-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29015 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom02-1-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-work-triangle-sets-off-a-brooklyn-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">These homeowners</a> spent a year dreaming about the possibilities of renovating their two-bedroom co-op in Brooklyn—their first as a couple—before they kicked things off by hiring a general contractor. Despite the many windows and breathtaking views of the city, the apartment felt crowded and closed-off. They opened up the layout by removing the wall separating the kitchen from the living room and installed an island—a feature that they had both loved from their childhood kitchens. The changes improved the overall flow and flooded the space with sunlight. Creative choices—from the bright green backsplash in the kitchen to the warm gold fixtures in the bath—allowed them to inject their personality into the space.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua</a>, a newly engaged couple, planned on transforming Erica’s apartment—the home she had grown to love, despite its quirks, over the past 10 years—into the perfect space to begin their new lives together. The renovation focused on opening up and updating the kitchen. &#8220;We were seeking to strike a balance between Joshua’s partiality to completely open spaces and my desire to keep some visual privacy,&#8221; says Erica. Custom cabinets replaced builder-grade cabinetry and a new peninsula provided generous storage and a place for the duo to dine. &#8220;Joshua also dreamed of replacing the parquet. I much preferred parquet so those conversations often ended in agreeing to disagree,&#8221; she said. After speaking to their contractor, &#8220;Joshua was right. The floors needed to be replaced.&#8221;<span class="s1"> </span>The apartment is now cozy—instead of cramped—and overflowing with natural light. At the end of the renovation, Erica found that there was so much more to love about her home.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/becky-kitchen-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Becky and Sarah</a> moved in together with the intention of renovating their kitchen, but the project was put on hold. When it came time to renovate, the planning stage involved a few different versions until they settled on the right design; an open kitchen with shelves instead of upper cabinets. To make sure there was enough storage, they installed an island with pull-out drawers and nestled the fridge within cabinetry. While the project was stressful at times, the results were well worth the effort. Once the punch list was complete, the couple got engaged. “It could have torn us apart but in the end it bonded us together,” said Sarah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24316 size-chrono" title="Jonathan and Cecilia" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24325 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While searching for their first home together, Cecilia was looking for a place within walking distance of shops and subway stations, while Jonathan wanted a fixer-upper with plenty of square footage. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couple</a> combined their requirements and fed the list into a computer code that Jonathan had written to find his first apartment. The code scoured real estate websites and narrowed down the results so that they only looked at the ones that met their needs. Renovating their home led them to a unified design for the main living spaces, while also allowing them to create their own spaces where it mattered the most: in this case, his and her bathrooms.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Welcome to #6 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p><em>Feel free to email me at <strong><a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a></strong> with any reno questions or dilemmas you&#8217;d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>What is skim coating and why is it so expensive?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>Skim coating is a process that essentially makes your walls look perfect. Every wall is a sandwich of different materials. Those materials—drywall, tape, and mud—are there to help insulate your home and keep you warm and dry. When it comes to the interior finish, you’ll want it to look as smooth as possible, and that’s really hard when, from certain angles, you can see where all of those materials come together. Skim coating takes the same mud that is used in the construction of the walls and spreads it across the surface—almost like a layer of frosting—before smoothing it by hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you need skim coating? No. Is it amazing when it’s done really well? Yes, because your walls look perfect under any kind of lighting. Why is it so expensive? Because someone has to go on a ladder with a flashlight and hand-sand the walls to make sure they’re perfectly smooth. That takes a while because it’s a vertical surface. It’s certainly your choice, but it definitely looks beautiful when it’s done.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Welcome to #5 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating and answer questions we hear on a daily basis! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new queries, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance.</em></p>
<p><em>Feel free to email me at <strong><a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a></strong> with any reno questions or dilemmas you&#8217;d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Are wood floors a good investment?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>With so many flooring choices available, everyone can express their own sense of aesthetics. The reason why wood floors make a good investment as a type of material is their versatility. They allow you, or the next owner, to sand them down and restain or refinish them. Obviously, you could pull up an existing carpet and start over again, or you could re-tile, but wood floors allow you the capability of refinishing the same wood surface which makes them a very attractive option. When I&#8217;m asked the best way to transform a space on a budget, my answer is to redo the floors. This can change every square foot of your home, with one renovation.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What&#8217;s an important quality to remember when hiring a general contractor?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN:</strong> After a homeowner posts his or her project with Sweeten and has reviewed general contractor matches, the next focus should be communication style. Simply put, you want to find a contractor with whom you can communicate well and who has a similar style to yours. Are you the type of person who wants phone calls, text messages, or only emails? Is having everything documented, including receiving a daily update, more comfortable for you, or are you more laid back? Do you tend to be upfront and direct or less so? Whatever is your preference, be sure those points of communication are aligned between you and the contractor you choose.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to #3 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating and answer questions we hear on a daily basis! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new queries, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com"><span class="s2">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</span></a> with any reno questions or dilemmas you&#8217;d like addressed.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, our question is about the punch list; if this topic interests you, I’d suggest checking out our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">downloadable renovation checklist</span></a> which provides some guidance on mapping out your plans.<br />
</span><strong><br />
QUESTION:</strong> What is a construction punch list?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>The punch list is the roster of items that need to be done for the renovation to be complete. The vast majority of the work has been finished, but there are still details to be resolved; the list could go on forever, so it’s necessary for you to sit down and define the list for your general contractor. You have one shot to compile your punch list, and once it is done, the project is officially—boom—done! The best idea I’ve heard is from Stephen Fanuka from DIY Network’s Million Dollar Contractor. He advises clients to place a pad of paper in each renovated room and for two weeks, not to speak to their contractor. Make note of everything you see that needs fixing when you are living in the space and at the end of the two weeks, collect those pages and hand them to the contractor. That&#8217;s your punch list.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to #2 in our series, Q&amp;A with Jean, in which I hope to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating. We hear your questions every day and work happily to bring you answers through our team and blog. Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings a new set of circumstances and new queries with it. Feel free to email me at JBrownhill@sweeten.com. In the meantime, I’ll even include questions that I get asked most often—even at cocktail parties!</p>
<p>Today our question is about the costs of home renovation in New York City; if this topic interests you, I&#8217;d suggest checking out our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bath</a> cost guides, including <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Budget Basics: Renovation Costs Per Square Foot</a>.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Why is renovating in New York City so expensive?</p>
<p><strong>JEAN:</strong> Like a lot of things in NYC, it comes down to logistics. For a general contractor to transport the drywall and studs—not mention the many other materials and tools necessary for the job—to your home, the planning can be really complicated. Not only does the team need to get everything to your apartment building, they need to get it up to your floor. Sometimes that means coordinating with an elevator, but in some cases, it can mean using a crane and craning in materials. What adds to the high cost of the materials part of a bid is the logistics.</p>
<p>The labor side of the equation is equally complicated. A lot of renovation projects going on simultaneously in the city and every contractor needs a tiler, a plumber, an electrician, etc. In order to survive the competition, he/she has to pay a premium to get a crew to show up at your job site. It all comes down to supply and demand. There are only so many skilled laborers in the city, and getting those laborers plus materials to your apartment can be challenging. Even for a house in Brooklyn, the crew still has to drive through traffic and bring the drywall from a warehouse that&#8217;s likely stationed in another borough, like Queens. Overall, it’s the cumulative expense of coordinating the drivers, trucks, and deliveries, plus having someone ready to accept deliveries and bring it to your home, that really drives up the cost.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten&#8217;s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to our first installment of a series in which I hope to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating. We hear your questions every day and work happily to bring you answers through our team and blog. Whether you&#8217;re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings a new set of circumstances and new queries with it. Feel free to email me at JBrownhill@sweeten.com. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll even include questions that I get asked most often—even at cocktail parties!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, our question is about brownstones, and if this topic interests you, be sure to check out Part 1 of Nazli&#8217;s post on her and her husband Larry&#8217;s full gut four-story townhouse reno, a story filled with helpful insights and a refreshingly candid take on their experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>QUESTION: What should homeowners keep in mind before jumping into a brownstone renovation?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN:</strong> I think most people get really excited about the interiors, especially as New Yorkers. We’re used to mostly having apartments or spaces where we are pretty much focused only on the interior. But the big change comes when you go from a regular apartment renovation to a brownstone renovation or an actual piece of property, and you’re still tempted to focus on the interiors. After all, that’s where it’s going to be fun&#8230;that’s where you’re going to live.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I highly recommend people fall in love with all the details of their roof, and all the details of their basement—places where apartment dwellers usually rely on a super and don&#8217;t ever have to worry. So when you’re thinking about a brownstone renovation, really look at the integrity of the roof and the integrity of the basement. Those are the areas you want to get right before you even start on the interiors. Every time it rains, you don&#8217;t want your heart skipping a beat wondering if your roof is leaking. Or if it&#8217;s raining hard, you don&#8217;t want to be stressed out worrying, &#8220;Oh my god, is my basement flooding?&#8221; So fall in love with the roof and the basement. Because that’s really the difference. Yes, you’re getting a ton more space, and yes, you’re getting a backyard, but start at the top and the bottom.</p>

<p>Jerry and Janet&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">historic brownstone</a> needed major work, including a facelift of the building&#8217;s exterior, so they turned to a gut renovation with the goal of creating the perfect mix of old and new.</p>

</a><a href="https://dbryantarchie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D. Bryant Archie</a> is a textile designer and Brooklyn homeowner member of Sweeten community. D&#8217;s apartment, located in Prospect Lefferts Gardens, is painted with rich deep color tones while her bathroom was a basic Decorator&#8217;s White. So she hired one of our members to paint the bathroom with vertical strips in Benjamin Moore China White and Onyx. Now her bathroom works to complete &amp; compliment the overall look and feel of the apartment.</p>
