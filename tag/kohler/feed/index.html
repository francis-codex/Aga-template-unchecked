<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>A ranch-style Georgia home with appeal</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We bought this 1958 home in Atlanta’s Buckhead section with plans to renovate right away. Nothing was wrong, per se, but we knew we wanted to remodel. The plan was to improve the layout and exterior façade and update the kitchen and bathrooms. A big project would also turn the primary bedroom into a true master suite.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21.jpg" alt="Den with fireplace, couches, chairs, grand piano, and hanging fan" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52190" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are Jenna and Hagan, now parents to two daughters: Clay, 2, and Sloan, 7 months. Henry, our dog, lives here, too. When we found the house, we were still expecting our second child and I was working from home due to the pandemic. More space and some rooms to relax in were all we could think about.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>A mid-century remodel focused on good bones with potential</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Our ranch-style home, in the Chastain Park neighborhood, comprises 3,000 square feet. It has a backyard with mature trees, and the house benefits from pretty views and lots of natural light. The interior was traditionally styled, and we liked it. We felt, however, that we could make it work better for our family, and set out to do that. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and the team quickly sourced four quality contractors for us to consider. We soon <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6751#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a general contractor</a> who inspired our confidence. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23.jpg" alt="A view of the white painted brick fireplace from behind the tan couch" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52192" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22.jpg" alt="The grand piano in the renovated den with a large plant" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52191" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We brought floorplans to our meetings, as layout changes were the most challenging part of the project. Our house had a lot of storage space that we saw a potential to put to better use. These would include the bedroom areas as well as more useful spaces for the kitchen area.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the den, our contractor removed a large built-in shelf that had started to separate from the wall. We also painted this room and stained the floor dark brown.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20.jpg" alt="View into the two doors to the living areas from the entryway" width="1000" height="1545" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52189" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20-194x300.jpg 194w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20-583x900.jpg 583w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">&#8220;The contractor replaced the windows top to bottom to improve insulation. We could see early signs of rotting wood in the old windows.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A new bay window brightens the kitchen</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The plan for the kitchen included putting in a bay window in the existing breakfast nook and installing Dolomite marble countertops. We ordered a new kitchen sink and added a subway tile backsplash. We kept the existing cabinets, switching out the knobs for a fast refresh. To increase function in this section of the house, we turned to old closets. Opening up the boxed-in space of the four lining the back hallway made space for a butler’s pantry with a second fridge. We also built a laundry room in this area in a follow-up to the larger renovation. </span></p>

<h3>Transforming closets for a master suite</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the back of the house, closets (again) and one of the offices gave their square footage to enlarge our master suite and another bedroom. For the master suite, we imagined a large, open bedroom area looking out into the backyard. We would also add a walk-in closet, a big bathroom, and a powder room. The remap worked brilliantly. An existing door was repurposed as a sliding barn door and leads to our master walk-in closet. The contractor built a secret door at its back that lets us quickly get to the kids’ bedrooms during the night. It has come in handy!</span></p>

<h3 class="p4">Three bathrooms with new tile</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bathroom renovations came next. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/how-to-save-on-home-remodeling-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We did them economically</a>—as in almost simultaneously. Each bath got new tile, though we retained usable fixtures and hardware</span><span class="s1"> where we could. At one point, we had three bathrooms torn up. The one in use had a shower only, and our two-year-old was terrified of showers! We were pleased when the child’s bathroom, replete with new tub and penny tile floor, was finished—not to mention the other three. Our beautiful master bath, with a freestanding fluted bathtub, a glass-walled shower, and double sinks got the full marble treatment. The color palette was a mix of gray and white, including sleek large-sheet floor tiles</span><span class="s1">. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15.jpg" alt="Bathroom with light blue walls, white floors, white shower curtain, and decorative mirror" width="1000" height="668" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52186" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Whole-house improvements for curb appeal</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Much of the house had hardwood flooring in need of refinishing. From the bedrooms to the living room, den, foyer, and kitchen, the contractors sanded and stained them. In another global redo, the contractor replaced the windows top to bottom to improve insulation. We could see early signs of rotting wood in the old windows. The new kitchen bay window </span><span class="s1">looks great from the inside and <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/curb-appeal-goes-a-long-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhances the home’s curb appeal</a>. The house would also get a new coat of exterior paint. </span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A Sweeten general contractor to count on</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Through it all, our Sweeten contractor was reliable and competent. He was diligent with the permitting process, a delay-ridden challenge during Covid. (Key takeaway: Be 100 percent sure you need a permit and factor it into your timeline!) Our contractor was transparent on costs, and his efforts resulted in a pleasing final product.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It’s been a feat, but finally, we feel settled. Jenna and I waited so long for our master suite—it feels magical to have our own space. The girls, and Henry the dog, are happy. We are home.</span></p>

<h3>Remodeling an outdated 80&#8217;s West Village kitchen</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36013 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-36010 size-full" title="jonathan-standing-in-kitchen-with-wife" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01.jpg" alt="jonathan standing in his kitchen with his wife in front of white kitchen cabinets and herringbone pattern subway tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<div></div>
<p>Though Erin and Jonathan’s West Village kitchen in their 750-square-foot apartment was, for the most part, functional, it didn’t suit their style. Another downside: the kitchen did not make the best use of the available space. Open to the living area, there was plenty of room to add the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in island</a> on the couple’s wish list, plus reimagine the layout. Ready to bid farewell to the ‘80s cabinetry and shabby tile flooring, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project to Sweeten</a> and were matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a general contractor</a>.</p>
<h3>Picking renovation materials and kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36018 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="waterfall-marble-island-with-pendant-lights"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floor and waterfall marble island with pendant lights and white walls after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36013 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36018 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-36018 size-full" title="waterfall-kitchen-island-with-cabinet-drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floor and waterfall marble island with pull out drawers inside cabinets and pendant lights after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The basic kitchen transformed into a bright, modern marvel complete with new stainless steel appliances, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/sleek-waterfall-island-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall island</a>, and light fixtures. The overall contemporary culinary space also got some more classic updates, like the Shaker-style cabinets and herringbone tile backsplash. To connect the kitchen with the rest of the living area, 5-inch white oak flooring was installed throughout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A French door refrigerator replaced the older model, while the new dishwasher (that has a window and lights up!) moved to the stove&#8217;s previous location. A stainless steel hood and gas range found a new central location in the space across from the storage-packed island.</p>
<h3>Working through the renovation process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor brought the couple’s vision to life, ensuring everything was on time and on budget. “The contractor’s app was also a very helpful tool for us to make material selections and track the progress of the project,” Jonathan said. Their contractor provided valuable input, guiding them on sourcing materials, layout, and space considerations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The entire process was intimidating. From planning, scheduling, prepping, and deciding, it was all new to us. Sweeten and our contractors made us feel at ease,” he continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation had its challenges (the couple moved into a sublet for three months), but it wrapped up beautifully. “Before, there was a daily struggle for space and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>. Getting a certain level of cleanliness was never attainable in an older apartment. Now when we walk in the door, it’s a breath of fresh air,” Jonathan said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: The countertops are actually marble-like quartz that doesn’t just look pretty; it’s very durable too!</p>

<h3 class="p3">Purchasing the right Brooklyn brownstone</h3>
<p>Isis, a brand and experiential marketing specialist, and Stephano, a nurse anesthetist, closed on their brownstone home at the end of 2018. It was a fixer-upper, with four floors comprising of a 3-story apartment for the family and a garden-level rental unit. Renovating the bathroom topped their priority list at first, but had to be postponed. “We’d gutted it but weren’t able to immediately redo it,” Isis said, “because we had to prioritize repairs to the roof and work on the downstairs unit.” With two kids and a third on the way, they were not excited about putting off the bathroom—a job that included expanding it to accommodate their growing family and a new laundry space.</p>

<h3 class="p3">How much, and how long?</h3>
<p class="p3">During the nearly two years that followed, the family muddled through. “We had everyone sharing one bathroom,” Stephano said—including, at times, Isis’s dad. When they finally had the time and resources to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">undertake the bathroom remodel</a>, they posted it on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, and were quickly introduced to several <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualified Brooklyn contractors</a>.</p>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" title="69496-Isis-Bath-08" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-08.jpg" alt="Large white double sink with bathroom mirror and closed vanity after renovation" width="667" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-08.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" title="69496-Isis-Bath-12" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50871" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-12.jpg" alt="White hexogan wall tiles with vanity and sink after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3">“The biggest questions we had were how much and how long,” Isis recalled, explaining that they’d heard horror stories of inflamed budgets and endless timeline extensions. They also tried to ascertain how well each of the candidates could communicate. “We hoped to work with a team that could convey all key info that might affect the timeline,&#8221; Isis said, &#8220;so that we could collaborate on workarounds.”</p>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" title="black-faucets-fixtures-in-white-bathroom" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50870" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-11.jpg" alt="white honeycomb or hexagon wall tiles and white marble on vanity with black faucet and fixtures after renovation" width="667" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-11.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p class="p3">Isis was relieved that Sweeten could smooth the process. “The company helped us gut-check our initial <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget based on the market</a> for our area,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They presented solid contractors for us to meet, and then checked in to make sure we felt pleased with our selection. I felt good about the consultant who supported us and the insights she shared.”</p>
<h3 class="p3">Measure twice, cut once</h3>
<p class="p3">Once they had made their contractor choice, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process for the bathroom</a> began—haltingly. Isis and Stephano had hired an independent designer, and brought the resulting plans to the table when discussing the project with their contractor. “The designer had measured, provided renderings, and even put us in touch with vendors,” Stephano said. They ordered many of the materials for the bathroom, included a barn door for the washer/dryer, a vanity, and stone for the two-sink top. Then—a hard stop. “Our contractor realized that many of the measurements didn’t jibe,” Stephano said.</p>

<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" title="69496-Isis-Bath-07" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50866" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-07.jpg" alt="All black shower area with built in wall shelf and black bathroom fitting after renovation" width="667" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-07.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p>The original washer and dryer, left behind by the previous owners, wouldn’t fit in the space the designer had planned for it. The vanity size was also off, and the door from the recommended vendor was too heavy to be installed as intended. “It wasn’t the best experience,” Isis said. But the couple persisted, fueled by their vision: a  <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">functional space for laundry</a>, and a shower lit by the morning sun through a skylight. And their Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor found solutions</a> to each of the problems created by the ill-chosen designer. Stephano offered his own solution to the barn door problem: he&#8217;d use his skills to build his own custom design, and worked with the contractor to incorporate it.</p>
<h3>Borrowing space to get a bigger bathroom</h3>
<p>To accommodate the whole family, and the laundry area, they knocked down an adjacent wall and annexed a pair of closets. One closet was <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/washer-dryer-bathroom-renovation-dumbo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebuilt to house the washer and dryer</a>—a pair of 24-inch stacking units to replace the original ones that didn&#8217;t match the designer&#8217;s drawings. Finding a creative way to <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incorporate the units into the bathroom</a>, Stephano said, “took amazing Tetris skills” on the part of their contractor. The enlarged space helped with other layout and storage challenges. “The shower is spacious! We added a custom cabinet that can hold all of our toiletry needs and were able to obtain a larger, double-sink vanity,” Isis said.</p>
<p>For finishes they chose a combination of black, white, and natural wood, with contrasting hex tiles and subway tiles. “Subway tile felt very NYC to us, so we led with that, but also liked hexagon tile for the floor,” Isis said. “In the shower, we opted for all black, which we totally love, and we’re happy with the custom walnut shelving, too.”</p>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" title="69496-Isis-Bath-09" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50868" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-09.jpg" alt="Open natural wood cabinet with toiletry and white hexogan wall tiles after renovation" width="667" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-09.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>

<h3 class="p6">Their general contractor was a great fit</h3>
<p class="p3">Both partners feel proud of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting their bathroom project</a> and the final outcome. “We took what we’d learned from other projects,” Isis said, “and used that knowledge to work really well with our Sweeten contractor and his team.” Stephano appreciated that their contractor was always available, “and was invested in both getting the work done and making sure we were satisfied.”</p>
<p class="p3">“I love the design, and how functional it is for all of our needs, including storage,” Isis said. &#8220;Thanks to the skylight, the bathroom has great natural light. She added, “I love the custom door Stephano made for us!” Perfectly weighted, and smooth-rolling.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Jennifer and Joe’s Edgewater, New Jersey, apartment looks out on the Manhattan skyline, Statue of Liberty, and George Washington Bridge. The couple and their dog have lived in the two-bedroom, two-bath condo for ten years and been slowly renovating room by room. When it came time to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reimagine their kitchen</a>, they knew an open concept was the only way to go. “We entertain so much and wanted a nice flow for people to congregate and socialize. We wanted clean lines, plus no obstructions or walls to block the view,” Jennifer shared. The soon-to-be renovators </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/35511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sweeten and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: With one partial wall separating the living area and kitchen, Jennifer had her heart set on creating a seamless, or wall-less, space. Upon inspection, the couple learned the entire wall couldn’t fully come down because it was loadbearing. Instead, their contractor left a little under three feet of the wall remaining—a perfect spot for the refrigerator.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZViC8qWml4U&amp;feature=youtu.be"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40877" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QA-AltAgreement.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QA-AltAgreement.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QA-AltAgreement-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QA-AltAgreement-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In place of the knocked-down wall came a marble waterfall island with a deep black base and white veins. The rest of the kitchen&#8217;s palette picks up from the marble, juxtaposing the two colors. Glossy black drawers are on one side of the island, while all-white upper and lower cabinetry, plus a white quartz countertop make up the rest of the cooking space. Since the whole concept revolved around clean lines, the renovators chose sleek, linear hardware for their cabinets and installed the microwave drawer underneath the counter to keep the surface clear. Not one detail was spared, from the under cabinet lighting to the textured backsplash.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This level of attention was consistent throughout the project. Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/new-jersey-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edgewater contractors</a> kept them involved in the process from start to finish. “Nothing was done without a full explanation or our understanding,” she said. “They made recommendations that were incredibly helpful and rather than feeling as though our arm was being twisted they helped us to make better decisions with their guidance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Communication</a> is one of the most crucial parts of any project, which Jennifer and Joe can definitely attest to. <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">constantly checked in and inquired as to our level of satisfaction. They asked us what stages of our project timeline we were in and it felt nice knowing that they were providing an open line of communication with us,” Jennifer shared. The couple has been through multiple renovations, so knew to brace themselves for problems, but fortunately didn’t encounter them.</span></p>

It is just the best.” </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Jennifer’s tip for future renovators? “Sign contracts that give you a firm start date, end date, and the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget</a> they will commit to. Our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractors were absolutely exceptional</a> in each of these areas. A contract that you can all live with and by is essential.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Repair a leak and update the look of a bathroom</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowner bought her 1931 West Village studio co-op in 2013 and gut renovated the entire space—minus the bathroom. Recently, the building’s management let her know that there was a major leak behind the walls. Since a portion of the bathroom would have to be demolished to identify the source and then fix the leak, she decided to go through with a full gut renovation.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was looking for a reputable and reasonably priced general contractor who would not only do a great job, but that I could fully trust and who would be flexible given the nature of the situation,&#8221; she shared. While resolving the issue and fixing the leak was the most important element of the project, the homeowner also wanted to make cosmetic changes to match the luxe, timeless, and high-quality feel of the rest of her renovated home.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-glass-doors"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48809 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tina-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="White bathroom with glass doors before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tina-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tina-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tina-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><strong>After</strong></span>: The homeowner <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/admin/projects/32036" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project to Sweeten</a> and received multiple matches and bids. When she met one of her matches in person and “thought he was too good to be true,” the homeowner requested references she could speak to directly. “His references described him as someone who was honest and trustworthy, hardworking, easy to work with, did high-quality work, and would do whatever it took to make a client happy,” she said. After <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matching with the general contractor</a>, she soon found out the references were spot on.</p>
<p>They tackled the renovation together, focusing first on repairing the leak and subsequent damage, and from there, honing in on the look and adding more storage. She consulted with a designer, <a href="https://www.damonliss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Damon Liss</a>, who helped out on her previous renovation, and he suggested where to go for materials. Ultimately the finishes were selected to be cohesive and consistent with the rest of the home. That meant lots of natural and marble stone, plus polished chrome hardware. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowner went to the Kohler experience store and worked with a salesperson to select fixtures.</span> She gave up a bit of shower space to add in a bigger vanity and decided against centering the sink to maximize counter space.</p>

Throughout the experience, there were those expected, and otherwise, challenges that the general contractor helped her navigate. For example, when they waterproofed the shower to meet New York City code, the building engineer informed them that the building had a higher standard than the city. An additional layer of protection would be needed to meet the building’s standards. The general contractor quickly took action to make the necessary updates. He also stepped into conversations with suppliers to move things along and paid close attention to the project status throughout the process. The homeowner was particularly concerned about an involved renovation and construction process going on in the already-finished home. “My general contractor and his team took great care with my apartment, built trust quickly, and drove a high standard on all aspects of the project,&#8221; she shared.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the renovator did have to move out of her home for the project to be completed, her general contractor and his team made the whole process easy and manageable. “Even my building management and suppliers were blown away by his professionalism, work ethic, attitude, and quality of work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall, I’m really happy with the result and how the process went,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “I will only ever buy something that I can renovate,” the homeowner said. She loves the creative process, from picking materials to seeing the space come together.</span></p>

<h3>Remodeling a brownstone for the future</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My wife B and I loved our little one-bedroom duplex in Hell’s Kitchen, but it had two drawbacks. It was small and the spiral staircase was a safety hazard we suspected would only worsen as we got older. Our budget was tight for the two-bed, two-bath apartment we wanted, but we felt it was time to make the move.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Focusing on Park Slope, we were outbid on two apartments: one that wasn&#8217;t perfect and another with a cute balcony. It became clear that we needed to look at apartments below our budget so we could bid higher, but there wasn’t much in that range.</p>

<h3>Finding a solution in a fixer-upper home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, I expanded my search to include places with only one bathroom, and saw an apartment pop up that fit our budget—the listing said, “Bring your contractor.” It was a big mess, but at least it was big! I rushed to an early open house on a Wednesday morning so I could be one of the first to see it. As I left, I texted B, “It needs a lot of work, but it just feels like home.” She came back with me that Sunday and was equally smitten with the place. We had to outbid 11 other offers, but this time, we got it!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18.jpg" alt="Living area with window nook alcove and open door to the office" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52131 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three-bed, one-bath (now two-bath) co-op is on the 2nd floor of a brownstone building in the center of Park Slope. The bathroom was in desperate need of an update, and the kitchen was more or less non-existent (there were a few cabinets and a sink). We didn’t know if we needed an architect, a contractor, a designer, or all of the above. After speaking to a few of each, none thought they could complete the work we needed in the range of our budget. That&#8217;s when we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/15942" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project</a> on Sweeten to find a contractor who had the experience to take on the work. We were matched with a few and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired our general contractor</a>.</p>
<h3>Opting for a full-home remodel in Brooklyn</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to take the plunge and do a full-home remodel on the Park Slope brownstone apartment, including installing new 5&#8243;-wide oak floors in a cherry stain, replacing crumbling plaster walls with drywall, and adding a washer/dryer in the hallway closet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17.jpg" alt="Office with black desk, book shelves, and large window" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52132 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16.jpg" alt="Living room with gray couch, gray walls, and a blue wall niche" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52130 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the sense of history in the home and wanted to save as many of the original features as possible. Some <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">molding was salvaged</a> and matched as closely as possible. The majority of the tin ceiling was saved along with the exposed brick walls and the Deco-style fireplace in our living room. The fireplace has a fresh coat of paint. Sadly, we weren’t able to save the beautiful French doors, but one now hangs horizontally on the living room wall as a piece of art.</p>

<h3>Making the space personal</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond matching the existing style, we wanted an apartment that felt cozy and creative. For me, as a writer, that meant lots of space for books. The existing small study, where one of the two doorways was removed and a transom was added, was the perfect spot for our collection. In addition, the writer in me also loved the bay window. I envisioned a banquette underneath for writing and lounging and storage as an added bonus. <span style="color: #333333;">Sitting curled up on that bench with a book is now one of my favorite activities. (Editor&#8217;s note: the owners added the banquette </span>after the photoshoot.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-52126 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="View of the open plan kitchen with counter space and seating, and adjacent hallway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="Kitchen with stainless steel appliances and gray cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52127 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen was probably the biggest transformation. The only appliance in the kitchen was a small, cheap stove that the sellers brought in for the inspection, a small sink, and a few metal cabinets. Luckily, that area needed very little demo! <span style="color: #333333;">Our contractor gave us a 3D rendering of our wishlist—a large peninsula for bar stools, ample storage space including deep drawers for our pots and pans, and the triangular configuration for our stove, sink, and fridge.</span></p>

<h3>Finding the right accents and patterns</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We tried to bring in our “cozy and creative” feel through the fixtures and furniture. Our contractor sourced most of our materials⁠, besides the lighting and appliances. As a result, this gave us more time to focus on finding the right accent pieces.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor helped us to figure out the best layout in the apartment. Since we were planning to put in a second bathroom, we wanted to create an ensuite master bedroom. Consequently, we removed a wall between the two rear bedrooms so the master would be next to the large walk-in closet. That closet became the master bath. As a result, we were able to build a new clothes closet. This also enabled us to annex some hallway space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Bathroom with blue walls, white tile, and glass shower door" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52113 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bathroom-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bathroom-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Rolling with the remodel process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though we love the end result of our new home in Brooklyn, the full home renovation process <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took a lot longer</a> than we had originally hoped. This was partly due to waiting for city permits, changes to our original plan, and the general busy schedule of our contractor. We were able to stay in our old apartment for some time because we had low carrying costs, and held off selling it as long as possible. When we finally put our old place on the market, it sold quickly and we moved into the new place with only a few weeks&#8217; notice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07.jpg" alt="Light blue bedroom with a striped bed sham and Florida poster" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52119 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">Our contractor&#8217;s team got it to a “move-in ready” state in time for our move, but we realized that our idea of move-in ready differed from theirs. The floors were dry enough to put our furniture down, but none of the kitchen appliances worked. We had one functioning toilet with the only working sink in the kitchen. B and I had an interesting experience making ramen with our coffee maker and eating tuna out of a pouch.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, that rough patch just made us appreciate our wonderful new kitchen and the whole apartment even more. And we still love all the little details that make this apartment uniquely ours.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Finally, a happy home after bumps and delays</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>For a dozen years, Tara and Mike lived in a tiny studio apartment on the Upper West Side. A move uptown, to the Grand Concourse Historic District of the Bronx, landed them in a much larger home in a 1930s co-op building. In 2015, they moved in and up against no deadlines to renovate, carefully thought through the changes they wanted to make and assembled photos and information that a contractor could use to bring their visions to life. Read on for the full story of how they gutted two full baths, enlarged closets (one of which now fits three bikes!), and lived to tell the tale of not one, but two, plumbing disasters.</em></p>

<em>Guest post by Bronx homeowner Tara</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We purchased this apartment a few years ago, after living in a 250-square-foot apartment on the West Side for about 12 years. Going from a studio apartment to a 3-bed, 2-bath was a big leap. The kitchen had already been renovated by the previous owners, so we only had to deal with the outdated bathrooms. Leaky toilets, hot water surges, and ugly yellow tile were just a few of the things we needed to remedy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We took our time in the beginning, even before <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/8457" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting our project to Sweeten</a>, to lay out exactly what we wanted room by room. We had a document with photos ready to hand to any contractor who we contacted. This made it easy for us and the contractor to make sure we were all on the same page from the start. We were also never in a rush to start the work. We started looking for a contractor at least four months before we were even ready to think about putting any money down. This gave us the luxury of taking our time to choose the firm that was right for us.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30669 size-full" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before05.jpg" alt="renovator Bronx" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before05-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
(Before) Master bath<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt04.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30668 mt-24 size-full" title="bath" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt04.gif" alt="renovator Bronx" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><br />
(Above) Master bath</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We ended up going with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten design-build firm</a>. We wanted a design-build firm from the start so that someone would take charge of sourcing and delivery of all the various components of our job. Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a> included line items for everything we could possibly need, and we were free to select the fixtures that fit within the budget. When something we wanted was out of range, we either decided to find an alternative or paid the difference upfront. We also needed someone who could handle all of the Department of Buildings permits, as well as our co-op’s application process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had a specific vision for this renovation. We planned to gut the bathrooms and add ceiling fans in all of the bedrooms and living room, new radiator covers in the bedrooms, and lighting and doors throughout. The bathroom in the master was very narrow, and we wanted to move the tub out of the guest bath and into the master. Moving the location of the tub, and expanding the bathroom by about two feet, solved the narrowness issue.</p>

(During) Master bath ceiling reveals a waste line wrapped in duct tape<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30673 mt-24 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06.jpg" alt="renovator Bronx" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>We really were excited to pick out all the new fixtures and tiles for the bathrooms. Our contractor offered several options within our budget. We wanted to see and touch the cabinets and faucets before committing to them. Our thinking was if we’re going to be living with these things for years to come, we needed to like how they felt, and more importantly, wanted to see the quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We visited several showrooms in the NYC area to see the Kohler line of cabinets and the Brizo faucets that we ultimately chose. We liked the Fantini sink faucet and shape of the handles for the guest bath; it also matched the black finish of the Brizo line used in the shower. To keep the ordering simple, we used the same family of fixtures and cabinets in both bathrooms, with different finishes for each.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We chose a fun feature as an accent in the shower: a round tile in shades of white, blue, and green from a company called Clayhaus in Oregon. Our biggest challenge was timing the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">special order and delivery</a> around the completion of the first bathroom. The tiles took about six weeks to fabricate, and we ended up being about two weeks off. Luckily, the crew had other projects around our apartment to complete while waiting for the tile to arrive.</p>

(After) Guest bath<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30674 mt-24 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt02.jpg" alt="renovator Bronx" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt02-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt02-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When our master bath ceiling was opened up during demolition, the contractor found that the waste line from the toilet above had been wrapped in duct tape during a prior renovation. We immediately reported this to building management, who arranged to have the pipe replaced. Their plumber worked with our contractor to gain access, and within a day the situation was resolved.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30677 size-full" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before03.jpg" alt="renovator Bronx" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before03-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30782 mb-0 size-full" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt14.jpg" alt="renovator Bronx" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt14-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt14-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enlarging the master bath with extra square footage resulted in an added benefit, giving us space in our bedroom to accommodate a large dresser next to the newly combined <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closets</a>.<br />
In the guest room, we widened the closet to make it suitable for bike storage. We can now get three bikes in there with room for other gear along the sides and floor.</p>

<p>During the renovation, we had no options for moving off-site, but having a contractor who understood our needs, and the fact that we would be <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living on site</a> the entire time, made the process bearable. The first few weeks of disruption were the hardest, but we settled into a routine and focused on the outcome. And because we were dealing with two bathrooms, we could only start the second one when the first was completed.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30682 size-full" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before02.jpg" alt="renovator Bronx" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt12.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30684 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt12.gif" alt="SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt12" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30683 mb-0 size-full" title="hallway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt10.jpg" alt="renovator Bronx" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt10-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While our own renovation went smoothly, with all pipes and fittings replaced and brought up to code, it was an external problem that delayed the final weeks of work. Nearing what would have been the end of the project, we came home to water pouring down from a bathtub located in the apartment two floors above us. An older pipe leading from the tub drain had eroded completely and detached from the waste line. Bath water had been spilling down for hours while we were at work. Our crew was not on site that day, and the unit above ours was vacant. With no one to report the leak, it was ours to deal with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That was the most devastating moment because we were so close to completion but now had to deal with the clean-up and dry-out of brand new walls and flooring. We put in a claim with our insurance carrier to cover the cost of the repairs, and wanted our team to do the work, since they were still on site, knew our building and our home. We could trust them to work unsupervised. They were willing to stick around and do this repair, but it was at least three months and multiple visits by an insurance adjuster before we could agree on a scope of work and monetary settlement. Luckily, both bathrooms were still usable and we made sure there was no mold growing between the walls. When all was said and done, both spaces were finished about ten months after the start date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to the start of the renovation, our biggest question was whether we would be able to find a reliable contractor. We would be trusting them with our home, our valuables, and our dog, for several months, day in and day out, while we were at work. We wondered if they would do the best job they were capable of, or would they cut corners? Would they stand by their work?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m happy to say that they went above and beyond our expectations, standing by us when we had a major leak that damaged a significant portion of their work. They also took excellent care of our home. Sweeten was a great resource, and knowing that they were there to assist us was valuable when going into a major renovation. I don’t think we would have had as easy of a time finding a solid and reliable contractor if we had not used Sweeten from the start.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Now you can have America’s-next-top-chef pro-style quality at home</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone" title="a chef's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Cara_Kitchen-Bathroom-11-723x487.jpg" alt="White galley kitchen with commercial style kitchen appliances" width="723" height="487" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><em> (Above)</em> Cara and Jared <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/before-after-cara-and-jareds-chelsea-kitchen-and-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/">kitchen renovation</a></span></p>
<p>When commercial appliances first appeared on the home kitchen scene some 20 years ago, they were the couture of cooking: beautiful, very expensive, and available only to a select few who could manage the price tag and installation. With the renaissance of home entertaining and the widespread popularity of cooking shows, manufacturers have answered the homeowners’ call for a commercial style that can easily fit into a new or renovated kitchen. Looks still lead the way, with shimmering stainless steel and sturdy controls. Function has kept up, too, thanks to improvements in cooking, cooling, and cleaning, to justify that price tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a><span> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Commercial Kitchen Ranges </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s much easier these days to purchase a commercial-style kitchen range for a home. You&#8217;ll find ranges that provide the function you seek, at a size and scale that fits into a home kitchen. Serious at-home chefs covet range features like cast-iron grates, stainless-steel surfaces, and quick-to-heat burners controlled by sizeable knobs. The controls with the <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DCS collection from Fisher &amp; Paykel</a> are illuminated, a safety feature that adds an extra touch of glamour.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another benefit of commercial-style kitchen ranges: they offer flexibility, which home cooks need. One such example is dual fuel, or ranges that feature a gas cooktop plus an electric oven. This provides the immediacy and control of a gas cooktop, with cooking power of up to 25,000 BTUs, and the precise performance of a true convection oven. Modern ranges also have digital panels that help you program correct temperature and cooking times to assure perfect results.</p>
<p>Before purchasing a commercial-style range, there are a few drawbacks you should consider. Some commercial-style kitchen range models have smaller oven cavities than their non-pro-style counterparts, so check the size to make it can handle your Thanksgiving turkey. The self-cleaning feature may also need to be sacrificed if that’s not important to you. Luckily, you’ll make it up in adjustable grates, cooktop grills, and superior simmering capabilities with flames that go as low as 140 degrees. Some brands have unique features. Thermador’s burners, in the shape of the company’s star emblem, disperse the flame heat to more evenly heat the entire surface of a pot. Fisher &amp; Paykel’s racking system allows the rack to extend as much as 75 percent outside the oven cavity, handy when removing a heavy dish, like a roast or a Dutch oven.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial Kitchen Refrigerators</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first commercial kitchen refrigerators to capture the imagination came with glass doors. It&#8217;s ideal for a professional kitchen, as many chefs working together simultaneously need to see what’s inside quickly and easily. For the home cook, <a href="https://true-residential.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">True Refrigeration</a> offers a stainless-framed glass door option reminiscent of that commercial version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another key feature of a commercial kitchen fridge is stainless steel. As an external material, it lends a pro-style touch. Also, some manufacturers, like True, offer stainless steel as an interior finish, too. Newer fridge models have black stainless steel for an extra touch of drama. Considering color? <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlueStar</a> claims to have more than 750 colors and finish combos to match its cooking products.</p>
<h4>Features inside the fridge</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What’s going on behind cool-looking doors is just as important to the home chef, who may shop once a week and needs all that food to stay fresh. Look for features like individual climate-controlled drawers, adjustable racking systems, and extra-large shelves to hold entertainment platters and pizzas. <a href="https://www.thermador.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thermador</a> has introduced removable bins on the fridge door that can be loaded with ingredients for meals during the week, then removed to the kitchen counter when it’s time to prep dinner.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial-style Dishwasher</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Real commercial dishwashers, perhaps surprisingly, lack all the features that homeowners have come to depend on. They basically serve to wash and sanitize, so you won’t find them with adjustable racking systems or garbage disposals. In fact, with a true pro version, you would have to thoroughly rinse the glasses and dishes before placing them in the washer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re set on a commercial-style, dishwasher, start with stainless steel. This sparkling metal says the appliance means business, just like its cooking and cooling counterparts described above. Hefty, architectural handles complete the pro-style effect (unless you prefer a look with controls hidden on the inside panel.) Inside, look for adaptable features like adjustable or removable racks and baskets. As for function, there’s plenty from popular manufacturers to make you happy, including a range of wash cycles, a timer, super-quiet operation, and a childproof lock. Want all the bells and whistles? Spring for a third rack from manufacturers like Bosch, or a built-in water softener from <a href="https://www.jennair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenn-Air</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial-Style Kitchen Faucets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The introduction of the pull-out <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-trends-kitchen-faucets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faucet</a> two decades ago forever changed our impression of this indispensable kitchen tool. Finally, with minimum effort (and splashing), you could spray the entire sink—as well as the inside of a pasta pot. Commercial-style kitchen faucets take this advantage a step further. Many offer single-handle operation, a higher-than-average arc, and a spray that can swivel 360 degrees. Look to plumbing experts like <a href="https://www.isenbergfaucets.com/kitchen/">Isenberg</a>, <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/kitchen-faucets/article/CNT125900008.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler</a>, and <a href="https://www.grohe.us/kitchen/kitchen-faucets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grohe</a> for more handy options. There are even options for foot control, for completely hands-free operation, like the pros enjoy. If you love sparkling water, Grohe also makes a pro-style faucet that puts fizz in your tap water when you want it.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peek inside a commercial kitchen and you’re likely to see stainless steel on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counter surfaces</a>. The sanitary, odor- and moisture-impervious benefits are obvious. However, dings and scratches become pretty obvious. If the patina of usage isn’t for you, check out natural or engineered stone. Professional chefs love it for the same reasons homeowners do: it can take heat without scorching, yet stays cool to the touch. Natural stones such as granite and marble will, nevertheless, show stains, so if you don’t want to risk marring the perfect surface, consider an engineered stone like <a href="https://www.dekton.com/usa/what-is-dekton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dekton</a> or <a href="https://www.caesarstoneus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caesarstone</a>, which claim to resist all liquids, including wine and juice.</p>
<h4>Creating a commercial-style kitchen at home</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning a kitchen renovation involves loads of decisions as you work your way through all the choices for appliances and materials. Commercial style kitchens, while at the higher end of the budget spectrum, remains a classic, and a trend with staying power, if you take the time to find those products that sync with your individual cooking style.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Shower systems offer spa-like luxury, from multi-functional showerheads to a steam shower and chromotherapy</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25648 size-chrono" title="shower systems" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg" alt="shower systems" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><em>(Above) Leslie&#8217;s renovation with Sweeten resulted in a separate room for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full shower system</a> including a steam shower, rain showerheads and jet sprays</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Americans have become highly sophisticated about their renovation choices and preferences. And nowhere is this more evident than in the bath. Homeowners count on their bathrooms to help them rev up in the morning and wind down in the evening. Manufacturers now create elaborate shower systems that provide a luxurious shower experience. Here, Sweeten&#8217;s guide to modern shower systems outlines popular features and add-ons, with tips on adding one into your bathroom remodel plans.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Design to go with the flow</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s begin with the layout. Shower systems should be isolated, almost like a room, and shouldn&#8217;t be part of a tub. While it doesn’t have to be big enough to fit two, there should be enough footage to move around and extend your arms fully. Simple materials and clean lines deliver the best aesthetic to convey a feeling of serenity. This means frameless glass doors and a floor-level shower tray. (Bonus: It’s fully accessible!) A built-in bench, particularly if the shower is clad in <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stone</a>, adds another luxurious touch. Make sure you assess your plumbing capacity to be sure it can supply sufficient volume pressure. Your water heater must also be ready if you include a steam shower or body jets. (These features often operate at the same time as the shower.) Ensure your contractor evaluates the drain so it evacuates all that water quickly. Next, you&#8217;ll want to plan your shower system features!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Luxury shower system options</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luxury shower systems in the home go way beyond simple showerheads, even one with diverse spray patterns. The typical luxury shower system is a combination of individual features that come as a unit in a panel, or those you choose individually. You&#8217;ll want a shower head with several spray patterns, a hand shower on a wall-mount slide bar, and several pairs of body jets (six to eight are common). This arrangement should come with a thermostatic diverter that controls the water temperature to a preset degree. This means you don’t have to fiddle with it each time you turn it on.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Shower panels</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a few hundred dollars, you can find an all-in-one shower panel at a box store such as Home Depot. (This is at least half of what you would spend on a shower system of individual components.) The panel includes a showerhead, two to eight body jets, and an adjustable hand shower. Advantageously, a shower panel provides quick installation at a price that fits most budgets. The disadvantage: the panel mounts to the wall, extending several inches into the shower space. If you want a sleeker look, you will need to go with individual components that recess into the wall. Either way, make sure that your plumbing provides sufficient water pressure for all the features to operate simultaneously. If not, your contractor should make adjustments before installation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rain shower heads</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An increasingly popular type of luxury shower head is the rain shower head. Rain shower heads are preferred for the soothing effect that its name indicates. These luxury-type shower heads can be mounted to the wall and angled to drop directly down, or installed on the ceiling. Look for an extra-wide spray span, as much as 15 inches, and a choice of spray patterns, from gentle to drenching. <a href="https://www.grohe.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grohe</a> and <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler</a> also offer digital controls with their rain shower systems. These controls allow you to preset your favorite spray pattern with your preferred water temperature. You simply push a button to start your shower and enter your specific experience. Kohler developed a showering panel that simulates the varying sizes and angles of raindrops as they fall, for a fully sensory occurrence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you really want to splurge, you can get a shower panel installed in the ceiling that will shower you with several spray patterns simultaneously. This requires special framing for the ceiling, so you need to plan this feature before you start your renovation.</p>

<h3>Body sprays</h3>
<p>These components allow for water therapy that hits every inch of your body to soothe or stimulate. Surface-mounted or recessed, the sprays are typically installed in pairs. Pay careful attention to placement, particularly if people of varying heights will use the shower. Swivel body sprays can help for minor adjustments. The top-level jets target the shoulders, the middle, the waist or hips, and the lowest, the thighs or knees. Some jets pop out when in operation, then retract when the water is turned off. You can find these sprays in the classic faucet and showerhead finishes—chrome, nickel, bronze, polished or brushed—and in square or round shapes from most major manufacturers including <a href="https://www.americanstandard-us.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Standard</a>, Kohler, <a href="https://www.hansgrohe-usa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hansgrohe</a>, Grohe, <a href="https://www.deltafaucet.com/bathroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delta</a>, and <a href="https://www.moen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moen</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Steam</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Technological advances have made it possible to bring the coveted spa experience of steam into modern homes. The operation appears simple: steam is emitted by heads installed on the shower wall, and operated by a control pad programmed for temperature and session length. However, you will need to plan with your contractor to allow for several precautions. Don&#8217;t forget: steam showers generate more moisture and heat than a regular shower. As a result, your contractor will first install vapor proofing material to prevent water vapor from seeping through the walls. The shower door should be airtight, too, so water doesn’t escape to create mildew on wallpaper and paint. The ceiling should be curved so that condensed vapor droplets run down the walls, instead of dripping on you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For operation, a steam shower requires a generator and a ventilation unit. Both of these features are concealed from sight. Accordingly, your contractor can help you to determine the best, most effective placement for each. Alternatively, you can buy a stand-alone steam shower, complete with rain shower, hand shower, massage jets, whirlpool tub, steam generator, and LED lighting. Companies that specialize in steam showers, as well as major manufacturers like Kohler or <a href="https://www.whirlpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whirlpool</a>, offer many choices. If you don&#8217;t want to go the custom route, a two-person unit will cost you about $2,000. If you are creating a custom steam shower, expect your costs to double, to about $4,000. For either route: work with a contractor to ensure properly-installed plumbing and electricity.</p>

<h4>Seating for shower systems</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When planning to introduce a steam shower to your bathroom, plan for it to be big enough for at least two people to use. Also, allow footage for a bench for lounging and even reclining.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Chromotherapy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know that humans crave the healing power of light based on our innate need for sunlight and full-spectrum light in wintertime. You can isolate the individual colors that make up full-spectrum for healing effects in the bath. This is called chromotherapy. You’ll want at least four <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lights</a> installed in your shower ceiling for even illumination. You can find LED versions in primary colors, and connect them to a separate switch in the shower. Amazon sells chromotherapy bulbs in seven colors—orange, red, blue, aqua, indigo, green, and yellow. You can change them at will, or set them to cycle through all the colors. Make sure your contractor adds a dimming capability. You can also choose a chromotherapy package made to go with a tub or steam shower enclosure from a manufacturer.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Adding music to your shower system</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once upon a time, you set your radio on the counter to listen to news and music. Kohler is among a handful of manufacturers that lets you bring music right into the shower. They offer a shower head with a wireless speaker that you can connect to your phone with Bluetooth® technology. The speaker docks in the center of the showerhead when in use, and is removable for recharging the battery, which lasts up to seven hours. The showerhead is available as a wall-mount or rain shower. Grohe also makes a rechargeable wireless speaker that attaches to the slide bar of the hand shower. For under $100, you can opt for wireless Bluetooth® speakers, compatible with most smartphones, that attach to the wall by suction cups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to the bathroom, it makes sense that your shower should provide the personalized experience you seek. By adding one or all of the features described above, you can luxuriate in your favorite spa rituals every day without leaving home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Map out your bathroom storage strategy, using a vanity, shelves, custom built-ins and secret niches</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20746 " title="bathroom storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #76808f;">Laura and Matthew&#8217;s double drawer</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall-hung vanity</a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">With all the fixtures taking up space in the bathroom—sinks, toilet, plus tub or shower—it can be hard to also fit sufficient storage. The vanity alone is rarely enough. And if your space is traditional, with a pedestal sink, the need is greater. However, with smart planning that addresses all the tasks in the bath, you can find the best bathroom storage solutions.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a><span> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Planning your space</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">First, figure out where the fixtures will go. If you’re remodeling, you need to decide if everything stays put or if something moves. Evaluate the floor and wall space to find areas for storage—bathroom cabinets, shelves, or freestanding pieces like furniture. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Bathroom vanity</b></span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Once a simple box with doors and drawers for storing toiletries, the vanity has expanded its capabilities. Manufacturers like <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler</a> and <a href="https://www.duravit.us/html/default/home.us-en.html#/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duravit</a> have introduced built-in internal storage compartments that corral items small, medium and large, while still remaining in arm’s reach. Look for helpful add-ons like electrical outlets, adjustable shelves, and rollout trays. For existing vanities, small acrylic trays and storage boxes at the <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/welcome.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Container Store</a> fit a variety of drawer dimensions. If the bathroom is shared, and you have room for twin vanities instead of one large one, go for it! This allows each occupant to organize the space exactly as he or she wishes. </span><span class="s1">You can identify the type of vanity you want from among the following styles:</span></p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Floating &#8211; This style, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attached to the wall</a>, keeps the floor clear for an open look. You can find models from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.decoracabinets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decorá</a> that include at least one drawer unde</span><span class="s3">r the sink. Expect a small cutout in the middle of the top drawer to clear the plumbing pipes, and still allow room on the left and right. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Freestanding &#8211; The advantage here is the vanity can be moved, with little impact on the wall behind it. It typically goes countertop to floor so there’s more square footage for storage and more door-and-drawer combos. <a class="" href="https://ronbow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ronbow</a> makes vanities with integrated sinks and storage below starting as narrow as 19 inches wide, good to fit twin sets in a small bath. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-laura-and-peters-uptown-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Console styles</a> closely resemble furniture, with shapely legs below the cabinet to create an open effect, and usually incorporate a shelf near the bottom.<br />
<b><br />
</b></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Built-in cabinets</b></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This might be custom cabinetry, similar to what you would order for the kitchen, and from many of the same manufacturers. Or it might be <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bespoke</a>, crafted by a carpenter. Because the unit is built into a wall, it can be as large and long as you want. It also allows the addition of matching units above the counter, on either side of the sink, or between double sinks. You get lots of opportunities to vary door, drawer, and open shelf combos above and below the counter. <a href="https://www.kraftmaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KraftMaid</a> makes a narrow pullout unit with shelves, much like a pantry, to make use of a narrow vertical space. Consider upper cabinets with glass doors as bathroom storage for towels and pretty toiletries in a spa-like display.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Freestanding cabinets</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Similar to kitchen solutions, you can add a cabinet or an open case fitted with shelves in any free space in the bath. Make sure there is clearance for any activity taking place nearby. The advantage here is that the shelves can be adjusted when you wish—to hold a hamper or bath towels on a lower shelf, and smaller personal care items at arm level. Another alternative: a shelf that is not a shelf, such as an étagère—an open-back shelving unit—or one side of a ladder. These repurposed bathroom storage ideas can be found at resale shops or some furniture stores that make small decorative furniture for the bath.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Built-in shelves</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-and-after-ellens-kensington-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shelves</a> maximize <span class="s1">vertical space anywhere there is an open wall space with studs that provide support for attaching the units. Find a place for shelves adjacent to a sink, between sinks, or flanking sinks, above a toilet tank, high up around the perimeter of the ceiling, on a wall a foot or so from the shower, or even a shallow ledge above the vanity. In addition to shelves that match a manufacturer’s vanity collection, options include a wide selection of widths and depths or you can have a carpenter craft shelves to exact specifications. As with vanities, they come in a variety of </span>styles.</p>
<p class="p1">The most versatile, these shelves go anywhere there is sufficient support to attach them: above the toilet, between sinks or flanking sinks, high up around the perimeter of the ceiling, or even a shallow ledge above the vanity.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21983 size-chrono" title="bathroom storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #76808f;">Melina and Fabio&#8217;s gold and marble</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-apartment-gets-dose-luxury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floating shelves</a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Medicine cabinets</strong></span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Why go for a simple mirror when you can capture storage above the sink too? You have two options for storage here, with medicine cabinets that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recess into a wall</a> or mount on the wall, each with the traditional mirrored door that opens out.<br />
<b><br />
*</b>Recessed &#8211; Placed in the shallow wall space between studs, this style comes in versions from 4 to 8 inches deep—big enough to stow rolls of toilet paper. Kohler offers one for less than $100. <a href="https://www.robern.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robern</a> adds options with one, two, or three doors as well as electrical outlets for added organization and versatility.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>*</b>Wall mount &#8211; If you mount the cabinet on the surface of the wall, check out Decorá, which makes a model with storage shelves that slide out from either side, disappearing when not in use.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-19471 size-chrono" title="bathroom storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a><span style="color: #76808f;">Maria and Eric&#8217;s</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-modern-gut-renovation-goes-scandinavian-chic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in niche</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Built-in niche</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This type of shelf is located in a recessed area, such as between studs or even between two cabinets. Built-ins also work on a smaller scale in the shower, in the form of a niche for shampoos and soaps. In the wall above the tub, you can go larger and perhaps fit a couple shelves for a practical display of bath salts and liquid soaps. For visual interest, insert mirrored panels or beadboard on the back surfaces of the niches, or paint them a contrasting color.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Furniture</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">In addition to the small decorative pieces described above, it can be fun to introduce a vintage dresser or bookcase, if you have the room. Use the top to display personal items as well as toiletries. Drawers hold towels, small appliances like a hair dryer or electric razor. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Solve your bathroom storage with some of the suggestions described above, and begin to enjoy the serene space you deserve.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">This Upper East Side apartment is now the perfect showcase for travel treasures and curated art collection</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18492" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/samantha-apartment.jpg" alt="apartment renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/samantha-apartment.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/samantha-apartment-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s dispatch comes from the interior designer of a New York City apartment re-do. Samantha was brought on to help modernize a client’s apartment, and while she was up for leading the ambitious design needs, she needed help finding a general contractor who could execute beautifully on the plans. Her client had filled his home with art and travel finds over the course of four decades in the space, and what started as a “refresh” project evolved into a total apartment renovation to create a light and bright canvas for treasured pieces and cherished friends. </span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Samantha Stein, Interior Designer</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stars aligned when a good friend put me in touch with a potential client I’d known for years. Ron, the homeowner, had been living in the same Upper East Side post-war apartment for 40 years (!) and was ready for some interior changes to freshen it up. We met to discuss priorities and a design vision, and then turned to Sweeten for help choosing a contractor for </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were able to use Sweeten’s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">network to narrow our contractor choice down to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1458#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one firm</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which was experienced and great to work with. They had a reasonable price for our initial wish list, and after we began working with them, we grew more comfortable expanding into more custom solutions and additional scope, for what would ultimately become a full gut renovation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, the theme of the renovation was a relatively minimal ‘refresh’ &#8211; new paint, strip and refinish floors, clean-up details such as the custom five inches of crown molding in the living room, add custom millwork covers for the old and dilapidated radiator units, and complete a full renovation of the very outdated kitchen.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron, the client, wavered back and forth about updating his traditional apartment into a more modern space with an open-concept living and kitchen area. Ultimately, however, his classical taste and the way he uses the apartment in his daily life led us to leaving an enclosed kitchen, but updating its finishes and changing a few details to make the whole living area feel larger and flow more seamlessly. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We removed both doors to the kitchen in favor of open entryways, demolished the two china cabinets that were edging into the dining space, and intended to continue the existing parquet into the kitchen. But, the more we discussed matching the existing parquet in rooms that had either outdated carpeting or badly damaged linoleum, the trickier it seemed it would be to get the clean, flowing feeling that Ron was looking for. After weighing costs and options with George&#8217;s team, we decided that going with a wide-plank engineered wood throughout the entire apartment (with the direction of the planks leading your eye out to the living room windows) was the right solution for a cohesive, flowing apartment. Ripping out the parquet allowed us to fully level and soundproof the subfloor, as well as fully waterproof the kitchen area. Great sighs of relief went up all around when the 40+ year old parquet and carpeting pieces were hauled out, and the textured wood floors (supplied by Glen Floors) look fantastic. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron has a fabulous lifelong collection of china, music, and incredible books on art, music, and travel that were hiding around the apartment. So, one of the top priorities for the renovation was storage. Curating a selected display of these items felt to me the best way to celebrate his travels and life experiences – they should be an integral part of the apartment without looking kitschy or messy. I had originally proposed a huge built-in wall of custom shelving and cabinetry, but pricey bids from other contractors made us step back. Once we started with George&#8217;s team, however, we felt confident we could bring back this concept to make up for the lost kitchen/dining storage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We drew inspiration from several interiors that featured shelving surrounding a ‘nook’ for the sofa, and Michael and Dennis were able to help us flawlessly execute this vision with a stunning custom piece. The weight of the real wood doors, soft-close hinges, adjustable shelving, and hardware we selected from Nassau Suffolk Hardware make it all fit in perfectly—it’s hard to believe it wasn’t there before. We added two brass sconces from Ralph Lauren Home to softly light the sofa area at night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18497 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03.jpg" alt="dark wood floors" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> </span><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18498" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04.jpg" alt="traditional dining table" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen was where the majority of the hard work happened. Our expert team was able to match my every demand. We re-centered the sink on the windows, removed a dropped ceiling section just above the windows, and gained upper cabinets by replacing the double wall ovens with a more conventional range. We saved a ton on appliances with some lucky timing with a big sale at Thermador, and chose a refrigerator, gas range, recirculating hood, and dishwasher from their Professional Series line. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The custom cabinets, again made from real wood, fit perfectly and are of incredible quality. We ordered the Kohler sink from Wayfair and the Rohl faucet from Nassau Suffolk Hardware. Our experts helped us choose Caesarstone quartz countertops instead of a pricier granite or marble, and we are impressed with their quality. Under-cabinet lighting and a few LEDs above the sink, in addition to the overhead fixture, make for lots of different ways to light the kitchen at night. The kitchen alone makes the entire apartment feel new and fresh, and its traditional accents (crown molding and the custom bevel on the countertops) keep it in the same design family as the rest of the apartment. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bedroom and living room, we carefully selected vintage rugs to soften the newly wood-clad floors. Custom millwork radiator covers with picture-frame molding and Caesarstone tops replaced falling-apart metal enclosures for the A/C and heaters under the windows. Each has a powder-coated metal grill inset into the top and they act as gorgeous shelves to display a few more curios. These new units alone make the apartment look so much better! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michael and Dennis also helped us outfit each of the seven closets in the apartment with custom shelving, so that we could reorganize all of Ron’s belongings to make more sense for his daily use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-18504 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11.jpg" alt="custom radiator millwork covers" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18505" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12.jpg" alt="traditional bedroom aesthetic" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were so happy with their work that toward the end of the project, we even decided to hit on a long term wish list item for Ron: a deep-soaking tub in the master bath, and brand new shower and sink hardware (all from Rohl through Gracious Homes) in both bathrooms!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18507 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="rohl shower faucets" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18508" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15.jpg" alt="large format white shower tiles" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the full renovation took a lot of hard work, energy, and time. Ron loves showing off his new space and everyone is thrilled with the results. We’re grateful to the team at Sweeten for matching us with George and his crew, who were dependable and creative. They were flexible enough to work with us to incorporate lots of changes on the fly, and helped make our initial fantasy vision into a tangible reality.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new baby for Lindsay and Matt would bring big changes for the couple, clearly. But one of those changes would mean leaving their cozy Park Slope walk-up to find more space and flexibility for their growing family. Committed to staying in Brooklyn, they purchased a promising co-op apartment in Ditmas Park, with hopes of converting their one-bedroom into a two while subtly upgrading a number of the uninspiring finishes in their kitchen and beyond. Read on for Lindsay’s take on their creative (and altogether pretty budget-friendly) home renovation! </span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-expert-paul/lindsay-and-matts-sweetened-brooklyn-coop-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20345 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Kitchen_Portrait-02-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Kitchen_Portrait-02-1-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Kitchen_Portrait-02-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Kitchen_Portrait-02-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Kitchen_Portrait-02-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Lindsay, Ditmas Park homeowner</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many New Yorkers, after Matt and I had a baby we started yearning for more (or at least a different kind of) space. We lived in a Park Slope brownstone walk-up, and while our apartment was full of charm, we realized it was going to become more and more difficult to live there as our daughter grew older with its stairs, open fireplaces, jagged floors, and somewhat awkward layout. So, we jumped on the real estate bandwagon, setting our sites on convertible one-bedroom apartments since two-bedroom co-ops were mostly out of our price range.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being outbid several times in Prospect Heights and Windsor Terrace, we eventually ended up in Ditmas Park, where Matt had previously lived and where we first met. There, we found a one-bedroom in a building constructed in 1941 with a ton of charm, including pointed arch doorways and an inset bookcase. Our future building was a co-op, and ours was a sponsor unit that had recently undergone a renovation including a new kitchen and bathroom. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18187" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-Before-04.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-Before-04" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-Before-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-Before-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the place was in pretty good shape, the major component of our renovation was to separate the single bedroom into a master bedroom and nursery. We debated over a few layouts and decided to demolish the closets, build a partition, and create a new door opening from the living room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an architectural historian and frequent reader of design blogs, I was familiar with Sweeten and the service they offered. With the baby, work, a long unfinished doctoral dissertation, and the seemingly unending closing process, I didn&#8217;t have much time to do the legwork to find contractors or figure out how to schedule things. When the contractor we selected dropped out for a bigger Manhattan project right before closing, we decided to </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our project with Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;who were great in helping us find someone else in a pinch. In the end, they matched us with a Sweeten general contractor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who was incredibly competent and quickly helped reduce my anxiety about the whole project. We had decided most of the big things, but he was great in helping us think through the smaller issues, such as where to put outlets and what kind of paint to choose.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By this time, our scope had also expanded a bit. In addition to some (unexpected) electrical work, we decided on a few aesthetic upgrades in the kitchen and bathroom, where the finishes were somewhat “cheap” and bland. We weren’t going for total transformations here. Just a handful of subtle upgrades to the existing decor that also aligned with our overall budget.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since our budget was pretty small, we aimed to get the most bang for our buck. In the kitchen, we replaced the laminate countertop with a quartz Caesarstone counter and installed a new stainless undermount sink and chrome faucet, white subway tile backsplash, and new ceiling lights.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bathroom, we replaced the pedestal sink with a more modern sink and vanity cabinet, added metal shelves, and installed new lights. These changes were small, but they made a huge difference in how the space looked and functioned. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, construction went very smoothly. We were staying in sublets, so Paul knew that the work needed to be done as soon as possible. Paul wrapped things up right on schedule and before we knew it, we lived there! It was a great first-time renovating experience and I&#8217;m definitely itching to take on the next project.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Laura uploaded seventeen “before” photos to her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten project post</a>, a few things were very clear: if you could look past the black-paint-encrusted kitchen cabinets and cracked purple bath tiles, these Aussie expats had the makings of a spacious apartment with oversized windows in one of Brooklyn’s loveliest little neighborhoods. But the home’s tight nooks made it hard to even get a clear “before” photo of any one room. The layout was segmented with lots of little walls and doors, the parquet flooring had long ago given way, and the bathroom was filled with miniaturized fixtures. With sights set on a summer wedding and juggling all of the budget demands that come with new homeownership, we introduced Laura and Matthew to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a> for a kitchen, bathroom, ceiling, and flooring renovation in their Clinton Hill co-op!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="laura-with-husband-on-chair" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48105 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-After-1.jpg" alt="laura posing with her husband on a chair in living room with hardwood floors and windows with black frames after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-After-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-After-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-After-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&#8220;This was definitely a dream on a budget and our contractor and his incredible team really made that happen! The Sweeten process and people were amazing and we really can&#8217;t thank them enough for all of their help. We are gearing up for 70 Australians to come to our wedding &#8211; SO SO excited to show them what we have created!&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; Laura, Brooklyn homeowner</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The plans were ambitious but clear: demolish the kitchen wall to unite the kitchen, dining, and living rooms, re-build cabinetry and replace all finishes, gut the bathroom, clear out popcorn ceilings, and redo the floors. The demolition would leave a support column in place and center entertaining and seating around a new island, all in an entirely upgraded space.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="hallway-and-bathroom-before-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48117 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-2.jpg" alt="two images of hallway with hardwood floors and small bathroom with pedastal sink and toilet before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> <img decoding="async" title="small-kitchen-before-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48116 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-1.jpg" alt="small kitchen with floating shelves and gas cooking range before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tired parquet flooring came up and warm wood planks went down in their place. The original kitchen cabinets appeared to have been painted many times over—when Laura and Matthew adopted them they were thick with black paint. The couple had put in long hours at Ikea to design new cabinets, and their contractor&#8217;s team did the heavy lifting to install double lines of cabinetry in dove gray with brushed brass pulls. A large island now separates the kitchen from the living room, while offering bar seating, plenty of table space for entertaining, and hidden storage underneath. Mismatched counters were replaced with striking butcher block, and the sink was swapped for a deep stainless version with a tall, elegant faucet. Laura and Matthew chose an ivory honeycomb backsplash with gray grout and upgraded appliances to sleek stainless steel.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Ohhh, look! There&#8217;s that iconic Clinton Hill Co-op kitchen window…!</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom had also presumably seen kinder days. The floor consisted of gray tiles accented with smaller black and white pieces arranged in an art deco pattern, providing plenty of creative inspiration to work with while maintaining a familiar color theme throughout the home.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s team removed the bathroom door and re-created the entry with a sliding track door—a huge space-saving move. Laura and Matthew chose stark all-white subway wall tiles lined with contrasting gray grout to replace the former lavender ones&#8211;many of them broken. The tub stayed with a glaze refresh and gained a large rain showerhead and new fixtures. The big surprise in the bathroom came in the form of a brightly lacquered red vanity, adding a serious punch of color and modernity. A double-sided mirrored medicine cabinet brings extra storage, and strip lighting was upgraded to a streamlined bulb set. The newly expanded vanity carves out just enough room for a simple two-piece white porcelain toilet.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s work in the bedroom was more cosmetic but equally transformative. The building&#8217;s corner beams and beautiful windows are the focal point now that the popcorn ceilings and parquet floors are gone!</p>

				<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Holly and Christian, finding a new home in their Greenwich Village neighborhood proved to be a daunting challenge in a super competitive market. A depressing two-bedroom co-op in a 1920s building seemed like a deal-breaker at first glance, until the couple realized an important truth about Manhattan real estate: there were things they could control and things they could not change. Their realtor pointed out that location and square footage could not be altered, but design and interior finishes were fair game. So, Holly and Christian decided to stick with the neighborhood they loved and dig in with a renovation in a space overlooked by other buyers because it needed so much work. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re back with Ellen and Ben, first time buyers in Brooklyn’s Kensington neighborhood and the duo behind one of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-ellen-bens-brooklyn-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our most favorite Sweetened black and white baths</a>. Thankfully, Ellen had two shots at creating the perfect bathroom oasis in her family&#8217;s two bed, two bath co-op &#8212; if she&#8217;d stopped with the master bath, we would have missed out on a whole new way to take a 1960s bathroom from particle board cabinetry and bland beige tile to all modern and all white gleam. Ellen and Ben hired <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Alan</a> to tackle their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3094" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second bathroom renovation</a>, modernize its features, and add a little custom storage that goes a long way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-and-after-ellens-kensington-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13480 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-00-COVER-B.png" alt="SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-00-COVER-B" width="600" height="409" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-00-COVER-B.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-00-COVER-B-300x205.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span id="more-13478"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of focusing on the various offenses of the original bath, Ellen took a singular approach to keeping the space as open and as bright as possible. With Alan&#8217;s help, the family decided to leave fixtures in their original locations and Ellen set off on the hunt for tile to replace the chunky beige wall tiles and mini cubed floor tiles that were the defining features of the room&#8217;s look and feel. Ellen also eyed the sink vanity as an opportunity to reclaim a bit of space. It&#8217;s not that the original vanity&#8217;s square footage was so hefty, but as the visual focal point, it jutted into the bathroom&#8217;s center and acted as an unnecessary extension of the wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13479" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1112.jpg" alt="IMG_1112" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1112.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1112-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ellen opted for round penny tile in a matte white finish and then went big with it, lining the floor, the tub, the mirror frame, and the walls in the same geometric finish. This much shiny penny tile might have been overwhelming, but the smooth matte finish and the surrounding light gray grout instead feel calming and add beautiful texture to the all-white approach. An unintended bonus of going exclusively white is that this bathroom is often filled with colorful children&#8217;s bath toys &#8211; an instant way to brighten the room and add real-life &#8220;accent&#8221;!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13481" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-01" width="600" height="878" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-01-205x300.jpg 205w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13482" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-02" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ellen and Ben went with a wall-mounted sink, foregoing a conventional vanity and under-cabinet storage. The minimalist basin leaves just enough room for narrow countertop display and a hanging towel rod, and Ellen added similarly stream-lined faucet features with a wall mount and single handle. The simplicity of all that white tile left room for some especially lovely details: Alan&#8217;s team designed the custom built-in shelving to stow supplies and framed the mirror with a a custom marble ledge. The warm wood from the shelves and the slim stone detailing is subtle but oh so eye-catching.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To reduce water usage and minimize cleaning and upkeep needs, Ellen chose a minimalist <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Dual-Flush-Toilets/article/CNT123600001.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dual-flush Kohler toilet</a>, skirted to conceal piping. A number of the fixtures came from <a href="https://plus.google.com/110060558462840975174?gl=us&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Park Slope Plumbing Supply</a>, including the rainwater shower head and family-friendly hand-shower addition. Alan also came through with an unexpected touch, recommending a new white entry door with a modern frosted-glass feature that lets light in without any exposure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This family&#8217;s second bath is second to none. Bravo to Ellen, Ben, and their expert team on a gorgeous renovation!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re back this week with a Brooklyn family of three to take a look at their complete bathroom renovation. Robyn and Alejandro took a personal approach to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/before-after-robyn-and-alejandros-columbia-waterfront-industrial-kitchen-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovating the kitchen</a> in their Columbia Waterfront District condo and continued the overhaul in the bathroom with a mix of classic materials and an unexpected pop of color in two unconventional places. Like the kitchen, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the bathroom was beyond salvageable</a> when they found the place. Serious damage included peeling walls and temporary storage that could not withstand the room&#8217;s moisture. This project was a true family affair on both sides: we sent <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a> to rip out the interior walls and replace all of the fixtures, and Paulina&#8217;s father, Andrzej, lent his considerable talents to help Robyn and Alejandro open up and modernize their bathroom with a trio of new tiles and a full set of whiz bang fixtures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-robyn-and-alejandros-brooklyn-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13608 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unnamed1.png" alt="Before &amp; After: Robyn and Alejandro’s Brooklyn Bathroom Renovation – Sweetened!" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unnamed1.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unnamed1-585x390.png 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unnamed1-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>&#8220;In all instances, Paulina came to the table with a small detail that ended up completely making the space work for us &#8211; just brilliant.”</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em><strong>&#8211; Robyn, Brooklyn homeowner</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-13598"></span>From the start, Robyn and Alejandro had a clear vision for an all-tile bathroom with frameless glass to separate the tub from the rest of the room without closing off the space. Initially, they assumed that a standard two-tile approach would be the way to go, but as the outdated bath was demolished and the space became a blank slate, they opted for a set of three different tiles in varying styles and materials and ran with a unique pop of powder blue for contrast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13604" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bathroom-before.jpg" alt="bathroom before" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bathroom-before.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bathroom-before-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Robyn chose beveled white porcelain subway tiles for the room&#8217;s upper half and incorporated Paulina&#8217;s suggestion to use natural stone tile to line the lower half. Large-format Carrera marble helps provide a transition from the crisp subway tile down to the grittier black cement hex tiles that Robyn chose for the floor and tub wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Robyn felt drawn to incorporating a powder blue sink &#8211; this <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Iron-Bell-Vessel--above-counter-or-wall-mount-bathroom-sink-with-glazed-underside/productDetail/Vessel-Sinks/417732.htm?skuId=383924&amp;brandId=1011754&amp;isSeachPage=true&amp;pageName=globalSearch&amp;hash=id%3Dfilters%26startIndex%3D40%26scrollTop%3D596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler Vapour Blue oval basin</a> is a little bit of a throwback in an otherwise modern space. To continue that theme, Paulina created a custom frame to line the recessed, mirrored medicine cabinet with the same color pop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13605" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Robyn's Bathroom 01" width="600" height="881" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-01-204x300.jpg 204w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13606" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Robyn's Bathroom 02" width="600" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-02-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Robyn and Alejandro surveyed friends and family members as they considered how to make the tub as functional as possible and the verdict seemed clear: a whirlpool tub would be an expensive luxury that would probably go un-used. Despite the well-intentioned warnings, the couple forged ahead with the <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Tea-for-Two-60-x-32-drop-in-whirlpool-with-reversible-drain-and-heater-without-trim/productDetail/Whirlpools/421977.htm?brandId=429646&amp;skuId=377900&amp;categoryId=429549&amp;hash=id%3Dfilters%26startIndex%3D20%26scrollTop%3D524" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler Tea-for-Two whirlpool tub</a> with reversible drains and a built-in heater. Happily, it has become a frequent and favorite personal retreat for each family member!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paulina and Albert designed and built the custom vanity with two roomy drawers (modeled in the same simple Shaker style they used for the kitchen cabinets) and topped it with a slim Carrera marble counter. To complete the look, Robyn went with a vintage-styled <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Artifacts-single-handle-bathroom-sink-faucet/productDetail/Sink-Faucets/870349.htm?brandId=999639&amp;categoryId=431602" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler Artifacts faucet</a> with a single lever handle and continued with a second set of polished <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/browse/bathroom-showering-tub-shower-faucets/_/N-2dulZ1z11u2i?brandNValue=4294877386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler Artifacts fixtures</a> for the shower as well as a polished chrome double swing-arm wall sconce light from <a href="https://www.rejuvenation.com/catalog/products/fords-mill-double-2-1-4in-pin-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rejuvenation</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13607" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Robyn's Bathroom 03" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Clinton Hill homeowner Diane moved into an apartment in a large, residential co-op on historic Clinton Avenue about a year and a half ago. Diane was no stranger to renovation and hoped to bring lessons learned from renovating a kitchen in a previous home to make the bathroom in her new home more functional and comfortable. The bathroom layout worked for Diane but the small space was in rough condition: large floor tiles covered the walls and were starting to loosen and crack. More importantly, Diane needed to adjust the height of most of the fixtures and add a few other touches around the room to customize the small space and make each element more comfortable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="full-bathroom-with-black-white-floor-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47969 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom.jpg" alt="small full bathroom with white wall tiles and pedastal sink with mirrored medicine cabinets and white and black floor tiles and toilet after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;My Sweeten contractors were so great &#8211; I could not have found a better contractor. Best experience I ever had.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Diane, Clinton Hill Homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I loved Diane&#8217;s no-nonsense approach to this project. After a series of &#8220;nightmare&#8221; interactions with independent contractors, and after two different contacts walked with Diane&#8217;s deposits, Diane <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project on Sweeten</a> with all of her bases covered: she had already purchased new fixtures and navigated her building&#8217;s renovation approval process &#8211; two huge time-savers. We matched Diane with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Sean</a> who brought in rave reviews for responsiveness, staying in touch with project updates, and carefully protecting Diane&#8217;s home while work was underway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To restore a bright, clean, and classic feel to the space, Diane turned to white subway tiles, an all-time Sweeten favorite for a crisp and easy-to-clean finish. As Sean&#8217;s team gutted the bath and cleared out layers of old tiles, Diane discovered<span id="more-11593"></span> an extra bonus; the work revealed two additional inches in the width and height of the room &#8211; a big win in a small bath!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="black-and-white-bathroom-floor-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47975 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-5.jpg" alt="white bathroom with pedastal sink and mirrored medicine cabinets and bathtub with grab bar and black and white floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-5-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-5-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Diane set out to find a taller sink and toilet, a cast iron tub for soaking, and a grab bar for the shower/tub. Diane selected a Toto sink and toilet; the toilet&#8217;s design conceals all of the pipe work and extends to the floor with a seamless surface that makes it extra easy to keep clean. The new sink provides a full six inches of counter surface area behind the Toto faucet, putting daily items well within reach. Diane looked far and wide for a tub with relatively petite dimensions and found a gorgeous Porcher tub that fit the bill. Sean&#8217;s team customized the tub installation with tile work and a bench.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="full-bathroom-with-black-white-floor-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47969 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom.jpg" alt="small full bathroom with white wall tiles and pedastal sink with mirrored medicine cabinets and white and black floor tiles and toilet after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="bathtub-with-grab-bar" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47974 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-4.jpg" alt="bathtub with white wall tiles and grab bar and brushed nickel fixtures after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With such a sleek and classic finish, it&#8217;s hard to picture the major showstopper that Sean&#8217;s team expertly handled in the middle of the project. Because Diane had done so much prep work with her co-op board and already had all of the materials on site, Sean was ready to knock out the work in less than two weeks. A few days in, Sean discovered that the building&#8217;s stack of galvanized steel pipes behind the bathroom wall was corroded and rotting. Sean and team jumped in to manage the unexpected issue with Diane and the building&#8217;s management and got the project back on track in three days.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re delighted that Sean and Diane made such a great team. These photos speak for themselves in showing how smart design and carefully selected materials can make a space more comfortable &#8211; we&#8217;re so glad we were able to introduce Diane to such a capable and considerate team! Thank you, Diane, for showing us around your new bath!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">This is certainly one of those renovations that I have been anticipating with bated breath. Partly because the amazing homeowners, Kyle, an IT professional at a law firm, and Angela, a freelance illustrator, have the style and the je ne sais quoi to totally charm; but also, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I love projects like this one</a>, where the homeowners have lived in the space, dreamed about what it will be one day, and saved up for years towards the goal of making that dream home their real home. It gives all of us who may still be far from that goal, a sense of possibility.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brooklyn-apartment-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10714 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/01B_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="515" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/01B_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/01B_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x258.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;We&#8217;d been living here for eleven years and things were starting to get a bit shabby. When we moved in, the apartment had been freshly renovated with all the cheapest materials available at Home Depot, which was fine back then, but we really wanted to make it &#8216;ours.&#8217; We saved up for renovations all the while and put a lot of thought into what we wanted to do.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;"> &#8211;Angela, homeowner</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">When the time had arrived early this year, Kyle and Angela (and their &#8220;mean, little chihuahua&#8221;) posted to Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to get started on renovating</a> their 900 sq/ft, 2 bedroom Clinton Hill co-op apartment. The road to selecting &#8216;the perfect contractor&#8217; was made a whole lot sweeter by our three suggestions; according to Angela, “we feel confident that any of the contractors Sweeten selected for us would have done a great job, but we&#8217;re really happy that we chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Kris</a>.&#8221; Kris and his team were able to take the homeowners&#8217; dreams of extra counter space for baking and a place that showed off their personal mid-century style, and turn them into a reality, on-time and within-budget!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10715 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/02_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/02_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/02_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10716 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/03_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/03_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/03_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10717 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/04_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/04_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/04_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Kris&#8217; team worked closely with Kyle and Angela to meet their main objectives for the project: to create a modern, open apartment AND stay on budget. First order of business was making the &#8216;big moves,&#8217; which meant tearing down the non-structural interior walls and tearing up the outdated and damaged parquet flooring. With just these changes, the homeowners could already begin to anticipate their moment of, “I can hardly believe it&#8217;s the same place we&#8217;ve lived for the past decade!”<span id="more-10713"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10718 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/05_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/05_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/05_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10720 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/07_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/07_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/07_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">What I love about Kris and his team is that, not only are they exceptional at getting the work done well and on-time, but their custom millwork is always so impressive! They worked with Kyle and Angela&#8217;s mid-century modern aesthetic and came up with this gorgeous walnut custom cabinet system that I assure you will never wear out, but only wear in, as this lucky couple grows into their space. For their backsplash, the homeowners went bold with a bright green mosaic tile, <a href="https://www.mosaichse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R&#8217;ceef 5 in lime green</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Along with opening the kitchen came operation living-room-update-and-integrate. This meant that although that rich orangey/yellowish wall color is one of beauty, it needed to be refreshed and made more current with a clean, modern white. Underfoot, the old parquets were replaced throughout with new flooring in unstained white oak.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10721 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10722 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/09_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/09_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/09_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10723 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Although transitioning to a more modern aesthetic, Kyle and Angela wanted to keep a vintage vibe pulsing through their new space. The couple mixed mid-century based furniture, including a set of classic <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eames molded plastic/wire dining chairs</a>, a pair of vintage Heywood-Wakefield side tables, and a period-inspired <a href="https://www.radiusstore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elite Four walnut credenza</a> by Radius Innovative Design, with more current pieces like their <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble and stainless steel portica table</a> from Room &amp; Board.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10724 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">One of the best parts of tracking home renovations is seeing how people choose to highlight the art and objects that make up their personal collection. Throughout Kyle and Angela&#8217;s living area, the couple showcases their very impressive collection of prints by California-based artist, <a href="https://www.shag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shag</a>, and mid-century album covers by illustrator <a href="https://www.jimflora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jim Flora</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10725 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Over the dining table, they were able to bring some of that green from their backsplash out of the kitchen in another retro accent, <a href="https://www.rejuvenation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rejuvenation&#8217;s Astron Tri chandelier</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10727 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Kyle and Angela could not have been more excited to finally be rid of the outdated (Home Depot-centric) bathroom decor that they had come to love to hate (scroll to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see it here</a>), in exchange for their bright new, modern and material-rich space. The deep soaking tub from Kohler is cloaked, like the walls, in super white subway tile, and floating beside it is a dark oak Fresca Vanity with Versa faucet, both from <a href="https://www.decorplanet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decor Planet</a>. I personally love the texture that the carrera marble tiled floor adds to this sleek space.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10726 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">All in all, this home looks great and I can&#8217;t get enough of the true personality inside. Many thanks and congrats to the happy homeowners, Angela and Kyle! Also, big thanks to Sweeten Expert Kris, Natalia, and the rest of the team for the excellent work in making this home a whole lot sweeter!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">Last month, we shared the first-hand renovation</span> <a href="/2013/07/25/homeowner-guest-post-lisas-kitchen-renovation-pt-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story of Lisa Law</a><span style="color: #000000;">, a Brooklyn Heights homeowner who used theSweeten to update her crumbling kitchen, and today, we&#8217;re excited to share our 2nd homeowner guest post &#8212; coincidentally, this story also comes from a Brooklyn homeowner named Lisa who used theSweeten to renovate her kitchen! Lisa B., who works in the architecture &amp; interiors industry, and her husband Brian, a media studies professor &amp; author, had lived in their Kensington apartment for 8 years before taking the leap to renovate their kitchen. The couple</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted to Sweeten</a><span style="color: #000000;"> were matched with a Sweeten general contractor</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Today we have before &amp; afters of the transformed kitchen, along with Lisa&#8217;s insightful narrative on the new design and the process of making it happen.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9736 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/00b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-copy.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="256" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/00b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-copy.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/00b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-copy-300x128.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before renovating, our kitchen had its original, 1960s pine cabinets that were custom-built for the space, but had many layers of bad paint jobs and several of the doors didn&#8217;t close. We thought about trying to save them, but they were so solidly built that there was no way to cut them down to fit our new design plan. Plus, stripping all that paint off would have been a nightmare. The vinyl flooring was peeling, the wall oven didn&#8217;t work, the cooktop was barely functional and it was almost impossible to see what you were cooking since it was stuck in a corner under a metal hood. The countertops were horrible, fake woodgrain formica. When we first moved in, they were even worse &#8212; there was contact paper on them, which we were able to pull up, but we were disappointed with what we uncovered!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We needed a gut renovation! Everything had to go, down to the studs, which meant new drywall, ceilings, cabinets, fixtures, appliances, flooring, backsplash and lighting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9662 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-225x300.png 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I read about Sweeten a while ago in NYMag and kept it in the back of my mind because I knew we were going to renovate our kitchen. Although I worked in the interior design field, most of the contractors I knew were doing high-end renovations in Manhattan. I posted before pictures of my kitchen on the site and Sweeten introduced me via email to three contractors, all of whom I met with and who gave me estimates. They all seemed good, but as someone who knows about renovation, I appreciated that our contractor took extra time to really look at the kitchen, open up the cabinets, anticipate potential problems, and talk in depth about the process.<span id="more-9660"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9663 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="904" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-199x300.png 199w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-597x900.png 597w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Design / Style</strong></span></em>: Having worked as a design assistant for an architectural interior design firm, I got to see a lot of custom kitchens being made, usually with white millwork and cabinetry, which I really like &#8211; it&#8217;s clean and timeless.  I learned about a lot of interesting materials and fixtures, too, and my style leans towards a mix of mid-century modern and contemporary &#8212; definitely not ultra-modern.  Even though the building was built in 1961, the apartment has some nice, almost mid-century modern, details: a curved hallway soffit, hardwood floors, baseboard moldings, and a really neat custom pantry closet with separate compartments.  I wanted the kitchen to fit the era of the apartment and the building, but still be updated. I knew that I wanted high gloss, white cabinets and appliances in order to create a feeling of space, plus they are so much easier to clean.  The kitchen is small, so having simple lines and using materials in a way that make the space feel bigger were key factors in the design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m not afraid of dark or saturated colors, but you have to know how to use them. Using the dark navy color on the back wall was yet another way to create the illusion of space by making that wall disappear, or recede, into the background.  You also need to consider the light in the space when choosing a wall color, and sometimes the right color can be almost counter-intuitive.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s always difficult to do a gut renovation in an apartment. Living in a construction zone is messy and stressful, although Nick&#8217;s team did their best to keep the dust and debris to a minimum.  Of course, budget was a challenge. You have to think about what to spend your money on to get the most bang for your buck.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Flooring</strong></span></em>: I was so tempted to spend a lot on the flooring, but in a small space, it&#8217;s often not really worth it.  I decided on porcelain tile because of price point and durability, but finding one was tricky; there weren&#8217;t a lot of color options that would compliment my countertops, which I had already picked out. I finally found an Italian porcelain, which wasn&#8217;t expensive; I used a big 12&#8243; x 24&#8243; tile in a staggered brick pattern laid horizontally to give the illusion of width.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Cabinets</strong></span></em>: I knew that I wanted to buy the cabinets from Ikea, which is a great, budget-friendly, option. They are really well-made &#8212; much better than cabinets from the big box stores and even sometimes better than the ones you can get from custom cabinet dealers. Planning a kitchen from scratch is a challenge, and if you are buying cabinets from Ikea, you really need to have a good idea of what you want before you order, especially since the cabinets only come in a limited range of sizes. The designers there are helpful, but only up to a certain point. I had to think a lot about the functionality of the space, the flow, and the most efficient way to store everything. It helps to have a contractor who has installed Ikea cabinets before, and Nick knew what to expect. Nick was also great at coming up with custom solutions &#8212; when the new cabinets didn&#8217;t fit exactly how we wanted them, he created a modified, open cabinet so that we would still get the added storage. He also built a very sleek, custom radiator cover which can be easily removed to get to the radiator, if necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Appliances</strong></span></em>: Because it&#8217;s a small kitchen, I also needed to think about things like appliance door clearance &#8212; we wanted an integrated dishwasher next to the sink, and had to figure out where was best to install it in order to keep from disrupting the flow in the kitchen. Even figuring out which way the cabinet doors would open was important to plan out ahead of time.  Finding a counter-depth, 32&#8243; wide refrigerator in a smooth white finish was also a challenge. Europeans have the leg up on American manufacturers when it comes to smaller, apartment size appliances.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The project needed a high level of skill and creative thinking to accomplish what looks quite simple. We created a truly wonderful interior environment with high-end finishes that the client completely loves.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">-Bob Reid, tS member &amp; owner of ReidBuild</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This week we&#8217;re on Madison Ave. with new tS member <a href="https://sweeten.com/2301" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReidBuild</a>, for a close up look at their <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-end, Brazilian-inspired condo renovation</a>. Despite this apartment&#8217;s beautiful Central Park views, the space had its share of challenges to address in the renovation &#8212;  in general, the apartment lacked any charm or style, and, after being originally built in the 80&#8217;s, no updates had been made to it since. When it came to constructing the new design, the old framing system did not allow for the new electrical and plumbing lines, so the ReidBuild team took all the walls out and built them back new. After 14 months of construction, the 3-bed, 3-bath apartment embraced its sophisticated new style.<span id="more-9607"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9612 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg" alt="high-end-renovation-reidbuild" width="600" height="661" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation-272x300.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new home is light and open, with a beachy palette of bright whites and sea greens. The Brazilian-inspired design and style comes from the client and architect, both are from San Paulo, Brazil. Here in the dining room, the city skyline is on full display through large windows and reflected in an oversized, 12&#8242; x 7.5&#8242;  chrome-frame, mirrored glass barn door on industrial hardware, by <a href="https://www.bartelsdoors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bartels</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9613" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg" alt="03_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison Ave Renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The adjacent living room features custom white satin lacquer millwork for the entertainment unit, AC covers, bookcase and baseboards, as well as an integrated sound system. The living room, dinning room, kitchen and hallway are all painted with <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/redirects/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=oc-117&#038;">Benjamin Moore&#8217;s Simply White</a>, to create a beautiful contrast with the custom, hand scraped black oak floors by <a href="https://www.lvwood.com/">LV Wood</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9615 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg" alt="high-end-renovation-reidbuild" width="600" height="901" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation-599x900.jpg 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love the kitchen&#8217;s simple and very graceful style. Here, ReidBuild carefully installed new custom-built, white cabinets by Brazilian company Florense, as well as very fragile, white back painted, glass countertops by <a href="https://zeccaglass.com/">Zecca Glass</a>. Other modern touches include a gas stovetop from <a href="https://www.mieleusa.com/domestic/cooking-classes-3721.htm">Miele&#8217;s Hexa Design Series</a> and <a href="https://www.dornbracht.com/us/en-US/Products.aspx?view=list&#038;Series=Tara+Classic&#038;preferredItem=D883667EDB5D4CEA87F94330EC911FF3">Dornbracht&#8217;s Tara Classic Faucet</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The new master bedroom gets lots of natural light during the day, making the Luton electric blackout shades (used throughout the apartment) a necessary accessory. The bedroom&#8217;s muted tones and soft touches &#8212; fabric wall treatments, satin finish cabinets, and beautiful wool carpeting by Einstein Moomly &#8212; make it the perfect place to relax and recharge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9617 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/07_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg" alt="high-end-renovation-reidbuild" width="600" height="921" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/07_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/07_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation-195x300.jpg 195w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/07_theSweeten_Reidbuild_Madison-Ave-Renovation-586x900.jpg 586w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
Each of the home&#8217;s 3 bathrooms feature Thasos slab marble surfaces by <a href="https://www.davincistoneinc.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DaVinci Stone</a>, and classically-designed fixtures. The faucet above is <a href="https://uk.lefroybrooks.com/products/lb-1220/">Lefroy Brooks classic three hole basin mixer</a> with a <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Vintage-under-mount-bathroom-sink/productDetail/Under-mount-Sinks/417525.htm?brandId=651412&amp;skuId=357750&amp;categoryId=651399&amp;page=catProductDetails&amp;hash=id%3Dfilters%26startIndex%3D20%26scrollTop%3D0">Kohler Vintage under-mount sink</a>. The glass shower enclosure, white glass counter and wall are by Zecca Glass.</p>

In the new guest room, walls are painted custom color which reminds us of a day at the beach. It also features custom built-in wall niches with mirrored backs, which add to the lightness of the space.</p>
