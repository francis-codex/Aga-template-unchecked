<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Deck-1000-res.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="outdoor-swimming-pool-brown-deck" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Deck-1000-res-723x480.jpg" class="mb-10" alt="outdoor swimming pool and brown deck area with furniture after renovation" width="723" height="480" /></a><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Outdoor kitchen renovation by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Dennis</a></span></p>
<p>If you agree that the kitchen is the heart of the home, then consider bringing that sense of entertaining and relaxation outside with an outdoor kitchen. The options for an outdoor kitchen are endless—sinks, fridges, lighting, roofing, the list goes on.</p>
<p>If this sounds appealing, then you are not alone! More than 70 percent of homeowners who have outdoor space are looking to enhance the patio with the goal of making it more relaxing, according to a recent survey from American Home Furnishing Alliance. A CNN Money survey predicted the outdoor kitchen market to be worth almost $6 billion yearly.</p>
<p>An outdoor kitchen might become the cherry on top of your home renovation plans. It isn’t the cheapest project, nor a necessity, but <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines what you need to know to help you weigh your decision. Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</p>
<h3>How to schedule your outdoor kitchen project</h3>
<p>Luckily, it&#8217;s possible to do outdoor work at nearly any time of the year. However, weather with temperatures above freezing (minus rain and snow!) is preferred. On average, the shortest timeframe to complete an outdoor kitchen without delays or unforeseen events is 2-3 weeks. The longest average timeframe for an outdoor kitchen completion is four months. Start the process at least six months before you want to have the outdoor kitchen completed which also leaves enough time to create a good kitchen plan, advises Dennis, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten general contractor</a> in Philadelphia.</p>
<h3>How much does an outdoor kitchen cost?</h3>
<p>Like all home renovation projects, it’s best to determine what you want to spend in the beginning. Your budget will be a meeting place of your financial abilities and what you need and want. Dennis has worked on outdoor kitchens in the Philadelphia area that range in price from $15,000 to more than $100,000, which is a similar price range given by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6576#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jose, a Sweeten general contractor</a> in the Miami area.</p>
<p>A lower-budget outdoor kitchen will use materials such as concrete or cement pavers for the floor, according to New York City <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Santi</a>. Pressure-treated wood for cabinetry is also another good value choice. Materials in a more expensive outdoor kitchen could be stainless steel cabinets, stone floors, and a natural stone countertop, Santi said.</p>
<p>Appliances will also take up a big chunk of the budget. Jose said you should expect to pay several thousand dollars for a grill, fridge, and other appliances that are tough enough to survive the great outdoors.</p>
<p>The national average cost of a mid-range backyard patio that includes a fire pit, small fridge, sink, gas grill, lighting, a pergola, and a 20-foot square patio on flat ground is about $56,000, according to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs Value</a> report. That renovation will add over $30,000 to your home’s value. Many outdoor kitchens will start with a patio or deck that is already there, potentially bringing down the cost, according to Dennis.</p>
<h3>Design ideas for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>The layout of your outdoor kitchen can be drawn up by a kitchen designer or in a growing number of cases, a landscaper, says Dennis. Landscapers help to blend the outdoor kitchen into the overall look of your outdoor space. And of course, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your general contractor can likely assist</a> you with the design.</p>
<p>Consider where you place the grill, sink, and fridge as they create the “work triangle” for whoever is cooking. Be sure to keep that area free of obstructions or foot traffic. The design is also an important time to look at the strength of your deck if you are not starting from scratch. Dennis advises that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">existing decks will need to be assessed</a> to determine if they can handle the added weight.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="stone-counter-granite-countertop" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45766 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg" alt="stone counter and granite countertop for outdoor kitchen after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Outdoor kitchen renovation by New York <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4277#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor John</a></span></p>
<h3>Materials used in outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>With the outdoor factor, the materials used will differ greatly from your indoor kitchen. And then factor in your style preference and budget. If a bench—a single permanent structure that encompasses countertop, storage, and appliances—is part of your design, common materials are stucco, concrete, or stacked stone, says Dennis. Quartz is also a possibility, according to Jose.</p>
<p>When it comes to cabinets, don’t install too many as you’re not going to keep a lot of plates, pots, and pans in your outdoor kitchen. Whatever you do have should be able to stand up to the winter cold and that includes pipes that drain easily for winterizing.</p>
<h3>Common outdoor kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>The staple piece of your outdoor kitchen, and likely the most expensive, is the grill. If you’re planning on installing this permanently by building it into a bench, then don’t hold back on price, Dennis advised. “You want to make sure you have a quality grill—and fridge—because if they break you aren’t going to find one that is an exact fit for the permanent structure,” he said.</p>
<p>Whether your chosen grill will use a propane tank or rely on gas lines, it will have a big impact on your budget, timelines, and permits needed. Even though you&#8217;ll need to replace a tank, you won&#8217;t need gas lines from house to patio; which saves time, money, and effort.</p>
<p>Ironically, not all fridges can withstand the winter. “Some fridges cannot handle freezing weather even though that seems odd,” Dennis said. Outdoor fridges must work harder to maintain a constant temperature when the weather fluctuates. Consider high-grade stainless steel, which will reduce rust.  But don’t forget the added convenience of an outdoor fridge comes with the inconvenience of needing electricity. This will set you back a few hundred dollars, but solar energy is a possibility.</p>
<h3>Coverings for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Providing shade and shelter from the rain comes in many forms. For more extravagant outside kitchens—such as a TV for watching sports and a sound system—Dennis recommends something similar to a gazebo roof that has full coverage. There’s also lattice, which will provide some shade, but not rain cover. On the lower end of the budget scale is a retractable awning.</p>
<h3>Lighting for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Have a long think about what you will use your new outdoor space for. Will you be reading? Playing cards with friends at night? Then perhaps you need more lighting over the seating area as well as where you prepare the food.</p>
<p>Hosting dinner parties? Then consider more ambient lighting that highlights architecture. And if you’re already planning on having a fridge and the electricity it needs, the lighting might be a natural progression.</p>
<h3>Plumbing for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>Running water is important for cooking, so prepare to lay some pipes from your house to your outdoor kitchen. Depending upon the distance, it could cost between $600 to $1,500, according to Sweeten contractor Jose. Cold water is the only necessity here, but “if a client really wants hot water, we can explore a really small, tankless water heater,” he said.</p>
<p>Once you get the water out there, you then have to get rid of it. “You can’t put the waste water into the ground,” said Jose, “It needs to be connected back into the house’s sewer.” Use of a <a href="https://homesteady.com/info-12182622-can-use-dry-well-outdoor-sink.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dry well,</a> where water is filtered before going into the ground, might be possible, but this will depend on building codes.</p>
<h3>Tip: Prepare for permits</h3>
<p>The permitting process for outdoor kitchens can be surprisingly complicated. Not only will you need a building permit, but also an electrical permit for refrigeration. If you don’t want to use gas tank lighting, you’ll need mechanical or plumbing permits for water and gas. To avoid gas or electricity permits, clients can use a gas cylinder for the grill and solar energy for electricity, Sweeten contractor Santi suggested.</p>
<p>You may need approval from a zoning department. Dennis advises homeowners to check their local zoning codes as there may be limits on how much land you can cover with materials like concrete because rain cannot easily soak through it. There may also be restrictions on how close to the property line you can build. “It would be a waste of time to design something gorgeous and then submit it and not have it approved,” Dennis said.</p>

			<h3>An overview of how to start planning for your outdoor remodel</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50622" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg" alt="Outdoor remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Sprucing up the out-of-doors</h3>
<p class="p1">Whether your outdoor space is seasonal or livable all year-round, having an exterior spot to relax is an upgrade in lifestyle and property value. You may be wondering how to make the most out of a rooftop deck or an urban backyard. Preparing for an outdoor remodel has many moving parts—some projects more complex than others. We break down how to begin planning and share a timeline so your green space can be ready by summertime.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>Decide on your outdoor space plan</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Santi, the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a> who transformed <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-expert-santiago/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K.V.’s backyard</a>, shared the following advice with us: “Just like any other project around the house, I recommend taking some time to decide what your goal is” for your outdoor space. Will you be using the space primarily for dining, grilling, gardening, or play? Decide what you want to prioritize: functionality or ornamentation. If there are kids involved, that will be a determining factor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Turning her attention to her brownstone’s backyard, K.V. knew she wanted to use the space to host friends and barbecues. She took inspiration from gardens in Mexico and Brazil, leaning toward a more tropical atmosphere. A tall cedar fence to provide privacy was a must-have.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31799 size-full" title="blue-floor-tiles-terrace-space" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg" alt="blue floor tiles in a terrace space with outdoor furniture and blue door after renovation" width="1000" height="649" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck-300x195.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck-600x389.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michelle and Nate remodeled <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their rooftop deck</a> to double as a &#8220;bonus room&#8221; for hanging out. It was outfitted with comfortable seating and plants to make it feel cozy. However, the rooftop felt open and exposed, so a visual barrier of plantings was placed along the perimeter. The couple also brought in a fire pit for chilly, late-summer nights.</p>
<h3>Be flexible with material choices</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">K.V. had her heart set on bluestone to create a walkway to the elevated patio in her backyard. “She had a budget she didn’t want to go over,&#8221; Santi said. &#8220;She asked us to price out bluestone, but it was a little too high, so we looked for other materials.&#8221; He added, “Homeowners should always price projects with different materials [because] changing the materials doesn’t mean changing the final goal or look of the design.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a surprise twist, they discovered bluestone buried under the dirt in the yard during demolition. K.V.&#8217;s backyard remodel paved the ground with gravel, pavers, and bluestone. While a budget might limit some choices, your contractor may be able to suggest alternative materials that fit the budget and achieve the look you want.</p>
<h3>Choosing plants for color, texture, and to enhance privacy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We asked Justin, a horticulturist at <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costa Farms</a>, to fill us in on how to choose the right plants. “The first and most important thing is to get a realistic sense of your area’s growing conditions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Consider the sun, moisture, and exposure to wind, and then pick plants that like or at least tolerate what your space has to offer.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those sunny spots, Justin recommends heat-loving tropical plants, such as hibiscus, mandevilla, and allamanda. In shady areas, birds of paradise and majesty palm are perfect for adding drama. Croton and colorful aglaonema provide a pop of color. If you choose plants that won’t survive the winter, keep them in a pot so you can bring them indoors when temperatures drop.</p>
<p>Nate and Michelle turned to landscaping to soften their space. Their landscape designer proposed lavender and feather reed grass to frame the seating area and a Japanese Maple tree. Justin also suggests other tall plants, like arborvitae, columnar juniper, and yew for privacy.</p>
<p>In K.V.’s yard, Santi filled in the spotty grass with fresh sod to transform the lawn into a thick green carpet. He also added a row of mulch along one wall for a small but manageable garden. Potted plants fill out the patio and walkway, providing color and texture.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32859 size-full" title="outdoor-plants-images" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace.jpg" alt="outdoor plants images" width="1000" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace-300x300.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />

<h3>Choose low-maintenance plants and automated irrigation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors, New Yorkers prefer outdoor spaces that are low maintenance. A landscape plan with a three-season oasis, automated irrigation in the morning, flowering shrubs during the day, and accent lights illuminating trees and fences at night would be ideal. If you find yourself unlucky in plant-love, Justin has some advice: “Coleus is a fun choice that thrives in sun or shade and has delightful, dramatically colored foliage you can enjoy from spring to frost.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Similarly, consider sweet potato vine: It spills down over the side of a planter, creating an elegant look. It also grows as a groundcover or can be trained to grow up a trellis or other structure,&#8221; Justin said. &#8220;Torenia, also called wishbone flower, is another option you can grow in sun or shade.” And if watering is your biggest concern, he advises planting mandevilla, lantana, angelonia, purslane, and evolvulus.</p>
<p class="p1">For the renovation, your landscape design should be set before demolition begins, said NYC-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5301#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Shenna</a>. “The design will determine where plumbing and electrical lines are run, as well as the rough-in for the sprinkler system,” she said. “These are laid down right after demolition.” However, there&#8217;s time with final landscaping choices. They get planted around the last month or so of the project.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>Plan your outdoor remodel in the off-season</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are looking to remodel a green space, start planning and working in the off-season. For those not ready to plant or are just building up towards a green thumb, use the warm seasons to find inspiration, and plan during winter.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a typical timeline to guide you. Pro tip: Start the process early. Use the summer months prior to gather inspiration. In the fall, begin mapping out the design, landscaping, and materials with an architect/designer/contractor. “Planning, designing, and finalizing the fine details of the project can take months,” said Shenna. This gives the contractor enough time to work with the homeowner and/or designer to get all of the pieces in place.</p>
<p class="p1">By December, permits should be submitted, your contractor hired, and materials ordered (keep delivery times in mind).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Demolition should break ground by March/April for an outdoor remodel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“The best time to physically start working on an outdoor space is in the spring.” said Shenna. “The weather makes it possible to get everything prepped and ready.”</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6256#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor</span></a> Mike, who is based in NYC said, “The scope of the project, the square footage of the outdoor space, and material delays” will affect how much time goes into the planning phase in advance. Depending on the complexity of the project, an outdoor remodel typically takes two months to finish. However, an outdoor kitchen that requires plumbing, gas, and electrical could take longer for approvals than a deck remodel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an outdoor space, there’s a lot more to consider, like drainage. Your general contractor should have an in-depth understanding of how bulk water will be managed and how your plans will impact the neighbors. If you’re working on a roof, make sure you have access points for clearing roof drains.</p>
<h4>Organizing material delivery and approvals</h4>
<p class="p1">Your team will also have to haul all of the materials to your outdoor space. Hauling roof deck lumber, soil, sod, and plant matter up through service elevators can be costly and time-consuming. An alternative is booming materials to the roof by crane. Contractors usually have partnerships with local greenhouses and lumber yards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>They can move materials from the street to a garden more efficiently and cost-effectively than using a service elevator.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, make sure you have the necessary approvals. Most exterior improvements will require an alteration agreement and approval from the building&#8217;s architect, and many will require filing with the city. If you live in a landmarked building, special regulations will apply.</p>
<p class="p1">Start and plan early with the right professionals onboard. A well-planned deck or garden can greatly increase the value of a property. It will be time and money well-spent.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The importance of curb appeal renovations? Homeowners can add value <em>and</em> make an impression, with basic landscaping to prepping the roof.</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33007 size-chrono" title="exterior-large-brown-white-house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-723x406.jpg" alt="exterior of large brown and white house with sloping roof" width="723" height="406" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-723x406.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-300x168.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-600x337.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Landscape/curb appeal project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten landscape designer Michelle</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners who put their house on the market want it to be shown in the best light, and nowhere is this more important than with its exterior. Curb appeal provides the critical first impression to prospective buyers, creating the desire to step inside and see more—or to keep on driving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another advantage to strong curb appeal is that it makes for a pretty picture. Most house hunters start the process by looking at homes online and the first photo from the street can help draw buyers in and entice them to reach out to their realtor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deciding to improve the home&#8217;s exterior at resale is really a balancing act. Perhaps the first question to ask is: why do anything? It&#8217;s a valid question in a hot seller&#8217;s market where houses go on sale on Monday and are in contract by the next weekend. But an improvement can also keep negative impressions out of a buyer&#8217;s mind. Few people are wowed by a nice roof, but everyone can notice missing shingles, discoloration, and other signs of disrepair. Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, outlines the best areas for sellers to focus on for the best return on their budget.</p>
<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Consider the home buyer&#8217;s POV</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Curb appeal involves many different elements, from a well-manicured lawn to an eye-popping entryway to a new roof or siding. Deciding which projects to tackle comes down to what needs to be renovated or at least improved—if something is worn or damaged, it should be replaced or fixed—and based on the budget, what the improvement can add to the resale value of the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Check around the neighborhood to see what is most prevalent with other homes,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a>. &#8220;You want your home to fit in with the culture of the surrounding area. For example, you don&#8217;t want to install vinyl siding in a neighborhood with homes that are predominantly stucco or brick because people who are searching that particular neighborhood are looking for that specific look.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33009 size-chrono" title="brownstone" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front-723x542.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="542" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Landscaping project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten landscape designer Brook</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another obstacle is how homeowners perceive their home. Someone who has lived in the house happily for a number of years may not be aware of its flaws. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to get an opinion from someone else,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle, a contractor with Sweeten</a>. &#8220;Some of my clients call me and say they are looking to sell their house and wonder what they should do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with a qualified general contractor not only gives you the benefit of their expertise, but they can refer you to tradespeople they have worked with and trust—a valuable resource when trying to find a good contractor.</p>
<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Don&#8217;t overlook l</strong><strong>andscaping</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Improving the look of the landscape may be the easiest and least expensive way to enhance curb appeal. &#8220;The landscaping and its health are very important as a well-manicured lot will naturally draw attention to the home. It contributes to the overall look and feel of the place,&#8221; said Majid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Start by making sure the lawn is neatly trimmed and the planting beds have a fresh layer of mulch. Add color and texture by placing seasonal plants in pots around the entry. Ringing trees with mulch will give a kempt look to the yard. While this may sound simple, such attention to detail or hiring a landscape designer to do the work provides your front yard the professional polish it needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33008 size-chrono" title="house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-01-723x407.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="407" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Landscape project by Sweeten landscape designer Michelle</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a fence, give it a fresh coat of paint, whether it is a picket fence in the suburbs or an ironwork fence in the city. Its square footage measurement will determine the cost, as well as what shape it is in. “More labor is required if the fence is in bad condition,” explained Kyle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other more involved and expensive projects include adding a new front walkway or redoing the driveway, a key detail. Kyle said, &#8220;If the driveway is all beat up, the buyer is thinking, &#8216;I am going to have to replace it.'&#8221; The cost of renovating a walkway is also based on the square footage. This is the same for driveways except the cost is measured over the “blacktop, concrete and pavers. Another aspect that plays a part in the price is the elevation,” he said.</p>
<h3><strong>Remodeling and resale highlights</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both the <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Association of Realtors&#8217;</a> 2017 Remodeling Impact Report and <em><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remodeling</a></em>&#8216;s 2018 Cost vs. Value Report survey their audiences to estimate how common improvements affect resale value. Much of the data is based on the opinions of the professionals who were given descriptions of the project. The groups used different methodologies and the results do not perfectly align; however, the results extrapolated below could prove helpful for a homeowner making a renovation decision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Smaller-scale projects run the gamut from a fresh coat of paint on the front door to replacing the entry and garage doors. Larger improvements include repairing the roof to pass inspection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33103 size-chrono" title="Cost of Remodeling Projects for Curb Appeal vs Value Retained at Resale" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1000-Project-Graph-10a-723x815.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="815" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Entry door replacements</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entry door replacements range from installing a steel door at a cost of about $1,400 to $1,700 to a fiberglass door that can cost as much as $9,000. A custom door for a 100-plus-year-old brownstone will be priced higher. In general, installing a steel door will recoup a higher percentage of the original cost, mainly due to the lower upfront cost. But the location also plays a role. In New York, a fiberglass door fetches 90 percent of the original cost, while the national average is 68 percent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, very few projects actually earn back more money than they cost but keep in mind the goal is to bring foot traffic and potential buyers to your door. The exception: garage doors. The National Association of Realtors ranked replacing a garage door third among its eight projects surveyed that earn back their full cost. (A new roof was #1, followed by new vinyl windows). The report also stated that 24 percent of the realtors surveyed suggested to sellers that they replace the garage door, but only 3 percent cited that factor closed the deal with a buyer. On the bright side, the improvement added more than the cost of the project to the value of the home in the New York area.</p>
<h4>Roofing, siding, windows</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Roofing, siding, and windows are big-ticket undertakings that can cost $10,000 to $30,000 and projects that homeowners should consider carefully. Thirty-two percent of the realtors said that a new roof helped close a sale. &#8220;Roofing is important because the home inspector looks at it carefully,&#8221; said Kyle. The inspector will estimate the age and evaluate the condition of the shingles. New siding and windows helped close deals in the single digits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32965 size-chrono" title="house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2-723x482.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Renovation by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Bud</a></p>
<h4><strong>Making a decision on your curb appeal renovations</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What&#8217;s the timetable? If you plan on moving in the future, then a major improvement may be ideal because you can enjoy it while you are still in the house. Then there is the budget and the many things to consider here: the cost of the project, what it adds to the value of the house, the seller&#8217;s equity in the house, and how long will you get to enjoy the improvement before you move.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The last thing you want to do is have your home stick out like a sore thumb,&#8221; said Majid. &#8220;Overall, your safest bet as far as resale value is concerned is to stick with the general look of the neighborhood and neighboring homes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Want to achieve that “welcome factor” you need for a successful resale? Assess the condition of your home—whether its a series of small projects to larger-scale mends—and make a list. When you&#8217;re ready to start, use Sweeten to connect with expert general contractors (for free!) for your curb appeal renovation.</p>

<p class="p1">Enjoy a change of scenery in your own home. Outdoor spaces present an increase in living space and an upgrade to lifestyle. However, not all backyards are ready for “prime time” and a remodel is in order. NYC landscaping costs for the backyard include scope, flooring, demolition, fencing, electrical, and structures.</p>
<p class="p1">Fortunately, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every outdoor space can be improved</a> substantially with some great ideas and expert help. Our guide will help you understand the most common elements to consider in NYC with some tips from our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors. </p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Building an outdoor space: where to start</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Outdoor space runs the gamut from a simple patio to a full outdoor kitchen. What you can achieve at your home is going to be limited by three main factors: space available, your budget, and building codes. Of those three factors, codes might be the most perplexing—and least flexible.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For the most part, building codes exist for safety and you can either comply or change the design. They’re not that onerous for most outdoor projects, but you might face challenges from setbacks, for example. That means you can’t build right up to the property line in certain cases. Once you <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choose a NYC contractor</a> to work with, your GC will be invaluable in guiding you through design decisions that meet your desires <i>and</i> codes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Space available and budget are easier to grasp. When your contractor gives you a good idea of the buildable space and rough estimates for your “must-haves” and optional features, you can get going on your plan. Do a deep dive and check out projects that appeal to you. Creating a photo montage of completed projects that get you all frothy is a fun way to design!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg" alt="Backyard with stained cedar fencing along with white chairs and lawn grass after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50617" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) General contractor Santiago renovated this <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backyard space</a> for Sweeten homeowner KV Harper</p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Backyard landscaping cost: Outdoor flooring </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Knowing how you want to use your space is the first step to setting the budget. The outdoor-room concept is multi-faceted. Some people don’t want much besides a table for meals, others want to sunbathe, some want a spa, and the cooks want a full kitchen. Whatever your wants, you’ll have to start at the bottom: what you walk on. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you have an existing patio or roof to use, great, then you can move on to other elements. If your space does need some help with the flooring, though, you’ll find a host of possibilities. One of the most popular options, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Santiago</a> in New York, is bluestone patios. This material is durable and beautiful, if fairly expensive. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Bluestone pavers cost</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bluestone is a natural stone paver that offers beauty, durability, and flexibility. Cut bluestone pavers will cost from around $8/square foot for 1” thick stone and is available in many sizes. Smaller stones of about 12” square will give you a slightly different aesthetic than huge slabs, and are definitely easier to work with. Access can be a challenge in the city, and you might have to spring for a crane if you want large, heavy stones. There’s just no other way to move them in tight spaces. This process will cost you at least $2,000, not including the stone and site preparation. Smaller sizes are more manageable, though, and can be hauled by hand if necessary.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Concrete pavers cost</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To spend less, “Concrete pavers are available in dozens of size and color options for $4–5/square foot,” Santiago said. In addition, they don’t need a crane for installation. Installation for both concrete and stone pavers will be the same, with costs varying depending on the current base rather than the material you choose. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Calculating your backyard landscaping costs</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/nyc-landscaping-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Determining your </span><span class="s2">backyard landscaping costs</span></a><span class="s1"> are also determined by demolition work. That type of work will vary by what you have in place now, so contractors don’t want to guess on costs. Do you have an existing patio that must be removed? Or grass? How good is the access? Are you working on the ground floor or higher up? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There are so many variables that rough estimates without seeing the site aren’t possible, our contractors said. They need to see what’s there first and learn what you want before they can give an estimate. </span>Post your project on Sweeten to discuss the possibilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="s1">“I have to look at the job; two jobs are never alike. Labor is not easy to price. There are a lot of elements factoring in,” Santiago noted.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">NYC-based Sweeten general contractor Steve concurred, saying that there are backyard remodeling jobs where all materials have to come in and out through the front door. “A lot of the time you have to take the garbage out through the first floor, out the basement, or out the window. Everything has to be protected.”</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition to patios, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decks are popular</a> and sometimes do not require demolition and hauling out old materials. Decks can offer great flexibility in fitting into existing spaces, and they can also be particularly budget-friendly by overlaying an existing shabby concrete slab, saving the cost and hassle of demolition and removal.</span></p>
<h3>When to start planning your outdoor space</h3>
<p><span>Enjoy your green space for the summer by starting the process early. Use the summer months prior to gather inspiration. In the Fall, begin planning with an architect/designer/contractor on design, landscaping, and materials. By December submit permits, hire your contractor, and order materials (keep delivery times in mind). Demolition should break ground by March/April. Depending on the complexity of the project, an outdoor remodel typically takes two months to finish. Although an outdoor kitchen requiring plumbing, gas, and electrical could take longer for approvals vs a deck remodel.</span><span> </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Creating fencing and perimeter walls</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Fences and walls, too, are basic elements of most projects, and serve several functions. Privacy is usually a main concern, but view control and wind control are also important. Most people opt for wood fences, said Steve. As for design elements, “People in general want big wide planks; materials that are more architectural looking, with bright backgrounds,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“It depends on each client. Some people want a lot of space for seating. For all intents and purposes it’s an outside living room,” he noted. Fences offer a lot of design freedom, as well, including horizontal and vertical elements, natural wood tones or painted surfaces, and using wood, stone, and/or metal. “Most people do wood fencing,” Sweeten contractor Santiago said, “some choose pressure-treated, while others opt for cedar. It depends on the budget.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Outdoor lighting </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some details, such as lighting, are easy to overlook at first. It’s a major element in both ambiance and useability, however, and should be tackled at the design stage rather than tacked on later.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Everyone is into lighting,” Santiago said. “For this, you&#8217;ll need to factor in outlets. Floodlights can accent the plants. They can be simple but very cool.” Lighting and electrical are simple and easy compared to some other elements, but they require planning for running buried lines and removing overhead lines. When your contractor has a design for you, then it’s time to consider the lighting based on function. Lighting in the dining area is different from lighting for walkways and for plants. It’s all part of the design process.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Adding pergolas and arbors</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As another distinct element, pergolas and arbors provide shade, structure, and beauty to your outdoor room, as well as an often-needed vertical feature. Arbors are simple and small structures that often frame a pathway, while pergolas are larger and more substantial, sometimes attached to the house. You might train vines or climbing roses on the arbor, for example. Pergolas can use a slatted, cloth, or solid roofing material, making them flexible so you have both sun and shelter in your yard.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Landscaping front yard</span><span class="s3"> options</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In New York City, front yard spaces aren’t as common, but you can still add natural beauty. In addition to using fine materials for your front entry, steps, and railing, do you have room for planters? If you like plants, this is a great option for tight spaces and lets you add some color and texture. If live plants are too much work or tough to keep alive, planters can also house durable and seasonal items like spruce tops. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You can see a multitude of high-quality planters and pots online, and talk with your contractor about building some that fit your space exactly. Many people choose cedar for this project, as it’s beautiful and relatively rot-resistant. Other woods work fine, too, and can look great finished in paint or stain. Add your ideas to your photo montage and discuss with your renovation team.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Landscaping costs</span><span class="s1"> for homes in New York City can be tough to estimate without a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit from several firms</a>. </span><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your home or outdoor remodel, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with the right local contractor</a> to get you to your dream space. </span></p>

Other costs depend on the nature of the demolition required and if any perimeter fencing or structures, like pergolas, will be installed. Costs will increase if outdoor lighting requires running buried electrical lines. The contractor uses these factors and more to determine labor costs.</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The weather is just right this week for catching up on site with our friend Corey Hutson of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/680" target="_blank">Hutson Landscape Design LLC</a>. With Spring in the air, we asked Corey what he would be looking forward to most this season. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My absolute favorite are new rooftop garden designs, where I can do something truly unique. I love incorporating outdoor kitchens, showers and customizing the space to the clients&#8217; needs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
