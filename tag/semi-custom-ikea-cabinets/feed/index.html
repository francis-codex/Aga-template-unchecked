										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>After spending many years patching up a rental they lived in together, two architects decided to purchase their very own fixer-upper on the top floor of an 1890s brownstone on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. One may wonder whether Kate Meagher and Arthur Liu had the same basic questions as non-design pros when it came to budget calculations, the cost of relocating plumbing, or even where to find a contractor, and the answer is yes! Having fallen in love with the view of the Hudson River, high ceilings, and the fact that the apartment hadn’t been touched since the ‘60s, they embraced the cozy new home to make &lt;500-square-foot feel significantly bigger. The couple came to Sweeten to find a team to help them reconfigure walls, add space to the kitchen, and renovate the bath. Here, Kate and Arthur tell us about their renovation journey, including a painting project that took longer than anticipated—but the results were well worth it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21477" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-723x506.jpg" alt="unnamed" width="723" height="506" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-723x506.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-300x210.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-600x420.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-21420"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by Upper West Side homeowner Kate Meagher </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Arthur and I had been living in an apartment for around seven years, which belonged to his family. That apartment—much loved—was a constant work in progress. We improved the kitchen and bathroom, installed new lighting, and suffered through two floods (thanks, upstairs neighbors!) which required new ceilings and flooring yet again. As architects, we loved it—it was great to have a rental which we could experiment on. At a certain point, however, it seemed that we should be directing our energy toward a place that was truly ours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During our search, Arthur and I had gotten into a rhythm. After each Sunday’s open house tour, we’d stop in whichever neighborhood we ended up in, get a drink, and sketch floor plans over the broker’s listing sheets. Could we fit a dishwasher? How did the closet compare with our old one? How much would it cost if the plumbing needed to be reconfigured? (Sweeten’s construction and renovation <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guides</a> were extremely helpful setting initial <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/renovation-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a> targets.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were obviously looking for a fixer-upper, and when we saw this apartment, we fell in love despite its tiny size. It’s right next to Riverside Park, on the top floor of a beautiful brownstone. The ceilings are high and the bay windows still have the original curved glass. In the winter, when the leaves are off the trees, we can see the Hudson. Best yet, outside of some electrical updates, the apartment hadn’t been touched since the 1960s. The main priorities for this apartment were to update and expand the kitchen, renovate the bathroom, and to squeeze as much storage space in without impacting the small footprint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had come across Sweeten at some point in our apartment search, and it was the first place we looked for a general contractor after we closed. Arthur and I both work on very large ground-up projects and don’t regularly work with contractors on the scale of a New York apartment renovation—we needed help finding someone! Sweeten definitely filled a niche for us, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we posted our project</a>. We interviewed several and chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>. I was struck by the notes he took throughout our initial walk-through, and that he asked for time to review further on his own. We felt he really listened and understood what we wanted and could accomplish it within our timeframe and budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21455 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Arthur_floor_plan-723x482.jpg" alt="Arthur_floor_plan" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21431 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-03" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21436 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21438 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-07" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21439" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-08" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love the classic detailing in the apartment and wanted to preserve everything we could that was more or less original. However, both our sensibilities skew contemporary/minimalist when designing, and we were looking to strike a balance. We decided to make only a few key alterations to the floorplan. First, the wall separating the kitchen/bath zone and the living room was moved, gaining us a little more than a foot-and-a-half extra. The bathroom feels more generous now, and most importantly, it allowed us to configure a narrow L-shape for the kitchen. We chose tall doors for them to align with the height of the bay windows, and drew a custom profile for the door frames—beautifully executed by our contractor’s team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The extra L-shaped length was critical to add a full-height refrigerator, full-height pantry cabinet, and an 18” dishwasher. We installed shallow 15-inch-deep cabinets in the new leg, and kept all appliances to the adjacent wall. This preserved as much floor space as possible, and had the added benefit of retaining the original locations for the plumbing, gas lines, and ducted extractor—no permits to file or added expense of rerouting. We wanted a minimal aesthetic—black and white. Ultimately, we took our cues from a soapstone countertop we saw on a Sweeten blog <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. After visiting M. Teixeira’s amazing warehouse, we chose a stone that had a lot of green undertones in the black base. For the cabinet paints, we decided on an extremely dark black-green shade, and a cool white to complement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This space ended up being a special project in the apartment. While our contractor&#8217;s team completed the major work—prepping the walls, installing wood flooring, adding lighting, installing the appliances and sink, and tiling the backsplash—Arthur and I ended up building the rest of the kitchen ourselves (!) using Ikea base cabinets that we modified and custom fronts. We also decided to just paint the fronts ourselves. (*Note: after doing it and coming out the other side, this is NOT recommended. However, if you have the time, patience and space, you will save a lot.) For those of you interested in the details: We needed to paint 26 panels—some over ten ft tall—inside the apartment because, well, that’s the only space we had. Working in stages, we brushed two coats per side, sanded, vacuumed and wiped down with a tack cloth between each coat. And our two cats meant even more obsessive vacuuming and confining them to the bedroom for most of the full month it took to paint—the threat of fur was everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21429 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-01" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21441 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-11" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21440" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-09-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedroom, our excellent foreman, Al, demolished a loft bed, and combined the small bedroom closet with an adjacent coat closet. We’ve hung a full-height curtain, so we can use every last inch of the ceiling height for storage. The entry door from the living room into the bedroom was moved toward the kitchen. Previously, it was right in the middle of a living room wall, making that room very difficult to furnish. The team expertly restored the plaster walls, and matched new wood flooring inside the closet area and kitchen with the original (our contractor really pulled through with that find!). New moldings were also seamlessly integrated in areas that had been exposed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21430 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-02" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21435 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21443 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-13" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21432" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom skews warmer in tone than the kitchen, and was designed as a spare and sleek space. We replaced the tub with a wet room—an open shower without curtains or doors—and rain shower head to keep the lines clean and open up the room. (This required an <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/business/laa.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAA permit</a>, which called for a master plumber.) A wing wall keeps all the water from splashing out, and conceals a recessed shelf for products. The contractor&#8217;s team—Al specifically—were truly master tilers. We chose a tiny copper ceramic mosaic for the floor, shower curb and base, and creamy white, elongated tile for the walls. The grout is a warm brown that picks up on the terracotta edges of the white tile and the copper tones of the floor tile. We, of course wanted every joint to match and it does. We opted for a large recessed mirrored medicine cabinet to contain clutter and a wall-mounted sink with no cabinet. Everything fits except the hairdryer, which lives in the credenza directly outside of the bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21442" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-12-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-12" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are so happy with how the project turned out. Maybe it’s the sweat equity, but it is always very satisfying to see your design realized. We couldn&#8217;t have done it without our Sweeten contractor, Al and the team. They were a pleasure to work with throughout and we’d love to collaborate again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thank you so much, Arthur and Kate, for sharing your story. It’s always intriguing to hear about a home renovation from the point of view of architects! We hope you enjoy your new home.</em></p>

Guest post by Corey, Williamsburg homeowner</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Burned out by a decade of renting in the city, we entered the buyer’s market with little knowledge of how volatile it would be. After a search that saw us move too slowly on a modest but well-located unit, and then get completely outbid on a dream apartment, we stumbled upon a two-bed, two-bath condo in Williamsburg. Not wanting to miss out again, we put in a bid and were surprised to get the place. That could very well have been the end of the story, but what fun would that be?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’d be the first to admit that the unit we purchased was totally serviceable. Only a few years old, it was a corner apartment with decent square footage and great city/bridge views in an increasingly popular zip code. The unit had been rented to a prolific painter who’d kept the walls white and the creativity high. It was a serviceable blank canvas; what it wasn’t was the dream apartment we’d lost out on months earlier. Regardless of how excited we were to be new owners, we just couldn’t shake the “if only&#8230;” feeling for that spot and started thinking about ways to incorporate elements from the coveted (but now somebody else’s) space into our new home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had no idea where to start, but after a search on New York renovations, I stumbled upon <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and spent a few days ghost-stalking various featured projects on the site. This gave me many ideas and the more we explored changes for our space, the bigger the scope of this potential project became, so we decided to focus on the area that could make the biggest impact: the kitchen. As it was, the apartment opened into a cramped one with little countertop space, limited storage, basic appliances, and no defined dining area. There was unused space above the cabinets and an odd mixture of lighting fixtures. In a nutshell, it was a cookie cutter kitchen in a cookie cutter condo and we really wanted something with more character.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13107" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE.png" alt="SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE" width="600" height="225" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE-300x113.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I put together a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project post on Sweeten</a> with a fairly clear idea of the feeling we wanted the place to evoke, even if the specifics weren’t totally defined. Sweeten introduced us to a few design teams and we decided to work with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Thomas</a> and his design/build team based on images of some of the spaces they had designed in Little Italy. We had them come out to the apartment to see what we had and right away, the team showed enthusiasm for the project and the type of aesthetic we were hoping to achieve. In hindsight, that was probably the most important decision we made &#8211; identifying the team that seemed to best understand the vision we had and showed a willingness to get us there (and stay within our budget) was key.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thomas&#8217;s team introduced us to their design/build approach and though I had no experience with the model, it became clear we would be working very closely to get the space just the way we wanted it. But what was that, exactly? Aside from being slight on storage and functionality, our complaint was that the kitchen was generic, so looking to the neighborhood for inspiration, we envisioned a design that embraced the industrial history of the area without being too rustic. We also wanted to maximize the space by creating a more open floor plan. Through conversations with the design team, we zeroed in on a classic palette incorporating white, gray, brown, charcoal, black, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Palette aside, there was little hope of gaining storage or making the space feel more open without a pretty drastic change to the layout. Thomas and his team walked us through possible reconfigurations; we entertained the idea of installing an island or lengthening the counter, but because of the central placement of the sink and dishwasher, the only way to address the problem was to relocate both. Cue the plumber. The upside? We were able to position the sink in front of the window (where it probably should have been in the first place?) and create a longer countertop surface as well as additional storage both above and below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They say the devil is in the details and we learned this firsthand once the floor plan had been chosen and the time came to fill it. We have an admittedly eclectic style so the conversations about materials were lengthy and the direction of the design changed a few times. We went in knowing we liked metal, glass, tile and wood because they suggested the “industrial” feel we liked, but it was most important that we assembled comfortable and clean materials. We knew we wanted appliances that would allow for entertaining and easy food prep and a look that would match, so a lot of time was spent narrowing down the colors of the tile and millwork and countertop and shopping for new appliances.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the design/build process, we were able to combine an <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA</a> pre-built cabinet base system with custom doors, buffed and polished to create a bespoke look &#8211; a color that did not exist before we requested it! We finished the cabinetry with hardware from <a href="https://www.anthropologie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthropologie</a> and found the backsplash tile at <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nemo Tile</a>. Thomas added open shelving repurposed from wood that his team sourced, and complemented the look with a decorative but spare hanging pendant from <a href="https://www.abchome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC Carpet and Home</a>. The dishwasher, range, and fridge are all <a href="https://www.vikingrange.com/consumer/index.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking</a>. We found the table and benches at ABC Home before we bought this place and love how they work here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many things about the design that I love, and each component is like a puzzle piece that connects to a memory. The feature that I still find the most exciting is the countertop. Once we knew we’d be relocating the sink, and nearly doubling the counter surface area in the process, I knew it was critical to choose the right material as it would be prominently featured. Thomas had shown us a space they were finishing with a soapstone countertop and we inquired about the possibility of doing that in our space. They were more than willing to help us make that work and took us out to their supplier’s stoneyard to look at slabs. While there, we saw the integrated countertop/sink configuration on display and were sold. We also opted for a “waterfall” edge which helped distinguish the kitchen/dining areas.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I would be lying if I said it was all completely painless, but as I look back, it’s obvious that every trial we ran across, whether it be plumbing surprises or tile irregularities or whatever, we chose a design firm committed to making good on our contract together. They were as invested as we were in seeing the space come out the way we wanted and along the way the team at Sweeten (Jean and Shera) were both very much in the loop and always asking how they could assist. I doubt I will embark on another renovation anytime in the near future but if I did, I’d certainly return to Sweeten and would recommend them to anyone looking to transform their home.</p>
