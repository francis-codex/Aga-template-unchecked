										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What can homeowners do when they need more space at home—but don&#8217;t want to leave?</h2>
<p>Many homeowners find themselves in a tough spot when their home&#8217;s space, design, or location stops working for them. Many wind up asking themselves: should I move, or remodel?  A <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/americans-prefer-renovations-21576/">Zillow study</a> found that when given a choice between spending a fixed budget on a down payment or using the same amount to remodel, 76 percent would opt to renovate.</p>
<p>Between leaving their neighborhoods and staying put, these homeowners ultimately made the choice to reimagine their homes with Sweeten&#8217;s help. <span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>A big refresh for a beloved loft</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leah and Brian loved the Logan Square <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loft they had been calling home</a> for several years. The Chicago neighborhood’s energy and the industrial brick warehouse added to the lifestyle they were enjoying. But with time the wear-and-tear takes a toll on materials and daily functioning. They decided to renovate and stay in the area. The couple posted their project on Sweeten to update the entire space including a new kitchen and floors. Without structural changes, Leah and Brian brought out the best of their 14-foot ceilings.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="white-island-separator-blue-cabinets"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48144 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After.jpg" alt="white island separator in a kitchen with blue cabinets and white countertop space along with blue wallpaper and open white shelves" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>When you can&#8217;t go bigger, get creative</h3>
<p>Surging prices in her Fort Greene co-op building made upgrading from a studio to a true one-bedroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">out of the question for Mollie</a>. She had to decide to either move elsewhere to get more space or remodel her cozy studio. Luckily, Mollie realized the market value of her apartment (and that she could borrow against her equity)! She came to Sweeten, was matched with a general contractor, and reconfigured the 500-square-foot apartment to suit her playful style.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="light-brick-wall-narrow-living-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48148 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4.jpg" alt="light brick wall in a narrow living room with plush gray and blue furniture and open metal shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Baby on the way? Make your square footage go further</h3>
<p>A two-bedroom apartment was perfect for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-duplex-renovated-for-a-new-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel and Marco</a>—until they decided to expand their family. Fortunately, their duplex had enough square footage for them to get creative with! This made it possible to remodel and rethink how they used the layout, instead of moving. They turned the top floor into a combined kitchen and living area, while they divided the rest of the space into an office, closet, and bedrooms.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-gray-cabinets"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48147 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg" alt="white kitchen with gray kitchen cabinets under white countertop and farmhouse style sink after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Give a well-loved home some TLC upgrades</h3>
<p>After a year-long search for a new apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/renovating-to-stay-in-a-beloved-neighborhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Igor</a> decided their sons’ schools, proximity to work, and an overall adoration for their lifestyle in Carroll Gardens were reason enough to stay in their apartment. They worked with a Sweeten general contractor to overhaul their dark kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom. The result? Open and modern spaces fit for the family of four.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-barn-door-large-living-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48146 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg" alt="white barn door in a large living room with large windows and natural wood flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Combine two apartments into one home, sweet home</h3>
<p>A desire for more room led to multiple (unsuccessful) apartment searches for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoe and Arvid</a>. Her dream of renovating and combining apartments finally put the hunt to an end. After contacting neighbors and finding one who was looking to move, their plan was underway. The additional square footage allowed for a third bedroom, a much larger kitchen, and an expanded living area.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="large-gray-living-room-vinyl-floor"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48145 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg" alt="large gray and white living room with large windows and brown vinyl floor after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting &#8220;upstate&#8221; light and space—with a city zip code</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney and Jim’s</a> Clinton Hill Co-op apartment lacked storage and light, which sent them on a search for a second home upstate. When they made an offer on the second property, reality hit: they needed to make their main residence work for them before taking on a new place. The couple decided to remodel, opening up the kitchen the rest of the living areas and reconfiguring storage closets to suit the family of four’s storage needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom Reber, the founder of <em>The Contractor Fight,</em> offers answers to common contractor issues and community support</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47552" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-2.jpg" alt="Tom Raber contractor fight" width="2000" height="1334" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-2.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When owning your own contracting business, day-to-day questions or larger issues will come up where answers are uncertain or the path forward isn’t clear. A contracting community as a sounding board can be helpful in your goal to keep your business moving and growing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this first of two blog posts, <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> talks with Tom Reber, founder of <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/"><span class="s2">The Contractor Fight</span></a>. Tom explains how to start job-costing, discussing profit and overhead with clients, and common issues that general contractors are facing within his coaching groups. You can also check out <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/category/the-contractor-fight-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his podcast</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten matches general contractors</a> </span><span class="s1">with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is the easiest way to start job-costing?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> A lot of general contractors overcomplicate this. It is as simple as doing the math on a regular basis. Ask yourself, “What am I spending per day to do this job?” “How many guys worked today, and what did I pay them?” “What did we spend at Home Depot?” Most people are just afraid to do the math, but if you do it daily or even weekly, it can be a lot less overwhelming.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How do you recommend GCs discuss profit and overhead with clients? </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> On occasion, a customer might ask, “How much profit do you make?” I typically respond with “That is a great question! We make X, which allows us to attract top talent, pay good salaries, benefits, and allows us to honor warranties.” Don’t skirt the question or get defensive—answering honestly and openly shows that you are transparent, run a tight shop, and have integrity.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s3">What are the most common issues facing GCs in your coaching groups? What do you recommend to address these issues? </span></h3>
<h4>Problem: Limited access to new ideas</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> Hands down, the number one issue is just looking at the symptom, like not making enough money or poor employee retention, and not figuring out the root cause. This problem is caused by how you think &#8211; they [contractors] get advice from their other unsuccessful contractor buddies, which continues to limit their thinking. </span></p>
<h4>Solution: Expand your network</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> You are the average of the five people you spend time with. Make sure you surround yourself with people who can help you, rather than hold you back. </span><span class="s1">By joining our group, you get access to different ways of thinking, including the Daily Challenge, which encourages you to test and learn. You will get comfortable with the uncomfortable—and <em>that</em> is when real change can happen.</span></p>
<h4>Problem: Not tackling the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right</span> issues</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> </span>The second biggest issue I see is a lack of clarity and consistency. As I mentioned in a previous answer, you need to get clarity on your biggest issues and then consistently attack it. You dug this hole over time, so don’t expect it to be solved overnight! You need to have grit and stick with those good daily habits that lead to progress.</p>
<h4>Solution: Focus on the numbers</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> </span>One of my favorite suggestions is to install KPI Fridays. This means dedicating some time at the end of the week to focus on your numbers, whether it be job costing or goal setting and tracking. It may seem remedial, but that is where most people need to start.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">A guide to home renovation costs for New Jersey in 2020, including kitchen, bath, and whole-home (plus a basement budget and permit tips!)</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45614 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1.jpg" alt="open kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our </span><span class="s1">most up-to-date New Jersey </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and New Jersey <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nine million New Jerseyans live in the Garden State. And why not? There’s the option to live close to beaches, own a farm, or live the quintessential American suburban life. There’s also a convenient commute to New York City and Pennsylvania. </span><span class="s1">According to the US Census, 64 percent of the houses are owned by the inhabitants, which means there are a lot of homes available for renovation. </span></p>
<h3>Set a budget for New Jersey home renovation costs</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re embarking on a home renovation, your first stop will be creating a realistic budget so you can compare what you have to spend and what you might need to spend to get what you want. Each project will have a unique process and outcome with many variables that will increase or decrease costs. From your tastes in material and workmanship to changes in layout, many elements will impact your budget. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luckily, </span><span class="s1">Sweeten has done some of the homework for you when it comes to home renovation costs for New Jersey. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/new-jersey-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—at no cost to the homeowner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a breakdown of typical starting home renovation costs in New Jersey, compiled from Sweeten renovations and <i>Remodeling</i>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/trenton-nj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value report</span></a>. Renovators in denser areas closer to New York City will likely see slightly higher budgets. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Full home renovation: <b>$100 per square foot (psf) and up</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end kitchen remodel: <b>$20,000 </b>to<b> $25,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range kitchen remodel: <b>starting at $30,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end kitchen remodel: starting at <b>$60,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end bathroom remodel: <b>$15,000 </b>to<b> $20,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range bathroom remodel: <b>$685 psf</b> or <b>$24,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end bathroom remodel and expansion: starting at <strong>$40,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Basement remodel: starting at <b>$20,000</b><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But remember this: While it is great to have an idea of your end cost, a contractor will want a detailed conversation and inspection of your home before delivering a more specific estimate.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey home remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey is a big state. In the northeastern part of the state, real estate prices are slightly lower than neighboring New York City. Western NJ has more affordable rural properties that give New Jersey the nickname “Garden State” for its extensive agricultural industry. The same cost variations can occur when it comes to renovating your New Jersey home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most Sweeten projects generally start at<b> $100 per square foot</b> <b>(psf)</b> in New Jersey. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3903#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Norm</a>, who is based in Northern New Jersey, has seen gut renovations start at <b>$200 psf</b> and go up from there. This cost range also includes everything from architectural design and drawings to fixtures, demolition, expediting, construction—the whole project.</span></p>

<h4>Easier logistics in New Jersey</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are fewer obstacles to a New Jersey renovation than, say, a place like New York City, according to Norm. For example, New Jersey renovations don&#8217;t normally have parking and access issues or limited hours a co-op will allow for daily construction. This can mean more efficient use of time, less hassle, and a smaller budget for clients in New Jersey.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">House renovations can be lighter on the wallet, too. Houses typically have the upside of direct access, while apartments do not. In apartments, contractors must take extra care (and time) to keep communal hallways and lobbies clean and clear. “All those things make a home renovation much less labor-intensive than an apartment,” said Norm.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a New Jersey kitchen remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<h5>Lower-end budgets</h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at <b>$20,000 </b>to<b> $25,000</b> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">One New Jersey-based Sweeten contractor</span><span class="s1"> had completed a kitchen in Monmouth County’s Fair Haven for under <b>$25,000</b> at <b>$100 </b>psf. For flooring, he used a prefinished engineered floor lumber core with a real wood veneer on the top layer. This cost <b>$2,500</b>. The cabinets were purchased ready to install and a stone counter was paired with a stainless steel undermount sink, which was quite cost-effective. A good budget number per square foot of floor space would be <b>$100</b> to <b>$150 psf</b> for economical kitchens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua, a Sweeten contractor</a></span><span class="s1"> who does a lot of renovations in Monmouth and Ocean counties, recently redid a 160-square-foot kitchen for under <b>$20,000</b>. To stick within this economical budget, he used vinyl plank flooring, a basic subway tile backsplash, and premade cabinets that come in standard measurement options like 12, 15, and 21 inches. “You can make it pretty close with those measurements, but with custom, you can make it fit exactly to what the space is,” Joshua said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another New Jersey-based Sweeten contractor agreed that a kitchen renovation can start at under <b>$20,000</b> for something basic (premade stock cabinets, basic appliances, etc.) and small (10’ x 10’ square feet).</span></p>
<h5>Mid to high-end budgets</h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range kitchen: Sweeten has seen mid-range kitchens start at <strong>$30,000</strong>. Joshua puts a mid-range kitchen in a range up to<b> $40,000</b>. Instead of hitting up big-box stores like Home Depot, as you would for a lower-end kitchen, this price bracket allows you to shop in specialty stores for items like tiles or cabinets, Joshua said. <i>Remodeling</i>’s Cost vs. Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/trenton-nj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">report</span></a> puts a typical mid-range kitchen renovation at <b>$375 psf</b> or <b>$75,000</b> total as an average for Trenton, New Jersey’s capital.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end kitchen: Sweeten’s typical remodel starts at <strong>$60,000</strong>. The average cost for this level in Trenton, New Jersey, is <b>$145,000</b> or <b>$725 psf</b>, according to <i>Remodeling</i>’s Cost vs. Value <span class="s2">report</span>. </span>The largest kitchen project Norm completed in New Jersey was more than <b>$150,000</b>. Pumping up the price were items such as a kitchen island with double-thick quartz and a waterfall edge, a Wolf range, reclaimed wood beams added to the ceiling, a wine fridge, and a very large square footage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a New Jersey bathroom remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end bathroom: Sweeten bathrooms can start at <b>$15,000 </b>to<b> $20,000</b> for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bathroom renovations can cost less if the majority of materials come from big-box stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot for porcelain tiles, a molded sink, and a fiberglass shower. “The crux of the job is always similar in terms of what you have—a toilet, a shower, tiles, vanities—then you expand your budget with what finishes you use,” Joshua said.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range bathroom: A mid-range bathroom that covers about 35 square feet in New Jersey will cost on average <b>$24,000</b>, according to the Cost vs. Value report. This comes out at <b>$685 psf</b> and can include a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain tub. Typically, the smaller the space, the higher the square foot cost.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end bathroom: Sweeten has seen high-end bathrooms start at <strong>$40,000</strong>. That same Cost Vs. Value report puts a high-end bathroom renovation at <b>$75,000</b>, based on a bathroom expanded from 35 square feet to 100 square feet (or <b>$750 psf</b>).<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The budget of a recent bathroom that Norm worked on came to that<strong> $75,000</strong> average. “It had it all—an oversized, walk-in steam shower with body sprays and frameless glass,” he said. Additionally, it had custom carpentry and a freestanding tub, “which are very expensive,” Norm added. Then, there is the less exciting but very important work of replacing the plumbing lines. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46406 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png" alt="Find New Jersey Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for a basement renovation in New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a basement remodel in the New Jersey area, expect the starting cost to begin at <strong>$20,000</strong>. The Cost vs. Value report puts an average basement conversion in New Jersey at <b>$117 psf</b>. The example project cost <b>$75,000</b> and was 20’ x 30’ with a 5’ x 8’ bathroom, shower, a bar area, insulation, and laminate flooring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there’s a lot to take into account that will impact the budget. Sometimes the floor needs to be dug deeper to raise the ceiling height. The walls could require underpinning. Electricity and plumbing might need to be installed if there is no existing bathroom. Installation and waterproofing can be significantly costly if it is needed, as well as pumps to drain out water. Some clients just want new drywall, new doors, a new closet, and fresh paint, which could put a project near <b>$20,000.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A premium basement could cost between <b>$100,000</b> and <b>$150,000</b>, according to Sweeten contractor Norm. Clients tend to get creative with basements, from custom bar areas to cinema-style entertainment rooms. “I’ve done a lot that are geared towards homeschooling with learning nooks built underneath stairs,” he said. “Or there’s been funky, retro-style laundries with dropdown racks that fall out of the walls.” </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for permits in New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, there’s a lot of good news for New Jersey renovators when it comes to permits! A few years ago, the state eliminated the need for projects to get a permit for minor work. For example, a bathroom renovation in which fixtures are being directly replaced (often referred to as “rip-and-replace”). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Doing direct replacement — replacing the toilet or oven, old for new — will keep your costs down,” said Norm. This means plumbing and gas lines can stay as is, which can be a huge expense saver. However, for trickier renovations requiring permits, some Sweeten contractors suggest budgeting 10-15 percent of the entire project’s cost for permits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In New Jersey, permits are often handled by each town and will likely be tied to the budget you submit.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">In the township of <span class="s2">Teaneck</span> in Bergen County, the first <b>$50,000</b> in your renovation or repair budget will cost <b>$30</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for permits (so permits for that <b>$20,000</b> kitchen you’re planning will be about <b>$600</b>). The next <b>$50,000</b> in a budget will cost <b>$24</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of planned work and any amount over <b>$100,000</b> will cost <b>$22</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of planned work.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">In <a href="https://www.morristwp.com/DocumentCenter/View/4041/Construction-Code-Fees?bidId=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Morris Township</span></a>, a permit will cost <b>$33—$44</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for the first <b>$50,000</b> of the renovation budget and <b>$27—$33</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for the next <b>$50,000</b> and <b>$20—$28</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for a project over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">For <a href="https://ecode360.com/12008181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Toms River</span></a> in Ocean County, the fee will be <b>$39</b> per<b> $50,000</b> of the estimated cost of work, add <b>$25</b> for projects budgeted from <b>$50,001—$100,000</b> and add <b>$19</b> for projects costing over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>

<p class="p1"><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></p>
<p>I was born and raised in <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bensonhurst, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooklyn. When I was around 17 or 18, I started working for a family friend in a cabinet factory. At the age of 22, I went out on my own—and I have never looked back!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What do you love most about your job?</strong></p>
<p>I love the challenge as well as seeing the final result.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the biggest challenge you face when renovating in New York?</strong></p>
<p>Pick your poison: parking, getting in or out, etc. Working in an urban area can be difficult.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</strong></p>
<p>Most times, homeowners aren&#8217;t realistic about the timeframe for the work needed. They should do their homework by <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-101/">researching materials, timelines,</a> and other things to expect when they are working with a general contractor on a renovation.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</strong></p>
<p>We stand behind our work; we are professionals. Also, t<span style="font-weight: 400;">hey can contact me 24-7; I always answer my phone.</span></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite project you have done?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really enjoyed working with one of my clients on her home in Bed-Stuy. She was very helpful, rolled with the punches, and we communicated really well. The end result was a beautiful kitchen with a cool red Viking stove. </span></p>

<p><b>What is your favorite New York City restaurant?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avra Madison Estiatorio, 60th Street &amp; Madison Ave. </span></p>
<p><b>If you weren’t a general contractor, what would you be doing?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would be a real estate agent.</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite cocktail?</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s true their original purpose was solely functional, exposed beams have proven their worth beyond utility time and time again. Whether your home has an industrial, rustic, or contemporary feel, they up the drama and demand attention.

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41026" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sara and Mike gave their Tudor home a modern layout when they had their contractor knock down walls and create an open concept kitchen and dining space. To bring back more of the home’s Tudor characteristics (and to provide structural support) their contractor brought in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/1930s-westchester-tudor-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exposed beams that echo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the rest of the woodwork.</span></p>
<h3>1929 exposed beams preserve Parisian-chic style</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40408" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20.jpg" alt="living area" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s further proof that exposed beams can work for </span> any home style<span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Liya and her family’s Parisian-chic home, the contractor left the original 1929 beams intact. The white walls, ceilings, and beams create a crisp and clean look that contrasts with the dark wood floors and charcoal furnishings.</span></p>
<h3>An industrial, clean take on beams</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-20051 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20051 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="exposed beams, home renovation, design, construction, open living" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A renovation surprise may not always be a good thing, but in the case of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lia and Chris’ </a>Williamsburg loft remodel, it most certainly was. Their top-floor unit with a terrace, parking space, and sky-high ceilings offered another benefit: original beams. Much to the couple’s delight, their contractor proposed they open up the walls and ceiling encasing building beams in the kitchen and living room. “This eliminated awkward lines and revealed some industrial elements,” Lia said.</p>
<h3>Once hidden behind walls, beams become new focal point</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-24689 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24689 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="exposed beams, home renovation, design, construction, open living" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meg and Brett’s</a> carriage home in Hamilton Heights was already chockful of historical charm, and once they exposed the original beams, it went to the next level. How they found the beams is a story in itself: “We walked around and knocked on the drywall—if it felt hollow, we put a hole through to see what was underneath,” Brett said. They came across different sets: wooden ones original to the carriage house, and iron beams installed to support the structure. “Some of the beams had initials in them, and we even found a horsehair or two caught in the wood,” he added.</p>
<h3>Exposed beams add character (and even out ceilings!)</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-21828 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21828 mb-0 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1.jpg" alt="exposed beams, home renovation, design, construction, open living" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You know how the saying goes, if you don’t have it, add it. Jessica and David’s 875-square-foot apartment in Hudson Heights saw a lot of updates to make it work for their family. One stylistic addition they requested? Exposed beams. They wanted to bring more character to the space and as it turned out, the update served a dual purpose: the beams placed on the ceiling helped conceal an unfortunate spot where the ceiling was higher.</p>
<h3><strong>Recessed lighting within beams adds light, separation</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-32367 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32367 size-full" title="gray-living-space-recessed-lights" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02.jpg" alt="gray living space with recessed lights on ceiling and couch along with white round breakfast table and chairs after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>First-time renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/with-this-reno-i-thee-wed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather and Eric</a> took on a dark co-op apartment renovation in Manhattan with the intention to lighten and open up the barren space. To turn the blank canvas into a home with more interesting detail, plus tackle a need for overhead lighting, they added non-support beams in the living room and bedroom. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The structures offered a stylish and unique lighting solution that felt inherent to the home. </span></p>
<h3>Cobble Hill home goes to new heights after finding hidden beams</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-26642 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26642 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="exposed beams, home renovation, design, construction, open living" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
It’s amazing what can be unveiled in a renovation. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miguel</a> set to renovate his “bland, cookie-cutter, white box” of an apartment in Cobble Hill and to his total surprise, learned it wasn’t so ordinary. The contractor was fixing some electrical issues and came across a brick wall, and then a ceiling of beautiful beams! Since the ceilings weren’t very high, Miguel decided to paint them white to make the apartment feel bigger and brighter.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting started on commercial renovations can be both an exciting and overwhelming time. Perhaps you’re launching a business you’ve been dreaming about for a long time, or, if that dream has already proven successful, you’re expanding (congratulations!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches business owners to the best general contractors and helps the renovation stay on track, offers these guidelines for taking on commercial renovations, whether you are gearing up for an office build-out, a restaurant, retail space or some other venture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We based this article on New York City, but it has relevance to wherever you are in the country. The majority of US states base their codes on guidelines from the International Code Council. Cities and towns also have similar procedures when it comes to requirements such as building permits and Certificate of Occupancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few ways to get a head start with your own research. For example, taking a look at your potential building&#8217;s Certificate of Occupancy (CO) or browsing through online building records to get an idea of existing violations. Once you are seriously considering either buying or leasing a property or renovating what you have, that’s the right time to bring in a pro—an engineer, an architect, or a good or knowledgeable general contractor—so there are no surprises down the road.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few things to consider before unleashing the sledgehammer, and in some cases, signing a lease.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40003 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/HowSweetenWorks.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="50" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review the certificate of occupancy</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Number one, two, and three on your checklist before even committing to a lease should be: check the CO, check the CO, and check the CO. The document shows what you can legally use a property for—an office, a private residence, a restaurant, etc. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Here’s a <a href="https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/bsqpm01.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> to search in New York City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changing a CO is a costly process and, in some cases, it’s impossible to shift it to another use, according to Mercedes Hernandez from S&amp;M Expediting. Expediters are an optional addition to your building team to speed up the slow grind of permits, especially for commercial renovations in bureaucratic cities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We get a lot of calls after the fact when they start the process of getting necessary licenses. That’s when they realize they have a problem,” she said. One client signed a lease with the intention of turning a space into a gym. However, the certificate did not allow for a health club in the premises. That client is still trying to change it and it has already been 12 months. The easiest route is to lease or buy a space where the CO fits your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COs can also dictate smaller issues. For example, if you want to use the property’s backyard for additional restaurant seating, the certificate needs to specify that this is allowable. Otherwise, the CO will need <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/cofo_guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updating</a>. Smaller additions such as this are a much easier fix than a change in the legal use of a property, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><br />Understand existing violations on your property</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Especially if the property you’re eyeing hasn’t changed hands or had a new tenant for some time, it’s possible it already has building violations. It could be that someone did work without a permit, installed a rooftop AC unit incorrectly, or the fire sprinkler system isn’t functioning. “When you go to get a permit, these things are scrutinized and discovered,” explained <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. If the violations aren’t corrected, that could mean a costly stop-work order on your construction project later on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To kickstart this process, like COs, city councils often keep online databases where you can search open violations, when a permitted job was last completed on a building, and what that job was. Complaints about the building—such as work without a permit or a business operating without the correct CO—might also give you a hint at what violations you could encounter. The good news is with a commercial lease it is common to get these violations taken care of by the landlord, but the lease needs to specify this, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While you might get a sense of a building’s open violations from your own research, it’s unlikely you will spot every one of them on your own. The best plan is to walk through a potential location for your business with an architect, engineer or a GC, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Mark</a>, another Sweeten general contractor. That pro will help you decide if a property is a workable fit for your vision, he said. It’s also something that pros often do as a complimentary service to potential clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you need to determine if your property can handle the weight of your business. And in some cases, we mean that quite literally. Hernandez’s example illustrates the point: if you want to flip a clothing retail space into a car showroom, it’s a wise idea to make sure the floor can support the added weight. Or how about creating an open-plan office that’s perfect for teamwork? Before drawing up those plans, you need to know what walls are load-bearing and if they can be moved. If moving that wall (or not) is a deal breaker, it’s best to know the capabilities of a space before signing on the dotted line. “You need to ask what are the limits of design,” said Sweeten contractor Colin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessing the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEPs) situation is crucial especially if you’re turning a space into a food establishment with a kitchen. Gas, plumbing and electrical will be under more pressure, so can the property’s existing infrastructure handle it, or is an extensive overhaul required? If it is, prepare your budget and timeline realistically. That’s <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/nycbe/downloads/pdf/nycstarter_guide_restaurant.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another reason</a> besides the existing CO that some business owners take the express route of leasing a property that was previously a restaurant. While it&#8217;s not a given everything will be up to code (don’t forget those existing violations), it is easier and cheaper than starting from scratch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39363" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01.jpg" alt="Babeland storefront" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/babeland-retail-commercial-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A retail renovation</a> in Downtown New York by Sweeten contractor <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Checking on a building&#8217;s envelope</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An envelope is building speak for whatever separates the outside from the inside—windows, doors, roof, etc. It’s another area worth looking into before starting your project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessibility for the disabled is often overlooked. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair. While many older buildings may have had their compliance grandfathered in, major commercial renovations could <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2006/rpt/2006-R-0335.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trigger</a> the need for properties to line up with the ADA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other areas that could change the scope of your project include asbestos in window glazing, which would need to be replaced. A property that is a landmark or in a historic district could also <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/lpc/index.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impact</a> if and how you can alter your building’s facade, including doors and windows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What are your facility requirements?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most health codes will require an employer to provide access to toilet facilities. For offices, this could mean a shared bathroom on a floor, according to Hernandez, the expediter. “They have to make sure employees have access to a bathroom from within the building,” she said. One client suggested sending employees to another building, but this was not permitted under the health code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The size of a food establishment will likely determine how many bathrooms are required for patrons (some sort of bathroom access is always required for employees). In 2012, New York City actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/nyregion/rule-shift-cuts-restroom-requirements-at-new-york-restaurants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowered</a> the required bathrooms, permitting small cafes, restaurants, and bars with fewer than 31 seats to have one bathroom, not two. Those with fewer than 20 seats are <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not</a> required to provide a bathroom.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064728861"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>What is a certificate of occupancy?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A certificate of occupancy (CO) is a document that details what someone can legally use a property for, and the limits to which the property can be changed for that use. For example, a CO could state that a property can be used as an office, a private residence, or a restaurant. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Sometimes, it is possible to change a CO to cover a different use, but this can be costly and time-consuming.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064746876"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to renovate a commercial building</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">First, review the certificate of occupancy. This will tell you what you are legally allowed to use the building for (an office space, a residence, a gym, etc.) Then, research whether there are any existing violations on the property. Review the space with an architect or contractor, and check for unpermitted work. Also review the structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work. Will you be able to move walls? Can the current flooring support your business use? Make sure the building’s envelope–the windows, doors, and roof–are in good working condition. Consider people with disabilities. Is there a way for wheelchair users to enter the building? Lastly, understand your facility requirements, like mandatory bathrooms.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27189 size-chrono" title="retail store" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-723x482.jpg" alt="retail renovation cost" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14.jpg 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Designer Rebecca Taylor store&nbsp;project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor David</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening a physical brick-and-mortar store is a bold and energizing step. It’s a chance to create a walk-in version of&nbsp;a business you’ve been&nbsp;growing, or&nbsp;a tangible&nbsp;realization of a long-awaited vision to be your own boss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail renovation costs<span>—</span>for, say, a clothing or beauty boutique, yoga studio or art gallery can slide from pricey to economical&#8230;depending on what you want. Chain Store Age’s annual survey of retail build-outs put the average cost at $56.53 per square foot. If you use that formula, then it will cost $280,000 for a 5,000-square-foot store build-out. In another example, an entrepreneur in Austin, Texas, only spent $7,650 on a build-out for Little Green Beans, a children’s consignment store for clothing and toys, according to <a href="https://www.inc.com/articles/201108/business-start-up-costs-retail-store.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inc.</a>&nbsp;(The business owner&#8217;s breakdown of costs were: $4,000 construction to customize the space, $3,500 for shelves, racks, etc., and a mere $150 for a handyman).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t be too overwhelmed by this figure. As the name suggests, the&nbsp;above survey takes into account bigger stores that are more commonly found in malls than a Main Street space in an older building. A simple build-out for a smaller store<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>minor construction, a coat of paint, shelves, and racks<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>can cost under $10,000. It all depends on the scope of work and what finishes you want.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To figure out this wide world of retail build-out budgets for your project, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractors, offers a few areas to consider.<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<h3><strong>Design for a commercial storefront space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you choose to hire a designer or architect (not everyone does), expect that to take 20 percent of your renovation budget, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Carla</a>. That could mean $40,000 in a $200,000 budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail projects can be as small as custom shelving for storing product, using existing electrical wiring, and&nbsp;applying&nbsp;a fresh coat of paint. With a build-out that basic, you might avoid the need for permits, thus eliminating the need for blueprints to be approved by an architect. However, if you’re serious about optimizing the size of your space and carefully planning the customer experience, then it&#8217;s best to bring in the big guns. “What do you want the customers to experience? What do you want them to see when they first walk in?” said Carla. Then there are the more technical design elements like handicap accessibility and whether or not you need a bathroom. These are best handled by an architect.</p>
<h3><strong>Electrical costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Chain Store Age survey put the cost of interior lighting at $3.30 a square foot. As mentioned above, electrical can be kept simple by using existing wiring and even fixtures to keep these costs down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott, another Sweeten contractor</a>, has worked on retail build-outs where electrical has been as low as $10,000 or as high as $100,000. Splurges in lighting often come from a client wanting specific light fixtures that are in line with their brand. Altering the position of each light to highlight store product or fixing up existing, decrepit wiring could increase your budget for electrical. Once you get into more serious work, your project might also require the additional cost of applying for permits that could also delay your timeline, Scott said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And it isn’t just lighting that needs to be considered. If your business has additional power needs, such as a salon or a dog groomer with equipment like hair dryers, it is best to assess what power burden your ideal store location can handle before signing a lease. That way, you can either find another location or factor in an electrical upgrade into your budget if necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cjJnJjIEXOM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40884 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Plumbing costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p>This area of the budget will largely depend on:</p>
<p>A. Is there is a bathroom?</p>
<p>B. If no, then would you like a bathroom?</p>
<p>C. If you have one, will it stay in the same place?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a bathroom, then it is possible to freshen it up with a coat of paint. If there is no bathroom, you should consider if it will help your business and your staff (otherwise they might have to close the store whenever they need to use a restroom). “You want to keep customers in your store rather than give them a reason to leave,” said Scott, on why a bathroom might help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A very basic bathroom could set you back $3,000 to $6,000, according to <a href="https://home.costhelper.com/bathroom-addition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost Helper</a>. It could attract additional costs if the location is far from water and sewage lines and if you need the help from a structural engineer. A plumbing permit will also be needed. Moving a bathroom will gather similar costs with the added line item of demolition. If your business has unique needs like a washing station for a hair salon, that will be another cost to factor in.</p>
<h3><strong>Flooring and ceiling costs&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a retail build-out, flooring on average takes up $2.76 per square foot in a budget and ceilings take $1.81, according to Chain Store Age. If there are no structural issues with the flooring (again, check your lease to ensure the landlord is responsible for these costs), then what you do to the floors will likely just be cosmetic. If that is the case—you&#8217;re re-varnishing existing floors or laying some tiles—then the project likely won’t require a permit, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin,&nbsp;a Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>HVAC costs in commercial spaces</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of either fixing, replacing or installing an HVAC system costs on average about $2.61 per square foot or about $13,000 for a 5,000-square-foot space. Like everything else, this average can swing in either direction based on what you have, what you want, and what you can afford.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One way to avoid this cost entirely is to negotiate a lease that puts the responsibility of the HVAC system onto the landlord, according to Colin. As an alternative, you can volunteer to take care of the HVAC system and request that the landlord give you three months of free rent. If it is a simple step of replacing the air conditioning unit with something modern, it likely won’t require a permit, said Scott.</p>
<h3><strong>Millwork costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On average, retail build-outs spend almost $10 a square foot on display fixtures or millwork, according to the Chain Store Age survey. That’s roughly 20 percent of an average budget. But of course, it all depends on your vision for your store.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three factors that determine how expensive your displays will be are material, quantity, and what space they need to fit into, Scott said. The cost of simple wood from Home Depot will pale in comparison to teak from Brazil. Spaces, especially older ones, can also have quirks in them that need to be incorporated into the design of your shelving. “There can be a lot of bends and cuts that you have to fit the wood to,” said Scott. “That can consume a lot of time and add more to the cost.”</p>
<h3><strong>Paint costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting to the paint stage means you are close to the finish line. Your walls need to be prepared first, which might be your priciest point, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Another element that will affect your paint budget is if the color is flat, which is generally a better value than a semi-gloss. Also, the darker the color, the more coats of paint you will need, Bill said.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Real-world retail example</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To put things in perspective, here is an actual retail renovation budget for a New York beauty salon from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Paul</a>:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Commercial_reno_budget_retail.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26944 mb-0 size-chrono" title="actual NYC beauty salon renovation estimate / 1,130 sq ft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Commercial_reno_budget_retail-723x533.jpg" alt="retail renovation cost" width="723" height="533"></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening a physical store is an exciting moment for a business. Whether it&#8217;s a simple build-out or one with more moving parts, there&#8217;s a path for you to bring your storefront into the spotlight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">—</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurant renovation costs are hardly a prix fixe situation; they can vary dramatically based on the project. Is it a turnkey situation, where you’re planning to open up in a former restaurant location that already has a kitchen, gas, and electrical? Or are you starting from scratch? The city you’re in will also impact the cost, as will the quality of the finishes and the other professionals you hire for your team. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractor, offers some categories to account for and tips on how to draw up an initial budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.buildingjournal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building Journal</a> puts the national average cost for a 5,000-square-foot restaurant with mid-level finishes at $160 a square foot, or $480,000. This can include the build-out, permits, equipment, and design. That cost is higher if you’re based in an expensive city such as New York ($216 per square foot) or Philadelphia ($180 per square foot). &#8220;We tell chefs in NYC who are typically looking at a 2,000-2,500 sq/ft space for a 50-80 seat restaurant that costs can range from $300-350 per square foot for the front of house and $200 per square foot for the back of house,&#8221; says Jonathan Garnett, the creative director at architectural firm MNDPC. &#8220;Multiply that by the 2,000-square-foot space and you have a ballpark.&#8221; Note that this scope does not include furniture, fixtures or restaurant equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What your food and beverage establishment will cost is unclear until you sit down to develop a budget. Here are elements to seriously consider when pulling together an initial budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46400" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png" alt="find general contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Design for a Restaurant Renovation</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For some, starting a restaurant is a creative endeavor, so they prefer to work closely with their general contractor, architect or designer on the design. Some smaller projects like a cafe might not warrant hiring a restaurant designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s a huge range: Those looking to bring in a designer could pay as little as $25,000 or as much as $400,000 and beyond, according to Jimmy Haber, from <a href="https://e2hospitality.com/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESquared Hospitality</a>, which has a long list of successful restaurant ventures all over the world. <span class="s1">The cost depends on the “celebrity” quotient of the designer, whether the space requires a lot of alterations in order to implement a certain design, or </span><span class="s1">how elaborate the decor will be. </span>A restaurant designer won’t just help with the look and feel of the place, but also the all-important layout. The layout will greatly impact the flow of service from kitchen to patron and your staff’s ability to do their job during busy moments. Bringing in an architect early on in the process will provide cost-effective expertise from start to finish, saving time and headache. Basic services include drawing up schematics and submitting the Certificate of Occupancy, but a full-service architect can provide guidance from project management to various levels of interior design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A designer&#8217;s expertise could also increase the number of seats in the establishment, increasing income in the long run. “By the time you construct and open your restaurant, the mistakes are already there and it is too late,” said Jimmy, on why a designer is worth considering. If you’re big on the creative aspect, then make sure you select a designer who you feel will work within your vision rather than commandeer it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Review the MEPs: mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is critical to do before even renting or buying a space (if you’re at this stage, read our earlier <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>). Perhaps the MEPs are so far gone you will opt for a different venue altogether. Regardless, accessing the MEPs will help you set a realistic budget. For example, a decrepit HVAC system can blow the budget out by tens of thousands of dollars, according to Dan Soloway, a hospitality consultant with Kitchen Options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In big bureaucratic cities like New York, connecting the gas can take months, which is why Jimmy no longer uses gas appliances in his establishment. He only uses electric to save clients from costly delays of connecting gas.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Permits for a Restaurant Renovation</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fitting out a new restaurant or renovating an existing one will rope in a lot of government departments—the fire department, the gas provider, buildings department, etc.—from whatever town or city you’re in. The actual permits can be a low-cost item on a budget (Jimmy estimates less than $5,000), but getting those approved can add substantially to the overall restaurant renovation cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before you sign a lease, always check the <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certificate of occupancy</a> (CO). This will dictate what the space can be used for. If it doesn’t give permission for a food and beverage establishment, changing it could be expensive and time-consuming, or in some cases, impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve checked the CO, Jimmy recommends spending the $25,000 or so to bring in a mechanical engineer, a kitchen consultant, and a lawyer. That team can look over everything from the liquor license (if the location has one, which is ideal) to the MEPs that we mentioned above. If these areas are not up to par, that could delay the approval of your permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What if your location isn&#8217;t already approved for a liquor license? It has become increasingly common for clauses to allow restaurateurs to exit the lease if a liquor license application is denied, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. “That’s because the business might hinge on your ability to sell alcohol,” he said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>General construction</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Floors might still need to be laid and bathrooms built or renovated. A survey of more than 700 responses from the industry publication <a href="https://www.restaurantowner.com/public/Survey-How-Much-Does-it-Cost-to-Open-a-Restaurant.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Restaurant Owner</a> found for a medium restaurant—around 3,200 square feet—construction alone or build-out cost an average $50 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if it is a turnkey restaurant, things like accessibility must be up to current standards, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slavica, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjJnJjIEXOM&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40884 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Equipment</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The restaurant renovation cost of fitting out a bar and kitchen, including all the equipment like burners and espresso machines, can be a big budget line item. The Restaurant Owner’s survey put the average cost of a 1,000-square-foot bar and kitchen, including the equipment, at about $75,000, or $80 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurateurs can buy second-hand equipment, but first, they must do their due diligence. That usually involves spending a few hundred dollars for a technician to look over the equipment before buying it, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. There is also the option to lease equipment, which means a reduced upfront payment, but possibly more in the long run. However, the leasing company normally handles repairs and might even provide things like detergent with a dishwasher.</p>
<h3><b>Rent and labor contingency</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, things can go wrong in a renovation. On average, the Restaurant Owner’s survey found that the overrun on a restaurant remodel budget to be 34 percent. Numerous hurdles can slow down your opening and delay that exciting moment when you make your first sale. Meanwhile, you&#8217;re still paying rent for the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I think your pre-opening rent can be a big wild card. It usually takes much longer to open than you think it does,” said Jimmy, from ESquared Hospitality. A six-month rent contingency can be a business-saver, as is a few months&#8217; contingency for staff costs. Sometimes staff members are already hired—manager, chef, sommelier, etc.—and on the payroll when a delay arises. A labor contingency means you can continue paying them during the delay. Otherwise, they could look for new jobs, which means starting the hiring process from scratch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assessing and writing a restaurant renovation cost plan is like charting a new land—confusing, tedious, and with a few questions marks. However, having a realistic budget can set you up for success while bringing you one step closer to your dream business. Here is a budget breakdown for a 2,000-<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">square-foot</span> <span style="color: #000000;">restaurant in</span> <span style="color: #000000;">New York City by</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Tony</a><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Upgrade a full bath and powder room</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Saira and her husband purchased their East Village duplex with the intention to renovate before moving in. “The two most urgent spaces were the bathrooms,” she said. “They were just very old.” Their style is very clean, minimal, and modern—everything the existing spaces were not. With two young kids, the couple was also worried about having only one full bathroom, which made it even more important to have the spaces updated with new fixtures and better storage options. Equipped with Saira’s Pinterest board for inspiration, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project to Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="bathroom-and-powder-room" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48828 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Saira-Bathroom-Before-2.jpg" alt="View of bathroom and powder room before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Saira-Bathroom-Before-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Saira-Bathroom-Before-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Saira-Bathroom-Before-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />

<em>(Above)</em> The full bathroom</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: With a clear vision in mind, Saira worked with her Sweeten general contractor to bring it to life. The bathrooms share a black-and-white palette and many of the same materials, like the floating wood shelves and industrial light fixtures (which match others throughout the apartment). “I love the contrast of the white tiles with the matte black hardware,” Saira said. They opted for a pedestal sink in the powder room to save on space.</p>
<p>Keeping the design really simple visually and functionally was very important—especially for their children’s safety and their own sanity. The floating vanity in the full bathroom is easier to clean and has just enough room under it for the kids’ step stools, too. “We were very mindful of certain things, like making sure the tile was easy to clean and not too slippery,” Saira said. Their contractor helped pull materials using Saira’s Pinterest board and the couple’s budget as guidelines.</p>

<p>For the most part, Saira communicated with the contracting team via email, receiving pictures of the progress throughout the process. “Our general contractor was always willing to meet at times that were convenient to us,” she said. Fortunately, the project stayed on schedule so the family didn’t have to renew their lease and stay in their rental.</p>
<p>Saira’s parents actually own a real estate business in Toronto, so while she does have remodeling experience, this was her first time doing so in New York City. “Everyone always says renovating is a nightmare, but if you find the right general contractor and you have a good relationship, it can be pretty fun,” she shared.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: The family also had the entire apartment repainted, the floors refinished, and a new closet built by their Sweeten general contractor.</p>

			<h2>Combining two apartments is never easy. See how these families combined spaces.</h2>
<p>Combining two apartments into one home is one of the most time-consuming (and rewarding!) projects in the renovation world. The reason behind the decision varies, but the need is usually the same&#8230; more space. These renovators approached us looking to find vetted <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractors who could <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">merge apartment units</a> to fit their changing lifestyles. Learn more from these NYC apartment combination examples below.</p>

<h3>1. Building a peaceful city oasis</h3>
<p>When this homeowner’s search for a three-bedroom apartment ended in disappointment, he decided to go in another direction. He bought two apartments in an Upper West Side co-op building after consulting the building’s management and an architect, with <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-apartment-combination-with-a-view/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a plan to combine them</a>. Both units were located at the end of a hallway.</p>
<p>Working with his architect and the Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor</a> he hired, he decided to merge them together through their kitchens and replace them with an open kitchen. He also expanded the primary bedroom and bathroom, creating a mini spa with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk-in shower</a>.</p>
<p>A few bumps came up during the project; converting the bathtub into a walk-in shower required raising the floor underneath for the drain pipes in order to meet code and when trying to designate an entryway, they realized the configuration just wasn’t working. He ended up buying additional square footage from the hallway to create a more inviting one. Construction took a total of six months of work. The time, effort, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation costs</a> were well worth it. The homeowner said the apartment, “feels like living in a peaceful oasis above the city.”</p>

<h3>2. Up against a wall</h3>
<p>Zoe had long dreamt of buying and combining apartments, so when she and her husband Arvid felt they had officially <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outgrown their 700-square-foot one-bedroom</a> in Lincoln Square, Manhattan, they took matters into their own hands. After sending letters to neighbors, they learned one was looking to move, and the couple bought their apartment.</p>
<p>The goal was to remove the two existing kitchens and replace them with a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern cook space</a>, plus rip out floors, and create a third bedroom. They learned knocking down walls certainly doesn’t come without challenges. Their contractor came across an unmovable gas riser in a wall they had planned to take down to open up the dining area. Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor assessed the options</a> and had a solution: Make it part of the architecture by designing a partition (pictured above) and creating a dining nook. “Our contractor carefully installed the panel and adjusted the baseboard to make a seamless connection. This graphic panel is now a nice focal point that adds a lot of character,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36557 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg" alt="Combining two apartments gave this couple a spacious kitchen a room to grow their family in the city" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label">(Above) Megan and Zak&#8217;s apartment combination in Manhattan</span></p>
<h3>3. Building one modern, family home</h3>
<p>When Megan and Zak bought a one-bedroom apartment in Carnegie Hill, Manhattan, they hoped the space would work for them and maybe a baby down the line. A year after living in their space, not only did they <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/carnegie-hill-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">realize it needed to be renovated</a>, but also that the apartment really wasn’t big enough for another human (even a tiny one). Luck was on their side as an apartment next door was available.</p>
<p>Once they finalized the sale, the couple started planning to combine the two apartments into one modern, family home. The biggest changes in the overall floorplan included eliminating one kitchen and converting a living room into a primary bathroom. The rest of the renovation focused on <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating an open concept kitchen</a> and living area.</p>
<p>While they did run into a few issues (like discovering pipes in a wall that needed to be rerouted), overall their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation experience went smoothly</a>. “Keeping our eye on the end goal—creating a home we love for us and our baby—made it all worth it. There’s a story and memory behind every material and decision we made. We feel so lucky to live in a space we created for our family,” Megan shared.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Increase storage and counter space in a Queens, NY, kitchen</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Ed, a buyer for a retail department of a major New York City museum, purchased a sponsor apartment with his late wife, Kate, in Jackson Heights, Queens, nearly 16 years ago. (A sponsor unit is a unit or an apartment owned by the original owner or corporation responsible for turning a building from a rental into a co-op.) The kitchen was made up of cheap materials they knew someday they’d want to replace to fit their taste.</p>
<p>“We were pretty enamored by the bungalow/Arts and Crafts/Mission style, given that our building was built around the end of the ‘bungalow boom’ and the neighborhood shared a similar, working middle-class ethos,” Ed said. Otherwise, storage and the lack of counter space were a big issue for them. They came to Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32386" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a>, and were matched with a general contractor.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Ed-Fuqua-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37737 size-full" title="old-patterned-floor-tiles-before-renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Ed-Fuqua-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="two images of kitchen with oak cabinets and overmount stainless steel sink and patterned floor tiles before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Ed-Fuqua-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Ed-Fuqua-Kitchen-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Ed-Fuqua-Kitchen-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: The kitchen came together, capturing the essence of Arts and Crafts style: warm, cherry wood cabinets paired with an earthy green-blue backsplash and natural gray quartz countertops. They moved the fridge to another wall, but otherwise, the layout remained the same. A radiator on the west wall presented a minor design challenge; their contractor suggested working around it by leaving a space open beneath the countertop.</p>
<p>Most of the project went off without a hitch and any issues that popped up were solved quickly (or planned ahead for). When the contractor went to pick up the quartz slab for their counter, he discovered it had been damaged in the warehouse. To keep the renovation on schedule, he texted Ed photos of other, similar options he found. “What we picked actually ended up looking better,” Ed said.</p>
<p>The renovators hoped when they removed the vinyl flooring, the wood underneath would be in good enough shape to keep. It turned out the adhesive used to affix the subfloor ruined the fir floors. Their contractor had thought ahead though, and had a flooring supplier save oak planking just in case. Since they had such a great experience and their contractor handled every issue that popped up, Ed shared he didn’t feel the need to contact Sweeten’s Client Services.&#8221;It speaks very highly of Sweeten’s contractor assessments that nothing came up that need your intervention,” he pointed out.</p>

<h3>Lessons Ed learned post-renovation?</h3>
<p>1.) Have a cleaning crew lined up.<br />
2.) If you’re renovating your kitchen, make sure you have alternative places to have your meals in mind. 3.) Make sure your contractor has multiple suppliers he/she works with. Luckily, theirs did, but that might not always be the case.</p>

<p>While Kate and Ed worked on the plans for their kitchen together, she passed away before she could see it come to fruition. “The kitchen is almost entirely Kate’s conception,” Ed said. “It really feels like I’m living in her vision—it’s really comforting.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A two-family becomes a single home for a couple and their furry friends</h2>
<p><em>Carol and Jon felt as if they’d won the lottery when they found their first home, a charming, two-story detached place—gray with black shutters, built in 1926—on the western edge of Jersey City. While Jon, a lawyer working with startups, and Carol, who does policy work for a national homelessness nonprofit, had great ideas for renovating, they knew this house would be a challenge: It was an up-down duplex and their dream was to turn it into a single-family residence. But with Sweeten&#8217;s help, the renovation turned out great—and was even featured in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/28/couple-crafts-delightful-bunny-mansion-for-their-beloved-pets/">New York Post</a>. </em></p>

<em>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Carol</em></p>
<p>This was the very first house we toured and it had everything we wanted, including a backyard, driveway, and garage. Best of all, it was around the corner from my beloved <em>tia</em> (Spanish for &#8220;aunt&#8221;), so we can have coffee with her every day. We loved our home, but there were challenges: the electrical had to be upgraded and we had to move radiators around to accommodate the kitchen renovation.</p>

<p>With the ultimate goal to make two spaces into one cohesive home, we knew we’d need to save money. So when we first moved in, we made just a few aesthetic changes. We painted the entire space, including the kitchen cabinets, and we had a family friend remove not one, but two drop ceilings in the kitchen. We added a few new light fixtures and fabulous bunny wallpaper from Anthropologie.</p>
<p>We decided to play the role of landlord, living on the first floor of the house with our four rabbits and three cats while we <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/renovate-your-rental-property-wisely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rented out the top floor</a>. We knew that the renovation process would take time, money and patience, but that it would be worth it.</p>

<p>After two years of saving, we were ready to take on the full renovation. We browsed Sweeten&#8217;s Instagram page for inspiration, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27631" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten,</a> and were matched with an amazing contractor. He really helped this not-so-handy couple transform our kitchen into the perfect space to cook and entertain, and prepare the rest of the house for the next renovation phase: turning the house from a double to a single-family home.</p>
<p>During the renovation, we moved into the upstairs unit and lived without a stove with our seven pets, as well as a cat and her two kittens we were fostering for JerseyCats, a local cat rescue. We weren&#8217;t prepared for the renovation to take as long as it did. We started demolition at the end of March and finished early August. Waiting for permits held stuff up a lot. We were sort of over the whole process very quickly. Fortunately, our contractor was always there to help.</p>

Have I mentioned the bunny wallpaper? Early in our relationship, Jon was in law school and I was in graduate school. We thought bunnies would be low-maintenance pets. HA! Now, we can&#8217;t get enough.</p>
<p>We also wanted to increase storage and counter space and create direct access to the backyard through the kitchen.</p>

<p>To enlarge the kitchen, we tore down a wall and took space from an existing bedroom. One of my must-haves was a big kitchen island. I love to cook and host parties for my friends and family, and everyone always ends up in the kitchen. I kept imagining a huge island surrounded by those I love. I really wanted it to be different and for the cabinets underneath (and the lower perimeter cabinets) to be colorful. I&#8217;ve been going through a green phase. I came across swatches of Benjamin Moore Pine Green and was immediately inspired. I’ll admit, I&#8217;m obsessed with the island.</p>

The contractor also created a new door out of an existing window that allowed direct access to the backyard. For more storage, he came up with the double-door pantry, knowing I wanted enough space for my microwave and all of my cooking appliances.</p>

He took charge of redesigning the entry foyer and exposing an existing staircase, which had been hidden behind a wall. Removing that wall and adding a banister made the two-family feel disappear. We are now able to go upstairs without having to go through the foyer.</p>

It&#8217;s such an old house that the panel is in the back of the house, so upgrading it entirely would have been a much larger endeavor.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the renovation was seeing the space transform day to day. One of my favorite moments was walking in and seeing the kitchen gutted to its frame. It was hard to even imagine how beautiful it would turn out. It was exciting and surreal. Despite the delays and being (slightly) over budget, we are in love with our home and would go through it all again.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Refresh an old and outdated bathroom</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Penny, a product manager for a financial firm, and Kevin, a puppeteer with the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre, and their son, have lived in their over 100-year-old-plus co-op building for five years. They’ve been remodeling the Sunset Park, Brooklyn, apartment room by room, and until recently, waited on any major changes to the bathroom. They did, however, replace an old and “hideous” shower door with a curtain for a short-term fix. Once they were ready to bring the dingy space up to speed with their clean, simple style, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor.</a><strong><br />

</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: While they stuck to the original footprint, Penny and Kevin made one big change that had a big impact on the overall look of the bathroom: replacing the bathtub for a walk-in shower. “We spent most of our budget converting the old tub,” Penny shared. They were especially excited about the brand new glass door. A big priority for the couple was sourcing materials locally. When they went to select their wood-like porcelain tile floor at a nearby supplier, they found the light blue and white tiles from the same store. The hardware and major fixtures also come from a Brooklyn showroom close to their home.</p>

The only issue that came up during the renovation was a leak from an apartment upstairs. It was resolved, as the neighbor became more vigilant about making sure water didn’t escape from outside her shower curtain, though if it leaks again, the issue will have to be readdressed.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the biggest challenge was the division of labor between Penny, Kevin, and their contractor—especially since the family was out of town for the majority of the project. The couple divided responsibilities, with Penny taking on the budget and Kevin handling the aesthetic aspects. “He presented me with beautiful designs and then I approved or suggested how we could do things on a budget,” Penny said.</p>
<p>They coordinated with their general contractor mostly via email and phone calls. “His willingness to work with a neighbor, send emails, and call was really helpful,” Penny said. As an experienced renovator, she’s learned to be more trusting of a contractor’s advice, but also that it’s important to speak up about what you’re looking to achieve.  “Be clear on what you want, don’t give up on your design, but be flexible and listen to your contractor. You will be surprised on how that can help—they see a lot.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Penny also added these words of wisdom: “Go with the contractor that listens and seems pleasant to work with,” she said.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Renovating former rental properties to become sources of comfort, instead of income</h2>
<p>No matter how well you take care of a home, things can be damaged accidentally or worn down over time. This is especially true when renovating former rental properties. Especially when tenants move in and out year after year.</p>
<p>Sometimes, homeowners need a break from the stress of renting a property. And sometimes, they&#8217;re ready to hang up their hats as landlords and update their former leasing properties to live in themselves. To take care of the wear and tear and to suit their needs and style, these homeowners turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors. Here are four renovation projects aimed at renovating former rental properties into forever homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35590 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-723x482.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, bathroom renovation, vanity, walnut, open storage, round mirror, convert a rental into a primary residence" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>1.) Outdated Rental Property to Modern Apartment</h3>
<p>Sherry’s family purchased a Midtown East apartment in 2008. While they originally bought it as a rental property, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/millennial-apartment-renovation-midtown-east/">Sherry decided to move in</a> just ten years later. However, it hadn’t been renovated since the ‘80s and had extensive water damage from a previous tenant. Still, the apartment had good bones (and space!). Her remodel involved replacing the flooring in every room. She also completely updated the kitchen and bathrooms to reflect her modern style.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21360 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="convert a rental into primary residence, kitchen, black and white" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>2. Prewar Studio to Charming Apartment</h3>
<p>New York City’s housing market is full of prewar apartments with elaborate features. When Emily moved to the city, she was in search of just that: <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a charming apartment with original details</a>. Her six-month search ended with the purchase of a 1940s studio apartment.</p>
<p>The apartment had long been used as a rental property—and didn&#8217;t reflect its historical roots. She worked with her Sweeten general contractor to restore the apartment to its former glory. They installed beautiful crown molding and paneling throughout.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30008 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="convert a rental into primary residence, bathroom" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>3.) Former Rental Property turned Uptown Retreat</h3>
<p>Ying and her parents’ Upper East Side apartment had seen many lives. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-rental-studio-becomes-a-pied-a-terre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Originally purchased as an investment</a>, the owners and renters had lived in the apartment off and on. After the family hit their co-op’s rental limit, they decided to reimagine the space as a second home. The family added new flooring, paint, lighting, custom built-ins, and an overhauled bathroom.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30242 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-723x482.jpg" alt="convert a rental into primary residence" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>4.) Updated Urban Residence</h3>
<p>After renting out their Manhattan property for over a decade, JoAnn and Brian were ready to call the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-rental-becomes-a-cozy-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">urban residence their permanent home</a>. The couple was leaving behind a six-bedroom house in New Jersey for this mid-town one-bedroom. With that said, they needed an efficient space. That meant an emphasis on storage in the main living areas and bedroom. The kitchen and bathroom had also seen better days. The couple completely redid the two spaces while sticking to the original layout.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Welcome to #15 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a> with any reno questions or dilemmas you’d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: Why should I move out during my renovation? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>The answer is, because you love yourself, and you want to stay healthy. There are so many airborne particles in the air during a renovation, from paint to sometimes, asbestos. We highly recommend that people <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">move out of the space when they&#8217;re gut renovating</a>, although it&#8217;s not necessary for every project or to move out for the entire time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If, for some reason, you can&#8217;t, whether it&#8217;s financial or otherwise, we suggest that you put some kind of vapor barrier between the space where you are living and where the renovation is happening. You want to make sure that you are healthy throughout your entire renovation. Think about it: while someone is demoing, they usually have a mask on and they also leave the property. You don&#8217;t want to be sleeping in a room filled with dust particles. We definitely suggest to at least move out of your space during the dusty demolition phase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>When kids flee the coop, it’s time for change</h2>
<p>Grown children leaving the nest gives parents an opportunity to rethink their lifestyle and their home. For some, that means turning an old bedroom into a gym or office, but for these renovators, it meant tackling kitchens, bathrooms, and living areas to best suit their needs. From a couple looking to downsize to one returning home, learn more about their stories below.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30234 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-723x482.jpg" alt="empty nester remodel, kitchen, living room" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-rental-becomes-a-cozy-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JoAnn and Brian</a> wanted to leave their 4,800-square-foot house in New Jersey to make a one-bedroom they already owned in Manhattan their new home. &#8220;Living in Manhattan had always been a desire. Since we were empty-nesters and our daughter was already living in the city, we decided to renovate our 600-square-foot rental apartment for ourselves,&#8221; they shared. While downscaling by over 4,000-square-feet definitely presented a challenge, a focus on storage in the kitchen and bedroom closets set them up for success.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25237 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg" alt="empty nester remodel, bathroom, renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25235 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-02-723x482.jpg" alt="empty nester remodel, bathroom, renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>The guest bathroom in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/75-year-old-hall-bathroom-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ann and Frank’s</a> three-bedroom apartment was almost all original from 1929. They bought the apartment in 1992, but wanted to wait to renovate until their two kids had left home. Their wish list included having a separate walk-in shower in addition to a new tub. To make room for a walk-in shower, they removed the storage closet next to the door. Otherwise, the footprint remained as is, while new tiles and fixtures contributed to the transformation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33864 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a-723x482.jpg" alt="empty nester remodel, kitchen" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-nyc-homecoming-prompts-a-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Margery and Jim</a> had been waiting for their opportunity to return to New York City. &#8220;Jim and I originally worked in New York and then Jim got transferred. We lived in the suburbs of Philadelphia for about 20 years and then when the kids grew up, we said now&#8217;s our chance to move back to the city, because we&#8217;re really city people,&#8221; Margery shared. They purchased an apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops with incredible views that also needed some work. After living in the apartment for six months, they were ready to remodel. The couple worked with their Sweeten general contractor to bring their industrial-meets-modern vision to life, and take down walls to maximize natural light.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Welcome to #14 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a> with any reno questions or dilemmas you’d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: Should I take the lowest bid? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>The short answer is no. To us, a bid that is significantly lower <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">than all the rest</a> you&#8217;ve received is a red flag. Usually, that means someone has missed something: maybe they didn&#8217;t look at the drawings or don&#8217;t really understand the project. If estimates are all within a certain percentage of each other, you like the person who bid the lowest, you communicate well, and you really love his or her style and craft—absolutely go with them. But just don&#8217;t hire your cousin&#8217;s nephew&#8217;s brother who says he can do it for half the price. We have been called to try to fix that kind of project many times—it often doesn&#8217;t work out well.</p>

<p><em>Not wanting to leave their neighborhood of Inwood in Manhattan, Sandra, a designer </em>and<em> entrepreneur, and her husband Michael, a production manager, searched for a larger home.

<em>Guest blog post by Sandra in Manhattan</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been living in the same 1927 prewar building co-op for about ten years; we love it here. The apartments are well-designed, with the kind of attention to detail (Good closets! Lots of air!) that is a hallmark of prewar design. The neighbors are friendly, the building has a community garden we helped build, and our kids were born in our first apartment here. We didn&#8217;t want to leave, but as the kids got bigger we needed to find more space. With incredible luck, we were able to move to a larger apartment in the same building.</p>
<p>It had the same great bones, but the kitchen had the original layout and cabinets, plus a tiny fridge, no dishwasher, and original hardwood cabinets that were charming, but unfortunately very inefficient. In addition, the kitchen itself was very, very narrow—a definite design challenge.</p>
<p>The dining room was one of the main attractions for us. Meals are the center of our day and family time, and it felt great to have a dedicated space for that—no more having to move the kids&#8217; homework off the table before eating! The room, however, was quite small and almost claustrophobic.</p>
<p>Michael and I work on sustainable design and production at Barnard College and as co-founders of Fixup, a social enterprise repair service, so it was important to us to make thoughtful choices about what we purchased. We met with several contractors and really clicked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten general contractor</a>. He was relaxed, responsive, and a great communicator. His bid was clear and fair, and he definitely understood the challenges and opportunities.</p>

<p>We decided to open an archway between the dining room and the living room to create flow between the main living areas. The opening seemed like such a simple thing, but it totally transformed the apartment. Everything felt more open, and the smallish dining room now felt just right—comfortable for our family of four, but big enough to share with guests. We had the ability to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/sliding-doors-open-world-possibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close off the dining room</a> by adding a pocket door to the kitchen and a partition made of vintage Japanese panels on the other side. This option was so that, someday, if we needed to use it as a bedroom, we still could.</p>
<p>All of the furnishings were purchased used on Aptdeco.com, from the Restoration Hardware table to the new-looking black upholstered chairs. The Japanese sliding door panels and other decorative items were all found at Big Reuse.</p>

<p>We decided to redo the narrow <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/how-to-make-a-galley-kitchen-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley-style kitchen</a> layout entirely, since we often cook together, including the kids. We moved a doorway to add space for a dishwasher and turned the doorway into a pocket (reclaimed) door. Very narrow base cabinets (essentially, wall cabinets) were installed on one side to maximize both floor and counter space and topped with white quartz. Our first choice was to use reclaimed cabinetry from Big Reuse, but with the tight space and the unusual layout, we couldn&#8217;t make it work. We decided to go with Ikea because we felt they offered the best sustainable options and price.</p>

We sanded and stained them and they look great. For the subway tile backsplash, we used leftover tiles already purchased by a friend. So, not quite reclaimed, but at least saved from the landfill. We did splurge on one beautiful panel of decorative tiles, which we set into the backsplash.</p>
<p>One challenge that we weren&#8217;t able to solve perfectly was the refrigerator. With such a narrow kitchen, even a counter-depth refrigerator sticks out too far. Some people in our building actually punched a hole into the dining room to find extra space, but we didn&#8217;t want to compromise that space. And we couldn&#8217;t punch into the other wall because there were electric panels in it. So we decided to just make the best of the size of the fridge.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-12.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37312 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="996" height="1166" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-12.jpg 996w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-12-256x300.jpg 256w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-12-600x702.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /></a></p>
<p>There was only one closet in the master bedroom, so we built out from the wall with two floor-to-ceiling closets, plus a small cabinet over the bathroom doorway. Our contractor&#8217;s carpenter made the custom doors and we found hardware. It was painted to match the existing treatment so the new closets would feel like part of the space.</p>
<p>Sweeten was really helpful in finding the contractor. We met with several, and at first neither the personalities nor the prices seemed right; we felt stuck and sort of gave up for a while. But Sweeten&#8217;s Client Services called me, asked whether we were stalled (and why), and found us another few contractors to talk with—including the one we chose. That type of personalized service was really amazing and helpful.</p>
<p>This was our second kitchen to renovate. The first kitchen we did entirely ourselves, from cabinets to appliances to paint to tiling. It was fun, but that was before kids. This time around, we could barely find time to work on the drawings, much less do the actual work. We knew we needed to work with a great contractor, one who would really collaborate with us, and we got very lucky with ours. Our Sweeten contractor and his team were fantastic. They arrived on time every day, spent time going over every detail on a regular basis, and fixed things as necessary without any problems.</p>
<p>The new kitchen, dining room, and master bedroom closets are wonderful. The dining room is especially a true pleasure. It feels like a real luxury in New York to have a space dedicated to food, family, and friends. The kitchen feels bright and clean, and we were able to design every detail to fit the way we cook, from the special racks for our cast iron pans to a special cabinet (down low) for the kids&#8217; lunch boxes and water bottles. Moving is hard, and it&#8217;s wonderful to feel like our new apartment is now truly home!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Make a bathroom accessible and safe in Brooklyn</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Elaine and her family moved into their brownstone in 1981 and the parlor floor bathroom hadn’t been renovated since. Aside from the outdated fixtures and decor, Elaine’s main focus was to make the bathroom suitable for “aging-in-place.&#8221; The bathroom is on the same floor as the kitchen, so if she ever needed to stay on one floor of the home, she’d have everything she required “My plan is to stay in my house as long as I can,” Elaine said. Design-wise, she wanted the bathroom to be clean, crisp, and something she’d never get tired of. Renovating a bathroom she said, “is like buying a sofa; you’re not just going to get rid of it right away.” When she heard about Sweeten and the selection of vetted, licensed, and insured contractors, Elaine <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27214">posted her project</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brown-tiled-bathroom-with-pink-bathtub"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48856 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="Brown tiled bathroom with pink bathtub before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Elaine was matched with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4018">Sweeten general contractor</a> and they clicked instantly. “I could sense that I got along with him very well,” she said. They went to Home Depot together, and he suggested a few stores in Queens with better prices for fixtures and materials.</p>
<p>The bathtub was replaced with a walk-in shower featuring a handicap bar, a separate hand-shower, and a built-in storage nook. Elaine knew she wanted the shower floor to be a little rougher for extra traction, so she opted for a stone-effect material. Even though the bathroom had plenty of space for a separate towel rack, she preferred a clean, clutter-free space with essentials hidden away. The floating vanity provided enough storage for towels, toilet paper, and a hairdryer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="recessed-shower-shelf-with-stone-effect"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48860 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="Recessed shower shelf with stone effect in a white bathroom after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<img decoding="async" title="white-walk-in-shower-area-stone-effect"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48862 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="White walk in shower area with stone effect flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-glass-doors"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48858 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="White bathroom with glass doors and white floating sink and vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Overall, the renovation process went smoothly. When she ordered the wrong size toilet for the existing plumbing, her contractor helped find a new one for the plumbing. Since there weren’t any major changes to the footprint, they didn’t have to go through the NYC Department of Buildings for approvals, either.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-french-window-behind-homeowner"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48869 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="White french windows behind a happy homeowner " width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>“I was very fortunate I found the right person through Sweeten,” Elaine said. “I love everything about the bathroom.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Her contractor built a closet for even more convenient (and hidden) storage.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>:  Shower tile, shower fixtures, wall and floor tile, and floating vanity: <a href="https://www.decorplanet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decor Planet</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Manhattan home renovates with the right materials and storage</h2>
<p><em>Christina had wanted to remodel her circa 1959 studio co-op in Murray Hill for the five years she’d been living in it. The kitchen and the bathroom were dated, lacked storage space, and were poorly lit. Each year, she&#8217;d revisit the idea of remodeling—even meeting with contractors—but the timing never seemed right between personal and professional commitments (she&#8217;s a financial executive). Hearing so many renovation horror stories also made her hesitate. She discovered <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and took the big step forward. Christina <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27878">posted her project,</a> was matched <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractors</a> and made her selection. Here, she tells her story.</em></p>

<em>Guest post by Christina in Manhattan</em></p>
<p>Putting all my renovation fears aside, I felt my 550-square-foot studio space was not an accurate reflection of my style. The kitchen and bathroom were not well thought out, and the apartment really lacked adequate storage space. For the kitchen, I just used to ignore it by avoiding it altogether, but I couldn’t keep doing that. When I finally met the right contractor through the help of Sweeten, I felt the time had arrived to move forward with updating the space.</p>

<p>Even though it was the kitchen and bath renovations that drove me to get started, there were other things that needed updating. The walls were slightly bumpy in some areas, so I had them <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim-coated</a> [spreading a thin coat of joint compound or &#8220;mud&#8221; on the wall, and then scraping it away to leave a smooth layer] to make everything look as sleek as possible. Also as an artist, I have several of my oil paintings hanging throughout the apartment, so the walls were not all that noticeable, but <span style="color: #000000;">once you update one thing, the flaws in other areas really start to show.</span> Although not part of the original plan, the floors were changed. Upgrading the weak lighting was also a high priority.</p>
<p>My vision for the whole apartment was to look serene, timeless, and glamorous—without overdoing it. I wanted to keep things relatively neutral because my artwork adds pops of color; I didn’t want to create additional “noise.”</p>

<p>The small kitchen didn’t support the existing full-size appliances and was awkward to move around in. The refrigerator was too big and the kitchen lacked counter space, mostly due to a huge sink. That was the number one thing I wanted to correct. With little room to put anything (six inches of usable workspace), I ended up using a foldable table hung on the wall. I could not wait to remove that! The cabinets did not go up to the ceiling—another waste of a significant amount of space that could have been used for storage. The overall configuration became more efficient with a smaller sink and new ceiling-height cabinets. Mission accomplished!</p>

<p>In the bathroom, there was an old pedestal-style sink, leaving no storage space underneath. I have a ton of stuff and am also a neat freak, so I needed all the storage space I could get. I love mirrors that double as storage and insisted on having a larger medicine cabinet. This was a challenge because we had building pipes running behind where the cabinet would be fastened. We found a solution by combining two different-sized ones together; it looks amazing. In both the kitchen and bathroom, I paired Calacatta marble with wood-looking floor tiles for continuity. I knew that was the look I wanted even before shopping for materials. My contractor played an integral role in selecting the materials, offering a lot of ideas on what would look good and what might not work. He also helped <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customize the kitchen cabinets</a>.</p>
<p>I admit I have expensive taste, and sometimes I got carried away with wanting very high-end materials. My contractor helped me stay on track and we found a lot of reasonably priced options at Home Depot for things like light fixtures.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36979 mb-0 size-chrono" title="photo-of-christina-behind-chair" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-01-723x482.jpg" alt="photo of christina standing behind a chair after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>The original floors were damaged by water from a pipe bursting. I wanted a high contrast between the floors and walls and couldn’t believe what a huge difference it gave to the look and vibe of the apartment. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproof layer</a> was included per the building’s request. The entire removal and installation was surprisingly a relatively fast process.</p>
<p>I was most excited about redoing the kitchen; that was the area that bothered me the most. The thought of having everything finally the way I wanted it (within the constraints of the building requirements and existing structure) made me very happy. I was also really excited to be involved in every aspect of the project and learning about construction in Manhattan. After investing a lot of time and energy into the new finishes and design, I feel a greater sense of emotional ownership towards everything in my home. I&#8217;ve been traveling a lot lately, but I can&#8217;t wait to leverage the new appliances and kitchen to their full potential.</p>
<p>The space is now an accurate reflection of my style and personality. It makes me feel at peace and happy to come home every day knowing every single thing is exactly how I wanted it. I feel a great sense of pride in the final product.</p>
