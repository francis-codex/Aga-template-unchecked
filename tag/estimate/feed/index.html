			<h2>4 advantages of getting multiple estimates for your remodel</h2>
<h3><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="workers-remodelling-living-room" class="alignnone wp-image-50479 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/competitive-bidding-cover_jane-living-room-03.jpg" alt="workers remodelling a living room during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/competitive-bidding-cover_jane-living-room-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/competitive-bidding-cover_jane-living-room-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/competitive-bidding-cover_jane-living-room-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<p>Competitive bidding means inviting three to five general contractors to submit an estimate, or bid, for your remodeling project. Then, after carefully comparing the bids, you can hire the right contractor with confidence.</p>
<p>This is standard practice in the wider world of construction. At Sweeten, our roots are in the construction industry—our founders are trained architects—and we believe competitive bidding is the ideal approach to planning home renovations. We suggest you ask for bids from at least 3 general contractors before hiring one. When it comes to getting estimates for your remodel, having multiple options gives you more flexibility and choice.</p>
<p>Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Competitive bidding empowers you to:</h3>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Know you’re getting <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/qa-with-jean-should-i-take-the-lowest-bid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a highly competitive price</a></li>
<li aria-level="1">Know you’re getting the specific services you need</li>
<li aria-level="1">Compare contractors’ design ideas and solutions</li>
<li aria-level="1">Compare contractors’ communication styles and personalities</li>
</ol>
<p>You’ll feel assured that you’ve chosen the right contractor, that you’re getting the right services, and that you’ve been quoted the right price. It’s a magical way to find peace of mind, without any second-guessing.</p>
<h3>How the bidding process works at Sweeten</h3>
<h4>Sweeten is the only renovation service that actively supports competitive bidding. It’s baked into our process from the start. With Sweeten you’ll get:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A list of recommended, trusted contractors who are perfectly matched to your renovation. You can pick your favorites and invite them to bid on your project with a single click. Every general contractor we match you with will be well-qualified for the kind of renovation you&#8217;re planning, your budget range, and the design services you need. You get to choose based on the intangibles, like whether you prefer to work with a large or small company, which contractor’s portfolio projects you prefer, and you find easiest to communicate with.</li>
<li>Messaging tools available right in your Sweeten dashboard, to make setting up site visits simple and fast. We also include a video chat feature, so contractors can meet with you remotely, to save time and maintain social distancing.</li>
<li>A free bid-leveling call with one of our renovation specialists, to help you understand your bids—and get inside information on the individual contractors. This invaluable service helps you see the big picture make the most informed choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the bid-leveling call, we encourage you to ask anything, whether about your renovation, the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractors bidding</a> on your project, or the Sweeten process.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Here on the Sweeten blog, we’ve previously discussed <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leveling bids</a>, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/prep-bid-remodel-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing for bids</a>, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">site visits</a>. Soliciting and comparing bids is one of the first steps of a home renovation project, and it can be daunting to figure out the best way to go about it. At this point, one of your major considerations is likely the budget: how much do you need to spend to get the results you want, and where does the money go? Many homeowners (myself included!) have been tempted to go with labor-only bids from contractors in an attempt to lower costs. Let’s take a look at the pros and cons of labor-only bids versus all-inclusive bids.</p>
<h3>Understanding the difference</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a <strong>labor-only bid</strong>, contractors will identify the labor costs associated with various parts of your project. For example, their bids will include line items such as demolition and installation related to various aspects of your project. We’ve included a sample labor-only bid for an apartment kitchen update in a condo building in the box below. This real-life example is of a 125-square-foot kitchen in Brooklyn, where the Sweeten homeowner was changing out many of the finishes in her kitchen but retaining the existing appliances since they were just a couple years old. She also kept the lower cabinets to create a dual-tone look.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/labor-budget.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26627 mb-0 size-chrono" title="labor-only bid example" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/labor-budget-723x271.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="271" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s take a look now at an <strong>all-inclusive bid</strong> for the same kitchen:</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/allinclusive-budget.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26628 mb-0 size-chrono" title="all-inclusive bid example" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/allinclusive-budget-723x338.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="338" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/allinclusive-budget-723x338.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/allinclusive-budget-300x140.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/allinclusive-budget-600x281.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/allinclusive-budget.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Which is right for you?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bids are very different, but keep in mind the labor-only bid does not include the cost of materials, which you’d still need to account for separately. Let’s break down the difference between the two scenarios.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The truth about material costs</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest differences in price come from the cabinets and countertops (the materials themselves): the new cabinetry comes out to $5,900 and the quartz countertops $5,400. (Since the cabinetry installation for custom work is less labor intensive than assembling and installing modular cabinetry, the labor costs are actually lower on the all-inclusive bid. And because countertop suppliers usually throw in installation as part of the quoted cost, we don’t account for it separately in the labor-only bid.) The question is whether you can find better prices than your contractor. General contractors have partnerships with suppliers and wholesalers that allow them to obtain materials and parts at lower prices, which they can pass onto you. While there will be a markup for their time and effort, the final number may come out fairly close to what you would find on your own.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another note: If you plan to go with <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom cabinets</a>, they will cost more no matter whether you source them from an independent millworker or go through your contractor. Similarly, there are pricing variations on <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countertops</a>, but they should generally be in the same range.    </span></p>
<h3>How much time do you have?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aside from the comparison of the cost of materials, the other major consideration is time. Managing a home renovation can be as time intensive as a job, and labor-only contracts require even more from homeowners in terms of preparation, research, and project coordination than all-inclusive bids. This is because you, as the homeowner, are the de facto project manager, having only delegated part of the job to your contractor. You are still responsible for making decisions on materials, as well as sourcing and coordinating the delivery of all materials to the work site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on the size of the job, this can get very complicated. Some homeowners have shared that significant delays have resulted due to their own miscalculations or oversight about product delivery lead times. This is why some contractors strongly advise/request you let them handle the ordering and delivery logistics. While an all-inclusive bid does not guarantee that there will be no delays, it’s the contractor’s responsibility in that scenario to ensure that all materials arrive in time for each step in the process. As professionals, they are accustomed to all the steps and what needs to arrive when for the project to be completed on time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, while the total price of an all-inclusive bid may look overwhelming at first, it is important to understand what goes into it and assess whether it will save you an enormous amount of time, hassle, and frustration. Centralizing the responsibility with your contractor also makes the process more straightforward. Lastly, to make the decision simple, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<p>*Are you very organized?</p>
<p>*Do you have a lot of time to spend on this renovation project?</p>
<p>*Do you already have very specific ideas about where to source fixtures, tiles, and other materials? (E.g., you already have your eye on those Schoolhouse Electric pendants and have decided on a full <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-kitchen-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA kitchen</a> suite.)</p>
<p>*Are you a designer or have industry connections?</p>
<p>*Is the bottom line the most important thing?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you answered &#8220;yes&#8221; to all of these questions, you may be equipped to tackle a labor-only bid. If you answered &#8220;no&#8221; to any of them, however, an all-inclusive bid is your best bet for a smooth, turnkey home renovation experience.</p>

<h3>Moving forward with top contractor choices</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Sweeten, we know a lot about general contractors. One frequent question from homeowners involves how to prepare for a general contractor meeting. Site visits assess if a pro will be a good fit and to also secure the most precise estimate possible for the project.</p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">We recommend:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">reviewing three expert profiles that Sweeten matches you with</span></li>
<li class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">having at least three phone calls and site visits with the matches</span></li>
<li class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">requesting three estimates so you can make an informed decision</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">A phone call to discuss the project before the site visit may save you valuable time. It&#8217;s a good first introduction and gauges whether you&#8217;re both on the same page.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—</span>for free.</p>
<h4>Why it&#8217;s important to meet general contractors on-site</h4>
<p>Site visits are one of the first steps in a renovation. The meeting lasts 60–90 minutes on average and gives you a chance to interview experts who will help you get the job done. More importantly, it checks whether there&#8217;s chemistry and good communication between you and the contractor.</p>
<p>While Sweeten simplifies the search by matching vetted and licensed professionals to your project, you&#8217;ll still want to make an informed decision by having an in-person meeting. The visits should be with one contractor at a time. As you begin to schedule visits and solicit bids, here are a few ways you can prepare for a successful meeting with potential general contractors.

You may request that bids include ways to remove items from the latter category if the budget is going over. Be specific about how you plan to use the new space, and how the old space falls short. If you need more storage, be specific about what you want to store there. Sharing this information with your contractor will help them create tailored solutions for you. If you are unsure of your end goals, let the contractor know. This will establish that you are looking for guidance, and the contractor can advise accordingly or suggest a designer or other expert to work in tandem with you.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Budget</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: Reiterate your budget so that the contractor can keep it in mind while discussing options. For example, this will affect whether they suggest custom or stock cabinets. You can also specify a labor versus material budget. If you plan to apply for a loan to finance your project, mention this upfront since it’ll add time to your project. At the end of your meeting, ask when you can expect an estimate.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Inspiration photos</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: One of the best ways for a contractor to get a sense of your vision is to provide a Pinterest page, photos on your phone, or magazine tearsheets.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Plans and sketches</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: If you have these, provide them. Even if it’s a rough sketch you did by hand on scrap paper, it can help the contractor understand your vision. If you did them in SketchUp or had an architect draw renderings already, have them ready.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Division of labor</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: Who will do what? If you plan to source the materials yourself, make that clear so that the expert does not include those estimates in the bid. Should you need a designer, an expediter, a project manager, or custom millwork, discuss who will be responsible for securing those services and whether they will be included. If you don’t yet know, make a point to discuss these options with the contractor.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>House rules and alteration agreement</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: If you live in a condo or a co-op building, ask your management company for these documents. Review them with or prior to meeting the contractor. Restrictions on working hours and building requirements can often affect the budget. Some co-op boards will not work with specific insurance carriers so <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check with your board</a>. Share this with the contractor prior to the site visit. You want to be sure that your top contractor choices can work in your building. </span></p>
<h3>How to prepare for a general contractor meeting</h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Questions for a general contractor</span></h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Keep in mind that many factors go into a smooth working relationship. Understanding as much as you can about the contractor’s experience, and how they work, is crucial. Try to have</span><span class="s1"> all decision makers present during the site visit. This will ensure that everyone is on the same page. </span><span class="s1">The following are examples of questions to ask: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">How often will they be on-site? </span><span class="s2">Who will oversee the work on a daily basis?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does the contractor take clients shopping for materials or provide shopping resources?<br />
</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">How often do they meet with clients to discuss the project&#8217;s progress?<br />
</span></li>
<li>Will the contractor send progress reports via email or by phone, and how often? If you have a preference, let them know this.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">How do they approach problems during an emergency? If a pipe should burst, what is the protocol?<br />
</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">What is the best way to reach them?<br />
</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ask for an estimate. The length of time to receive it depends on the size of the scope. Ask them what the ETA is for the estimate. An estimate for a one-room project that&#8217;s straightforward should take one week, while a gut renovation of a townhouse may take a month.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ask for references or read contractors&#8217; reviews on our site. For bigger projects, a contractor may take you on a walk-through of a project they completed for a past client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other topics to bring up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss with the contractor if you and your family plan on living/working in the space during the renovation. What will this arrangement look like?</li>
<li>Share any important dates that affect the completion date, such as family coming to visit. Will the project be completed by then? If not, what is the plan?</li>
<li>Inquire how the contractor&#8217;s company is set up. Do they have more than one project happening at once?</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Communication is key</span></h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Like all great matches, there is a lot that can’t be determined on paper. Face-to-face meetings are not only an opportunity for the contractors to get a sense of the scope of your project and the actual site conditions but also for you to get to know them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two of you will be working closely together for the duration of the project. It’s important that you feel the contractor understands where you are coming from and the vision you want to execute. Having a contractor who&#8217;s had similar experiences in handling the scope you are presenting is more important than whether they&#8217;ve done work in your neighborhood. How to prepare for a general contractor meeting also includes listening to your “gut feeling.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your site visit is a chance to interview an individual who will become a key part of your life for the next few weeks to months. You will rely on them to make decisions when you’re not available, but also to know when a discussion is necessary before taking action. So consider these questions as you’re getting to know the contractor during the site visit:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does this person communicate clearly and effectively?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Do they have a clear understanding of what I need, and can they provide it?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Do I feel supported in my decision-making?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does it seem like the contractor will be responsive and organized throughout the process?</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Schedule a bid-leveling call</span></h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">After the walk-through, take the time to sit down and debrief. If you go over the full scope of the work and ask for the contractor&#8217;s feedback on your ideas, this will create a firm foundation for working together.</span></p>
<p>When all estimates are in hand, schedule a one-on-one <a href="https://sweeten.com/bid-leveling-call-for-renovation-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid leveling call</a> with Sweeten to help compare them. Estimates are not universal and can differ in terminology, organization, and basic assumptions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">The cost to paint the interior of a home depends on the complexity of the project</h2>
<h2 class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23909 mb-0 size-chrono" title="beige-kitchen-yellow-wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-723x510.jpg" alt="beige kitchen with yellow highlight wall and white kitchen cabinets after renovation" width="723" height="510" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-723x510.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-300x212.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-600x424.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are pretty good that you’ve painted your walls before. Interior painting is a project that many are willing to tackle solo, and the prospect of a DIY job can be tempting given that the outlay is just the cost of paint and some inexpensive tools. But going pro is often the right choice, with real costs and real benefits, especially when painting is part of a more ambitious home renovation. Let’s take a look at why there are such wide variations in cost, and how to decide who is right for the job.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br /></a><b>Costs for painting by the gallon &amp; necessary equipment</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many options for paint, but tried and true staples such as <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Moore</a>, <a href="https://www.behr.com/consumer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behr</a>, <a href="https://www.askval.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valspar</a>, and <a href="https://www.sherwin-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sherwin Williams</a> are all available at your local hardware store or a big box store like Home Depot or Lowe’s. By the gallon, these brands rarely exceed $50 and usually average around $30, depending on the specifics. You can also go upscale with a luxury paint like Farrow &amp; Ball, where a gallon will run you $100, or <a href="https://www.finepaintsofeurope.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fine Paints of Europe</a>, at approximately $110 a gallon. Additionally, you’ll probably need to pay for primer, which averages around the same cost as paint. The rest of the supplies—rollers, extenders, brushes, trays/pans, and paper or tarp—will represent a small percentage of your total budget. For example, a brush costs a few dollars at any local hardware store, and a 36” x 900’ roll of brown paper costs $39 at Home Depot (enough for a very large paint job.)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Variables that&#8217;ll impact costs to paint a home&#8217;s interior </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here’s where it gets more complicated: like most other types of renovation work, painting is very site-specific. This means that all the charming idiosyncrasies of your prewar apartment (e.g., the crown moldings, prized paneling, that curved hallway wall) translate into higher painting costs. Many experts will refuse to provide a bid without a site visit, and with good reason. They need to make a visual assessment of the condition of the walls and surroundings before providing a competitive estimate. They will want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What condition are the walls in and how much prep will be required?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How high are the ceilings, what are the specific dimensions of the surfaces, and how much trim detail is there?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the quality of work in the rest of the apartment? (This helps them assess where to land on the spectrum of “rental grade” to “luxury” in terms of the finished product.)</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there furniture to work around? How much of it?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there lead present in the existing paint?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the building restrictions on construction work?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where is the site?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23910 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-highlight-wall-breakfast-nook" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-723x1083.jpg" alt="blue highlight wall in a breakfast nook with dining table and hanging pendant lights after renovation " width="723" height="1083" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-723x1083.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Painters use all of this information to assess how many labor hours the job will require. For example, they take into account how much commuting time will be required, and how long a day they will be allowed to work. They think about whether they’ll have to circle the block and monitor a meter, or if they can just park in your driveway. And, they note how much prep will be necessary, in addition to the actual painting time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One other variable to keep in mind is that small projects tend to offer less bang for your buck because there is some time that elapses between steps. For example, if your project is limited to one bedroom, there isn’t anything else the workers can do while they are waiting for the primer to dry, whereas if your project includes more rooms, they can alternate working in different spaces. For a small project, you end up paying for the whole day anyway, because waiting becomes part of the job.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Labor costs for painting </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, painters are often willing to provide their per-hour rate to clients, unlike general contractors or millworkers, whose projects are not as easily broken down into an hourly rate. This means that once you know the per-hour rate that your painter charges, and how many hours the job will take, there is very little mystery to how your project will be billed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While hourly labor rates do vary, they typically start at about $25 to $30 per hour on the low end and average around $50 to $60 per hour for an experienced painter (not a huge range.)</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Preparation before interior painting walls</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The real disparity in painting costs arise because of the amount of time spent on prep. Prep work is what makes the difference between a rental-grade finished product and a high-end, luxury one. Perfectly smooth walls and incisive clean lines are difficult (and thus expensive) to come by, so it is often just a question of how much imperfection a homeowner is willing to live with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If one painter provides a $5,000 bid for a project while another painter bids $3,000, most of the difference will be in the amount of prep. The higher bid will probably involve carefully “raking” the walls (a process that involves darkening the room and using a small spotlight to highlight problem spots), systematically repairing all the spots, applying and sanding down compound, and then a thorough cleaning of all the surfaces to ensure maximum paint adhesion. The lower bid will likely skip over some of these steps to reduce labor hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unsurprisingly, detail work takes a lot of prep. Taping and prep steps double as soon as you introduce a line of molding in a contrasting color, and trim details are critical focal points so your design choices and architectural details will come into play in determining project timeline and cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many renovators have also wondered about skim-coating, a particularly time-intensive (and thus costly) aspect of prep work. Skim-coating is a process in which you smooth out the wall by rolling thinned-out, all-purpose joint compound (“mud”) on the walls, and then immediately smooth it out with a knife edge. Because the mud dries quickly, it can only be applied in small patches. And each layer is thin, so it may require multiple layers to even out very bumpy or textured walls. Although it sounds relatively simple, it requires skill and experience to do well. As a result, skim-coating is billed separately, and at a higher rate (roughly $10 to $20 more expensive than painting by the hour), and will also take more time than the painting itself. That combination of a higher hourly rate and more time needed for skim-coating can easily double the cost of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Skim-coating is a big undertaking. If you’re on the fence about whether your walls need it, you might compromise by focusing on areas that are well lit (where defects are easy to see) or in rooms that you plan to paint with a gloss or semi-gloss paint (these finishes tend to magnify imperfections). You might decide that a very visible wall that gets lots of natural light needs the full treatment, while walls that aren’t quite as prominent or immediately visible upon entry get a bit less focus. Pause in each room and think about where your eye hits when you walk in and out and when you are naturally using the room. You may find that only one out of four walls really needs the re-surfacing that skim-coating provides.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And lastly, if there is lead paint detected in your home, there are additional steps that workers must take to contain dust. Painters will need to ensure special staging of the work site with plastic tarp, and use special vacuums that do not recirculate dust into the air. Again, more time spent prepping equals more money.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review surfaces and walls before beginning to paint </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a homeowner, you can start by assessing the condition and complexity of the space, and think through how much prep and perfection you want to include in your budget. An empty room with walls in decent condition might just need one to two painters over one to two days of work to get a fresh coat up, whereas an entire home with varied surfaces and heavy furniture will require a full team working over the course of two weeks or more to prep, paint, and finish across a variety of spaces.</p>
