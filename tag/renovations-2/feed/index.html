										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Accessible bathroom renovation projects make homes safe now and in the future</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no doubting the charm of old apartments and homes. Unfortunately, many of them lack an essential quality found in more modern buildings: accessibility. At Sweeten, we’ve seen an uptick in renovators specifically asking for accessible bathroom renovation. From requests like adding higher toilets to safety bars, modern homeowners are prioritizing the safety of their loved ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These four bathroom renovations, all completed by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> general contractors, highlight how to update older spaces to make them more comfortable and secure. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>1. Future planning</h3>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Elaine-Hellew-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37098 mb-0 size-full" title="taupe-walls-and floor-tiles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Elaine-Hellew-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="floating bathroom vanity with mirror and taupe walls and floor tiles and walk-in shower with glass wall and mosaic floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Elaine-Hellew-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Elaine-Hellew-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Elaine-Hellew-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elaine’s multi-floor Brooklyn brownstone was designed before accessibility was top of mind. Thinking of the future, Elaine wanted to create a first-floor living space so she wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about climbing stairs. She decided to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/brooklyn-bathroom-staying-in-place-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update a bathroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (that hadn’t been renovated since the ‘80s) on the first floor, where there’s also a kitchen. The bathtub was replaced with a walk-in shower, complete with a handicap bar and handheld shower. It also has a stone-effect floor to help prevent slipping.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>2. Shower safety</h3>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Debbie-Francis-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35840 mb-0 size-full" title="accessible bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Debbie-Francis-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Complete with a shower seat and handheld shower head, this accessible bathroom renovation makes it safe and easy for anyone with limited mobility" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Debbie-Francis-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Debbie-Francis-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Debbie-Francis-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two subpar bathrooms are definitely not better than one great one. Debbie helped her father move out of his two-story home into a co-op in the Bronx that was </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/elderly-senior-friendly-bathroom-the-bronx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more safe and accessible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for using his wheelchair or walker. However, the bathrooms were not working for his needs. After matching with a Sweeten general contractor, Debbie combined the two spaces into a single bathroom with a low-curbed shower, a shower seat, and safety bars.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>3. Ground floor bathroom addition</h3>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35991 mb-0 size-full" title="shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="This curbless shower makes it easy to access for wheel-chair or walker-bound individuals" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sisters in Queens approached Sweeten about turning an unused room into an </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/senior-friendly-bathroom-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">entirely new first-floor bathroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their mother. After demolishing, reframing, and equipping the space for plumbing, the family chose fixtures and made design decisions. A curbless shower is large enough to fit a shower chair and makes for easier entry. The toilet measures in at 17-inches high, aligning with ADA-compliant standards. </span></p>
<h3></h3>
<hr />
<h3>4. &#8220;Aging-in-place&#8221; oasis</h3>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35033 mb-0 size-full" title="light-tiled-bathroom-with-mirror" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19.jpg" alt="light tiled bathroom with large mirror and shower glass for walk in shower area after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Marie and John moved back to their native New York City, they wanted a home that could both accommodate large family gatherings and be an </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brooklyn-grandparents-renovate-kensington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“aging-in-place” oasis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For this accessible bathroom renovation, their Sweeten architect focused on choosing materials and design elements that were easy to maintain throughout the home. This included heat-resistant countertops in the kitchen and large-scale bath tiles that required less grout in the bathroom. Replacing the bathtub for a walk-in shower was high on the list of priorities too.</span></p>

<p>On <em>The Today Show&#8217;s</em> &#8220;Meet the Boss&#8221; series, <a href="https://www.today.com/video/this-woman-built-a-multimillion-dollar-company-in-her-own-backyard-1183478339854" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Savannah Guthrie interviews Sweeten founder and CEO</a>, Jean Brownhill, on founding the renovation platform that matches general contractors with prospective renovators (and offers some advice to entrepreneurs, too.) This originally aired March 12, 2018.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:00</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">All this week we&#8217;re going to share some inspiring stories of accomplished women we admire, who dream big. We&#8217;re hoping it might inspire some of you out there, might have a good idea. First up today, a CEO who went from barely scraping by to crushing it. Jean Brownhill builds a home renovation referral company from the ground up in her own backyard and turned it into a multimillion-dollar business.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean Brownhill:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:21</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Here we are.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:22</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Wow.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean Brownhill:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:23</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Sweeten is like home sweet home. That feeling of having a space in the world that we feel comfortable, safe and it&#8217;s home.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:33</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">In a big picture sense, your business is helping people make their homes a little sweeter.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean Brownhill:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:38</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:39</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Jean Brownhill is the founder and CEO of Sweeten, a company that matches homeowners with contractors for their renovation.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:47</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">A lot of people look around their space they live in. They think I would like it to look better, but they&#8217;re totally overwhelmed by the process.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean Brownhill</strong> (<span class="s1">00:55</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Yes.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s2">00</span><span class="s1">:55</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Is that where you come in?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean Brownhill:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:56</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Exactly. We have done thousands of renovations at this point.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:01</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">In 2007, Jean, a trained architect, began renovations on her own first home. You probably thought, I&#8217;m made for this. I&#8217;m an architect.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean Brownhill:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:10</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Yes. I was like this&#8230;I got this. Well, come to find out I didn&#8217;t. I ended up hiring the wrong general contractor.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:16</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Even you did that?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean Brownhill:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:17</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Even I did it. I just thought, there&#8217;s got to be a better way and I have an idea how to do it.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:23</span>)</p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #333333;">When the light bulb went off.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean Brownhill:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:24</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">It was a classic entrepreneurial moment where I was like&#8230;I know how to solve this.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:30</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">On Sweeten&#8217;s website, homeowners complete a form about their renovation. They&#8217;re matched with three contractors. They can choose who is right for their renovation project.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean Brownhill:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:40</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">We then follow your project from that starting point all the way to completion. We make sure that our guys are doing a great job. You get to actually give them a rating. The great thing about it is we can do it all for free for the homeowner. The general contractors pay us a small fee.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:57</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Some people call you &#8220;The Contractor Whisperer.&#8221; What does that mean, the contractor whisperer?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean Brownhill:</strong> (<span class="s1">02:02</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">I love that name. I am an unlikely champion for general contractors. Let&#8217;s be honest, I&#8217;m naturally inclined to want to defend people who have been painted with a negative and broad brushstroke, and general contractors have.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">02:19</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Jean grew up in New London, Connecticut. From the earliest age learns that no job is too small.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean Brownhill:</strong> (<span class="s1">02:25</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">I was that kid who, was scooping ice cream, delivering newspapers. I had babysitting jobs. I always loved to draw, I loved to build stuff. My guidance counselor said, &#8220;Oh, you should be an architect.&#8221; I have no idea what that meant. No one in my family had ever used an architect.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">02:41</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Her determination and drive come from her family.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean Brownhill:</strong> (<span class="s1">02:44</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">My dad&#8217;s mom, grew up in the South, African-American woman who was a domestic worker. Who could never have the time or the luxury to have any education. She couldn&#8217;t read or write. Her whole life I watched sign her name with an X. Every moment where I feel like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m tired, this is like too much.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, come on.&#8221; You&#8217;ll see they&#8217;re putting the bathroom back here&#8230;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">03:09</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Jean&#8217;s hard work has paid off. Sweeten currently has $900 million in construction projects. What&#8217;s your advice to people who have an idea or dream of owning their own business or have that entrepreneurial moment? What would you tell them?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean Brownhill:</strong> (<span class="s1">03:25</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">I have two pieces of advice. Don&#8217;t quit and keep smiling. I&#8217;m a person who believes, &#8220;The more that you feel blessed, the more blessings you get.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">03:35</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">What do you think makes a good boss?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean Brownhill:</strong> (<span class="s1">03:37</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">One of the things I&#8217;ve definitely learned the most out of this whole experience is that, you can only be yourself. I can just be the best that I can be. I&#8217;m just encouraging people to be the best them. That&#8217;s the best thing that I can do as a boss is encourage people to do that.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">03:57</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Pretty cool, right?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Al Roker:</strong> (<span class="s1">03:58</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">She&#8217;s so smart.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Hoda Kotb:</strong> (<span class="s1">03:</span><span class="s1">5</span><span class="s1">9</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">She found a need&#8230;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">04:01</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Yes.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Hoda Kotb:</strong> (<span class="s1">04:</span><span class="s1">0</span><span class="s1">2</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">&#8230;She filled it, that was genius.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:</strong> (<span class="s1">04:03</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">She did it, she was really perfectly suited to do it and it&#8217;s taken time. At first, she kept her job. She, at night would work on her business. Then it got to the point where she could do it full-time. Sweeten is now available in New York and Philadelphia, but has plans to expand to eight more cities by 2020.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Hoda Kotb:</strong> (<span class="s1">04:19</span>)</p>
<p class="p2">Good for her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating a home can be a stressful process when you do it on your own—but it can be doubly so with someone you love. When there’s cohabitating involved, balancing different styles, opinions, and taste levels can get dicey. From choosing materials and appliances to deciding what makes the punch list, determining how to merge your style with a significant other is key to making a happy home. Here, couples give us a peek into renovating together, from blending opposite styles and accommodating one partner’s “bull-in-a-china-shop” cooking habits to one project ending in an engagement!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hissan-sophias-kitchen-foyer-renovation-downtown-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hissan and Sophia</a> knew that they wanted to purchase a larger home but couldn’t see eye-to-eye on style when it came time to renovate. Instead of choosing one’s vision over the other, the couple agreed to compromise. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom molding and classic, patterned wallpaper satisfied Sophia’s taste for the traditional. And by incorporating Hissan’s preference for the industrial—reclaimed dark wooden beams and oversized matte-finish pendants—this kitchen was able to find its style sweet spot.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21721" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x896.jpg" alt="White kitchen" width="600" height="896" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x896.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lia and Chris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developed a strong point of view going into their renovation that made selecting materials, appliances, and fixtures a smooth process. However, although they share similar styles, the couple debated over a waterfall edge for the kitchen countertop and labored over the decision of whether the kitchen should remain galley-style. Their commitment to working together, especially when making tough decisions, allowed them to create a kitchen they love.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21720 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-723x482.jpg" alt="White and blue kitchen" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikki and Chris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, living through a kitchen and bathroom renovation brought the couple even closer. In combining their styles, Chris took the initiative to find vintage-inspired hardware to match their wish of a modernized, NYC prewar bathroom. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their renovation had teaching moments including trusting others to work in their home and to take care of it, discovering their own preferences, managing a budget and timeline, and learning how to compromise. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also grew closer to their community during construction as they showered at friends’ homes and brushed their teeth at local coffee shops. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/becky-kitchen-renovation-clinton-hill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becky and Sarah</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spent most of the summer hiding out in their bedroom while their kitchen renovation was underway. Although living through the renovation was stressful at times, the couple didn’t just survive the process—they thrived. Their beautiful new kitchen led to an engagement. Sarah said that the renovation could have torn them apart, but in the end, it only made their bond stronger.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-cara-and-jareds-chelsea-kitchen-and-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cara and Jared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an avid cook and a professional chef, wanted a kitchen that could handle the two of them working side by side. Together, they chose materials that would suit their needs, deciding on built-to-order cabinets to expand storage and a durable and stain-resistant counter to account for Jared’s “bull-in-china-shop” tendencies. The result? A kitchen that can truly stand their combined heat.</span></p>
