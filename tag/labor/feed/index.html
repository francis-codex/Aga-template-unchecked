<h3>Why the right general contractor is important</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating can be a complicated process. However, the more you know about working with a general contractor, the better prepared you’ll be. While these professionals execute the labor of your renovation, they are also a collaborator to your dream home. Their team will be working in your space for several months. Because of this, you really want to be confident in knowing how to hire a contractor<span>—the right one for <em>your</em> project</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten outlines the process—from what to look for, to the key responsibilities you can expect from your general contractor.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Do you need a general contractor or a handyman?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first step to starting your project is figuring out the scope of your renovation. Depending on the level of labor your project requires, you will either need a general contractor or a handyman (or DIY!). To decipher the difference, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are you hanging things on walls, or taking down walls?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are you re-grouting tiles, or replacing them?</li>
<li>Smaller projects to make repairs or patch-over errors are handyman-ready. On the other hand, large-scale projects that involve electric or plumbing will require a permit or inspection. In this case, a contractor with a state Home Improvement Contractor (HIC) license will be obligatory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining labor for your renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For first-time renovators, figuring out what kind of labor is required for the project can be hard to determine. If you live in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-op</a> or condo, your alteration agreement may provide guidelines when hiring a general contractor. In other situations, checking your city’s Department of Buildings will offer information on the types of projects that require a permit. <strong>The most important thing to remember is that cutting corners with unlicensed workers is never worth the risk. </strong>It often leads to homeowners needing to pay extra to fix unfinished, subpar, or non-permitted work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doing the research to determine if you need the services of a general contractor is a crucial step in getting your project off the ground. Then the next step is finding the best contractor for your job.</p>
<h3 class="p1">How to hire a contractor suited to your project</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the process of interviewing and hiring a general contractor, start by looking for someone with experience in your neighborhood and who has done similar work. This can help you narrow down the field from thousands of general contractors to just a handful of experienced professionals. Keep these questions in mind as you search:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Has the contractor done work in your neighborhood?</li>
<li>Has the contractor done similar work to what you’re looking to get done?</li>
<li>Can the contractor provide quality references and photos of past work?</li>
<li>Is the contractor licensed? (Working with an unlicensed contractor isn’t worth the risk!)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask to see some of their past projects in person or to speak to their past clients—at least two. General contractors in Sweeten&#8217;s network have completed transformational renovations with past clients who are still happy with the work years later. This indicates that the contractor&#8217;s work has held up over time. <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten matches homeowners</a> to a selection of contractors based on location, budget, scope, and style for the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you&#8217;ve found someone you think would be a good fit for your project, take it one step further and make sure they’re a good fit for you. You’ll be working with this contractor for the duration of your project, so you should feel compatible! Here&#8217;s what to look for:</p>
<h4>Are they communicative?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you can trust your contractor to be responsive throughout the entire renovation process. Both parties will need to be on the same page, especially in terms of timeline.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is it a good fit personality and style-wise?</h4>
<ul>
<li>First impressions do matter! The contractor should be able to understand and carry out your particular sense of style. Additionally, with the amount of time they’ll be spending in your home, look for someone who meshes with your personality.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Do they have recent and reliable references?</h4>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s important<span style="color: #333333;"> to review </span>recent references for similar projects that your contractor has completed. You should be aware of the level of satisfaction of past clients. At Sweeten, our contractors have profiles that highlight past projects and client reviews to help you decide.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What does a general contractor do?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your general contractor manages your project from start to finish, focusing on the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Obtain proper licensing, insurance, and additional documents required by city, state, and specific to building needs</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Review site conditions and all relevant documents and drawings in order to fully understand the project and generate a proposal and bid (the proposal is the plan and the bid is the proposed cost)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Specify the final scope of work, and schedule, and come up with a contract</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Define the payment and deliverables schedules</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Request and follow advice from the architects, engineers, or design team</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Manage and coordinate general aspects of a project, like site requirements</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Provide skilled labor, tools, equipment, and various services</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Coordinate subcontractors and other trades required by the scope of work and oversee the quality of their work</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Maintain schedule and communication with clients</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Review project completion with the client and final payment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asking general contractors for estimates (at least 3)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A contractor will partner with you to decide on:</p>
<ol>
<li>The final scope of work</li>
<li>Materials</li>
<li>Timeline</li>
<li>The best form of communication, and how often they should check in with you</li>
<li>Budget and payment schedule (make sure you have everything in writing)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sweeten recommends getting 3-5 estimates from contractors to see where the price range falls. This also allows you to experience the different personalities and communication styles of the contractors. Who do you have the best rapport with? Who do you feel the most comfortable with? These factors will play a big part in your decision when hiring a general contractor.</p>
<h3>Understanding estimates from general contractors</h3>
<p>Bid leveling is a crucial step that will allow you to break down and compare the services the contractor can offer at each price point. This occurs once you have received estimates, or bids, from contractors.</p>
<p>For example, one contractor who gives a higher-priced bid may provide more individual services, like answering questions on the weekend or putting a mood board together for you. A comparative breakdown of the bids will reveal a clearer picture of what services you want as a renovator.</p>
<h4>Sweeten offers free bid-leveling services to homeowners</h4>
<p>New to renovating and unsure how to read bids? Sweeten provides a free bid-leveling call to all homeowners who use the service. Read all about Sweeten&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/bid-leveling-call-for-renovation-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid leveling and estimate comparison call.</a> (You can also read up on this process with Sweeten&#8217;s guide to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid leveling</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you meet the contractors during site visits, be prepared with a list of questions to ask. Do not be afraid to speak up about what you want! That being said, be open to a contractor&#8217;s ideas and suggestions. The licensed contractor is a professional with a wealth of knowledge about construction and years of experience. This is their specialty, and they likely have answers to all of your questions.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to #2 in our series, Q&amp;A with Jean, in which I hope to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating. We hear your questions every day and work happily to bring you answers through our team and blog. Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings a new set of circumstances and new queries with it. Feel free to email me at JBrownhill@sweeten.com. In the meantime, I’ll even include questions that I get asked most often—even at cocktail parties!</p>
<p>Today our question is about the costs of home renovation in New York City; if this topic interests you, I&#8217;d suggest checking out our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bath</a> cost guides, including <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Budget Basics: Renovation Costs Per Square Foot</a>.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Why is renovating in New York City so expensive?</p>
<p><strong>JEAN:</strong> Like a lot of things in NYC, it comes down to logistics. For a general contractor to transport the drywall and studs—not mention the many other materials and tools necessary for the job—to your home, the planning can be really complicated. Not only does the team need to get everything to your apartment building, they need to get it up to your floor. Sometimes that means coordinating with an elevator, but in some cases, it can mean using a crane and craning in materials. What adds to the high cost of the materials part of a bid is the logistics.</p>
<p>The labor side of the equation is equally complicated. A lot of renovation projects going on simultaneously in the city and every contractor needs a tiler, a plumber, an electrician, etc. In order to survive the competition, he/she has to pay a premium to get a crew to show up at your job site. It all comes down to supply and demand. There are only so many skilled laborers in the city, and getting those laborers plus materials to your apartment can be challenging. Even for a house in Brooklyn, the crew still has to drive through traffic and bring the drywall from a warehouse that&#8217;s likely stationed in another borough, like Queens. Overall, it’s the cumulative expense of coordinating the drivers, trucks, and deliveries, plus having someone ready to accept deliveries and bring it to your home, that really drives up the cost.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an important line item in your budget, especially if your vision involves a layout change. That could involve moving load-bearing walls and gas lines. The NKBA estimates design fees eat up about four percent of a kitchen remodel cost. Sweeten designer <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, who has done work in Westchester, said it&#8217;s more realistic to put away 15 percent of your budget for design if you’re in the mood for a major layout change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re giving your kitchen more of a makeover than an overhaul, it’s possible to work closely with an experienced general contractor on the design and forgo a designer. Statistics from the NKBA show that the majority of homeowners relied on a general contractor and only 22 percent used a designer. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck</a>, a Sweeten contractor who works in Westchester, has found that many clients in the county take a hands-on approach to design and often don’t use a designer or architect. However, an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect&#8217;s services will be needed</a> if plumbing or gas lines are moving, there are structural changes, or if a landmark property is being renovated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PERMITS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building permits are handled by the building department of each individual town within Westchester County. &#8220;Individual&#8221; is the key word here because methods of calculations can change dramatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Rye, the most of the <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/money/real-estate/homes/2017/03/22/westchester-priciest-zipcodes/99506058/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive</a> area in Southern Westchester—the median price for a home is $1,380,000—it’s no surprise that building permits are calculated based on the cost of a renovation. For every $1,000 in your kitchen remodel budget, that’s an additional $17 for your building permits. That average $64,000 kitchen overhaul will cost at least $1,088 in permits. If plumbing and electrical permits are required, that’s an additional $200 a pop (for a less extensive renovation, these permits may not be necessary).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the township of Peekskill, building permit costs are at the end of a minor mathematical equation. Multiply the square footage of your project by $150. Then, multiply that figure by 0.10. For a 200-square-foot kitchen, that’s $3,000. So take a moment to look at how the building department of your township calculates permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/westchester-county-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-34831 size-full" title="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png" alt="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" width="320" height="60" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png 320w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>APPLIANCES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Village Appliances in Westchester, a budget appliance package (fridge, oven, dishwasher and microwave), can go for under $5,000. However, Joe Gagliardo, the owner of Village Appliances, doesn’t sell too many of those. The majority of customers either go for a package in the $5,000 to $8,000 range or in the mid-price range of $18,000 to $22,000, which will get you brands such as General Electric and Electrolux. The high-end price spectrum will deliver brands such as Viking and Miele for a four-piece suite (fridge, range, hood, and dishwasher) at a price ranging from $17,000 to $26,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At <a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bilotta Kitchens</a>, clients often buy in the $12,000 to $15,000 range for an appliance package, according to senior designer and CKD Randy O’Kane. This will get you brands such as Thermador, Sub-Zero, and Wolf. There’s always room to mix and match, but brands do offer a discount or throw in items like blenders, toasters and hoods for free if you go with the same brand for your appliances, Randy said. “It is the heart and soul of a kitchen,” she said. “Cabinets are great, but it is all about cooking.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation can cost between $500 and $1,000, and that price will depend on how much work your contractor has already done. If water lines have not been run or outlets are not in the necessary areas, that could push up installation costs, Joe said. For those after custom range hoods, then plan for the $2,000 and $8,000 range.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-peninsula-golden-chairs" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-32475 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen peninsula with golden chairs and blue kitchen cabinets with silver appliances after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label">(Above) Tracey and Brian&#8217;s Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-stamp-of-approval-for-a-westchester-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation</a> in Pelham Manor, New York</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CABINETS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinets and hardware (think handles and knobs) are a big-ticket item on every kitchen remodel cost budget. They typically take up 30 percent of costs, according to NKBA. In a basic kitchen renovation, that’s $6,000. For a major overhaul worth $60,000, cabinets cost almost $20,000. What typically makes a big <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difference in cabinet cost</a> is whether you want custom, pre-fabricated or a mix of both. Something pre-fabricated from IKEA or Home Depot will cost around $130 a linear foot. Custom jobs can shoot up to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear square foot</a>. However, with that higher price, there is more freedom in deciding your kitchen layout. You can also get <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a> with custom cabinets. Semi-custom cabinets generally are about 50 percent cheaper than full custom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or do what Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill did in her own kitchen renovation: the recycled customized option. &#8220;I scoured Renovation Angel&#8217;s website and purchased a used-but-high-end kitchen for about $10,000, which is what I could have spent on cabinets alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A complete kitchen included appliances and cabinetry.&#8221; Jean then customized the cabinets to fit her space, which often meant filler panels were wider on one side than the other, or building a soffit was necessary. &#8220;It was like working on a jigsaw puzzle in order to make the kitchen look like it fit in the space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I was okay with these kinds of imperfections in exchange for essentially getting a premium kitchen on an Ikea type of budget.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>COUNTERTOPS</strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.westchesterkitchenandbath.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester Kitchen and Bath</a>, quartz is overwhelmingly the most popular countertop, according to showroom manager and designer Donna Magnotta. “It’s heat-, stain-, scratch-, and bacteria-resistant,” she said, “and it&#8217;s maintenance-free.” Natural stones, like marble, need routine staining and sealing. Quartz starts around $85 per linear foot and is on the mid to high-end of the price scale, which includes the cost of fabricating and installing. Laminate starts at $20 a linear foot, but is rarely purchased, Donna said. Granite is next up the ladder at about $35 a linear foot. On the high end, natural stones start at about $120 a linear foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LIGHTING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kitchen lighting isn’t a big budget line item. It takes up on four percent of total costs on average. The end price, of course, will always be determined by your tastes. In a $20,000 kitchen, that’s only $800. For a major remodel in the $60,000 range, lighting costs look closer to $2,400.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PLUMBING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On an average remodel, plumbing costs are about the same at $800. If there is a layout change to your Westchester kitchen, then that will likely add to your plumbing costs, which also includes gas lines. And the more you alter the basic layout of your space, the more your kitchen remodel cost will increase for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting, and inspections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FLOORING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a budget, Westchester’s <a href="https://suburbanfloors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suburban Floors</a> has a vinyl Karndean-Knight Tile that is $3.50 a square foot that is “still very durable and stylish,” said Emily Carpentieri, the store’s owner. The price per square foot does not include installation. On the higher end is cork or wide-plank wood flooring. These go for $8.25 to $15 a square foot. But vinyl floors in the $5 to $7 range is Suburban Floors’ biggest seller. “These would blow your mind how real they looked,” said Emily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LABOR AND INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction labor can change depending upon your Westchester zip code. The costs are less expensive the further you are from NYC. For Peekskill, labor costs are 22 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr.com</a>. Dobbs Ferry comes in at 40 percent higher and Croton-on-Hudson at 27 percent higher than the national average. The kitchen renovation cost in Rye could have a labor budget 55 percent above the national average. To compare, the labor cost for a kitchen renovation on the Upper East Side is 77 percent higher than the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t forget installation for appliances, cabinetry, plumbing, and electrical. These typically take about 17 percent of a budget, which is about $3,500 for an average kitchen. And as mentioned above, factor in $500 to $1,000 for appliance installation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, renovations are like fingerprints<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no two are alike. That includes their budgets. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator in Westchester allocated their $56,620 renovation budget:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/westchesterkitchen-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25369 mb-24 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation cost" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/westchesterkitchen-1-723x506.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation cost" width="723" height="506" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22777 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg" alt="Modern kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel and Eric&#8217;s kitchen</a> in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine cooking in your new kitchen for the first time&#8230;the style! The smart layout! The shiny new appliances and lovely lighting! The team at Sweeten is inspired daily by our clients’ posts describing their renovation dreams, and the best place to start the process is with a realistic budget. Sweeten&#8217;s guide will help you learn what to expect for kitchen renovation costs.</p>
<h3>Average kitchen renovation costs in the U.S.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The national average for a basic kitchen renovation is <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$22,000</a> and swings up to about $60,000 for a major overhaul. What if your desires exceed your bank account? Tweaking the budget so your project comes within your price range while maintaining quality begins with understanding the cost breakdown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen design costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association&#8217;s (NKBA) estimates design fees will comprise about four percent of your budget. Although this percentage could grow. For example, a kitchen designer in NYC might cost 15 percent of that budget, says <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, a Sweeten designer. The NKBA also found that only 22 percent of homeowners renovating a kitchen or a bathroom actually hired a designer. Instead, many chose to work closely with an experienced general contractor on their design to bring down the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just remember that your design will play a big role in the end budget. If you’re dreaming of a layout change that involves moving load-bearing walls and gas lines, take into account the additional paperwork, inspections, and fees later on.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Appliances</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The more you value your cooking skills, the sooner you should make your budget decisions in this category. “If the client falls in love with a 48-inch range, the designer can fit that into the design,” explains Jace Kieffer from <a href="https://www.kieffers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kieffer’s Appliances</a> in Lansdale, PA. Your appliance and ventilation choices may impact the design, he adds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a starter home, a basic four-appliance kitchen set—range, fridge, microwave and dishwasher—costs around $2,000. However, if you’re renovating a kitchen, it’s likely you will want to upgrade to at least premium economy appliances. They cost between $4,000 and $5,000 and have a life expectancy of about seven years. Luxury brands will set you back at least $12,000, a cost that should be weighed against their 15-year life expectancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Across the country, you’re unlikely to see much variation in the cost of luxury appliances. That’s because manufacturers often put minimum price restrictions on their appliances (sorry, no Black Friday deals here). If you’re happy with a lower grade, it might be worth shopping around for a sweeter price.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Ventilation</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like appliances, it is helpful to factor ventilation into the plans early. A basic over-the-range hood that leaves room for the microwave goes for around $300. A standalone hood from a premium economy brand costs $500 or more. A luxury brand might set you back about $2,000. Customs hoods from a metal fabricator can cost upwards of $10,000, Jace said. You also need to plan for ducting, which a general contractor usually takes care of.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Cabinets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest investment of your kitchen renovation will likely be cabinetry and hardware (such as handles and knobs)&#8211;this category typically makes up about 30 percent of budgets. A big factor in pricing will be your preference for custom or pre-fabricated cabinets from stores like Home Depot and IKEA. Stock cabinets average out at about $130 for a linear foot. For a custom job, the price might be as much as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear foot</a>. Custom cabinets will give you greater freedom when deciding your kitchen layout and finished look. It could also get you <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a>. Don’t forget that these cabinets must be installed and that will likely be an additional cost. See more on labor and installation below.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an area where you can scrimp or splurge, depending on your priorities. Countertops can start at $5 per square foot for a butcher’s block or laminate, a synthetic material. A low-end quartz could cost about $50 a square foot and a marble around $60 a square foot. Something more pricey such as granite could cost as much as $100 a square foot. Don’t forget to factor in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backsplash</a>, which is the wall area between the countertop and cabinets. That could range from $3 a square foot to $35.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Floors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Flooring will represent 7 percent of an average budget, or about $1,400, according to the NKBA. Concrete or vinyl flooring are economical choices and can look cool along with being easy to clean. Stone or wood flooring are higher-end options. Keep in mind that new base cabinets that are a different depth than your original may expose old and mismatched flooring.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lighting in the kitchen</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is generally a lower-spend category. In a $20,000 budget, lighting materials usually come in at about $800. Again, this will move up or down depending on your tastes. Besides ventilation, those remodeling their kitchens spent the least on lighting, according to the NKBA.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen plumbing costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like everything else in renovating, your vision and choices will have a big impact on kitchen plumbing costs. On an average remodel, plumbing materials will match lighting expenses at about $800. If you’re considering that layout change then plumbing and gas lines may have to move. That will lead to the added costs in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting and inspections.</p>
<h3><b>Kitchen remodel labor and installation costs</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Preparing the renovation site—leveling tilted floors, replacing the sheetrock, etc.—can cost a few thousand dollars. Add to that installation of appliances and cabinetry, plumbing and electrical, which could take about 17 percent of your total budget or almost $3,500 on an average kitchen renovation. It’s worth pointing out that labor costs can change based on geography. New York City is the most expensive. Chicago’s labor costs are on average about 18 percent cheaper, according to RSMeans data. Philadelphia is a few percentage points lower at about 21 percent and LA sits at more than 30 percent lower than New York. And check with your contractor if their fees cover permits. If not, that could add another $1,000 or two.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Resale Value</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Setting a budget can be overwhelming with the cost of all these separate items. The good news is renovations are an investment. For example, a $62,000 investment in a kitchen <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could see</a> a $40,000 increase in resale value on the home, according to Remodeling Magazine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, that also increases the value of your property for taxation purposes. In Philadelphia, home improvements can get a <a href="https://www.biaofphiladelphia.com/tax-abatement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax abatement</a>. The value your new kitchen adds to your home will not be taxed for 10 years, said Marianne Scott from the Building Industry Association of Philadelphia.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, no two renovations and their budgets are the same. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator allocated their $25,000 kitchen renovation budget:</p>

<h2 class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23909 mb-0 size-chrono" title="beige-kitchen-yellow-wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-723x510.jpg" alt="beige kitchen with yellow highlight wall and white kitchen cabinets after renovation" width="723" height="510" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-723x510.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-300x212.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01-600x424.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_BradCApt-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are pretty good that you’ve painted your walls before. Interior painting is a project that many are willing to tackle solo, and the prospect of a DIY job can be tempting given that the outlay is just the cost of paint and some inexpensive tools. But going pro is often the right choice, with real costs and real benefits, especially when painting is part of a more ambitious home renovation. Let’s take a look at why there are such wide variations in cost, and how to decide who is right for the job.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br /></a><b>Costs for painting by the gallon &amp; necessary equipment</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many options for paint, but tried and true staples such as <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Moore</a>, <a href="https://www.behr.com/consumer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behr</a>, <a href="https://www.askval.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valspar</a>, and <a href="https://www.sherwin-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sherwin Williams</a> are all available at your local hardware store or a big box store like Home Depot or Lowe’s. By the gallon, these brands rarely exceed $50 and usually average around $30, depending on the specifics. You can also go upscale with a luxury paint like Farrow &amp; Ball, where a gallon will run you $100, or <a href="https://www.finepaintsofeurope.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fine Paints of Europe</a>, at approximately $110 a gallon. Additionally, you’ll probably need to pay for primer, which averages around the same cost as paint. The rest of the supplies—rollers, extenders, brushes, trays/pans, and paper or tarp—will represent a small percentage of your total budget. For example, a brush costs a few dollars at any local hardware store, and a 36” x 900’ roll of brown paper costs $39 at Home Depot (enough for a very large paint job.)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Variables that&#8217;ll impact costs to paint a home&#8217;s interior </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here’s where it gets more complicated: like most other types of renovation work, painting is very site-specific. This means that all the charming idiosyncrasies of your prewar apartment (e.g., the crown moldings, prized paneling, that curved hallway wall) translate into higher painting costs. Many experts will refuse to provide a bid without a site visit, and with good reason. They need to make a visual assessment of the condition of the walls and surroundings before providing a competitive estimate. They will want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What condition are the walls in and how much prep will be required?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How high are the ceilings, what are the specific dimensions of the surfaces, and how much trim detail is there?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the quality of work in the rest of the apartment? (This helps them assess where to land on the spectrum of “rental grade” to “luxury” in terms of the finished product.)</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there furniture to work around? How much of it?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there lead present in the existing paint?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the building restrictions on construction work?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where is the site?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23910 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-highlight-wall-breakfast-nook" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-723x1083.jpg" alt="blue highlight wall in a breakfast nook with dining table and hanging pendant lights after renovation " width="723" height="1083" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-723x1083.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Painters use all of this information to assess how many labor hours the job will require. For example, they take into account how much commuting time will be required, and how long a day they will be allowed to work. They think about whether they’ll have to circle the block and monitor a meter, or if they can just park in your driveway. And, they note how much prep will be necessary, in addition to the actual painting time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One other variable to keep in mind is that small projects tend to offer less bang for your buck because there is some time that elapses between steps. For example, if your project is limited to one bedroom, there isn’t anything else the workers can do while they are waiting for the primer to dry, whereas if your project includes more rooms, they can alternate working in different spaces. For a small project, you end up paying for the whole day anyway, because waiting becomes part of the job.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Labor costs for painting </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, painters are often willing to provide their per-hour rate to clients, unlike general contractors or millworkers, whose projects are not as easily broken down into an hourly rate. This means that once you know the per-hour rate that your painter charges, and how many hours the job will take, there is very little mystery to how your project will be billed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While hourly labor rates do vary, they typically start at about $25 to $30 per hour on the low end and average around $50 to $60 per hour for an experienced painter (not a huge range.)</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Preparation before interior painting walls</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The real disparity in painting costs arise because of the amount of time spent on prep. Prep work is what makes the difference between a rental-grade finished product and a high-end, luxury one. Perfectly smooth walls and incisive clean lines are difficult (and thus expensive) to come by, so it is often just a question of how much imperfection a homeowner is willing to live with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If one painter provides a $5,000 bid for a project while another painter bids $3,000, most of the difference will be in the amount of prep. The higher bid will probably involve carefully “raking” the walls (a process that involves darkening the room and using a small spotlight to highlight problem spots), systematically repairing all the spots, applying and sanding down compound, and then a thorough cleaning of all the surfaces to ensure maximum paint adhesion. The lower bid will likely skip over some of these steps to reduce labor hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unsurprisingly, detail work takes a lot of prep. Taping and prep steps double as soon as you introduce a line of molding in a contrasting color, and trim details are critical focal points so your design choices and architectural details will come into play in determining project timeline and cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many renovators have also wondered about skim-coating, a particularly time-intensive (and thus costly) aspect of prep work. Skim-coating is a process in which you smooth out the wall by rolling thinned-out, all-purpose joint compound (“mud”) on the walls, and then immediately smooth it out with a knife edge. Because the mud dries quickly, it can only be applied in small patches. And each layer is thin, so it may require multiple layers to even out very bumpy or textured walls. Although it sounds relatively simple, it requires skill and experience to do well. As a result, skim-coating is billed separately, and at a higher rate (roughly $10 to $20 more expensive than painting by the hour), and will also take more time than the painting itself. That combination of a higher hourly rate and more time needed for skim-coating can easily double the cost of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Skim-coating is a big undertaking. If you’re on the fence about whether your walls need it, you might compromise by focusing on areas that are well lit (where defects are easy to see) or in rooms that you plan to paint with a gloss or semi-gloss paint (these finishes tend to magnify imperfections). You might decide that a very visible wall that gets lots of natural light needs the full treatment, while walls that aren’t quite as prominent or immediately visible upon entry get a bit less focus. Pause in each room and think about where your eye hits when you walk in and out and when you are naturally using the room. You may find that only one out of four walls really needs the re-surfacing that skim-coating provides.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And lastly, if there is lead paint detected in your home, there are additional steps that workers must take to contain dust. Painters will need to ensure special staging of the work site with plastic tarp, and use special vacuums that do not recirculate dust into the air. Again, more time spent prepping equals more money.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review surfaces and walls before beginning to paint </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a homeowner, you can start by assessing the condition and complexity of the space, and think through how much prep and perfection you want to include in your budget. An empty room with walls in decent condition might just need one to two painters over one to two days of work to get a fresh coat up, whereas an entire home with varied surfaces and heavy furniture will require a full team working over the course of two weeks or more to prep, paint, and finish across a variety of spaces.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Here’s a primer on kitchen cabinets, from custom designs to stock options</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinet construction may well end up being the&nbsp;single biggest expense of your entire renovation, and the results are the most obvious visual proof of your investment, so this can feel like a heavy decision. The challenge (and opportunity) is that your choices are endless, but if you focus on a few key factors, you can find the right cabinets for your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20751 mb-24 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="487" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br>
IKEA cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Matthew&#8217;s kitchen renovation</a>.</p>
<p>While it’s tempting to assume that your budget is the only consideration and while it’s true that custom cabinets can be (much, much) more expensive than stock cabinets, they don’t have to be.&nbsp;Even the cheapest kitchen is an enormous investment, so if budget isn’t necessarily the deciding factor, how should you decide and how can you keep your budget from dictating your choices? First, a few definitions.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color=""></a></p>
<h2>Should you go with custom or pre-fabricated cabinets?</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stock cabinets</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA</a>&nbsp;is widely considered the go-to for stock cabinets. Unlike almost anyone else, they mass-produce a system of set sizes, colors, finishes, and features that you pick and choose. The pieces of your order are pulled from stock supplies and shipped to your home, where you need to handle both the assembly and installation. IKEA keeps its costs low because they are sending your order to you in pieces and because the materials they use are very inexpensive.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pre-fabricated cabinets</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lowes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lowe’s</a>,&nbsp;and other big-box national retailers are distributors of independent lines of cabinets. They offer a semi-custom option: like IKEA, you pick and choose from set sizes, colors, finishes, and features (though national retailers tend to have more options overall). Unlike IKEA, your order is then manufactured and assembled for you so that your cabinets arrive ready for installation. Because you have more choice in materials and construction, the range of prices varies more here. You will probably pay more upfront for higher-quality materials, but you may spend less on labor because the cabinets are assembled before they get to you for installation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Custom cabinets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets are designed and constructed by hand based on your individual design. You define the sizes, materials, finishes, and features and your order is hand-crafted and delivered for installation.&nbsp;Because your choices for materials and construction are endless, the range of material and labor costs is very wide. The costs here are generally distributed between your choice of material and style, labor, and a more personalized design and customer service approach.</p>
<h3><strong>High-end, built-to-order cabinet systems</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A small group of cabinet companies also offer cabinetry systems that are extremely high-end (<a href="https://bulthaup.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulthaup</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.henrybuilt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henrybuilt</a>&nbsp;are examples). These companies are known for beautiful and durable cabinet construction and best-in-industry warranties, but the bare minimum for even&nbsp;a small kitchen can easily exceed <strong>$20,000</strong>, so unlike other categories of cabinet construction, this option is only available if the starting point for your budget allows you to consider it.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets might be less expensive than you think if your kitchen has limited space, lots of space, or an unusual layout.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a tight kitchen, stock and pre-fabricated cabinets in standard sizes might not be worth the initial material savings because you will need more inventive labor to fit everything in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a large kitchen, extra depth or high ceilings give you an opportunity for additional storage and functionality. Non-standard cabinet heights and depths can bring value to your renovation and re-sale value. Multiple corners, awkward niches, and unusual footprints can be&nbsp;tough to outfit. Stock and pre-fab cabinets in standard sizes may force you to spend money on filler materials, wasted space, and labor for semi-custom adjustments.</p>

<h3>Custom cabinets might be worth extra money if you plan to stay for years, have kids or a high-traffic kitchen, or want personalized support.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Semi-custom and custom cabinets offer higher&nbsp;quality materials in sturdier thicknesses that last longer.&nbsp;Particle board and MDF, two common materials for stock cabinets, are susceptible to water and have a shorter life span than plywood and wood. 1/2” particle board will not last as long as 3/4” or 1” furniture-grade plywood cabinet bases, and solid wood doors and drawers will endure tougher handling over the years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets also typically use sturdier construction and joinery methods. Custom cabinetmakers will often use dovetail joints that interlock pieces of wood to distribute weight and stress more evenly, whereas stock nut, bolt, and nail methods isolate wear on a few points. They also offer options for tougher hardware elements like hinges and drawer sliders. In addition, custom cabinet makers generally provide a higher level of design support and customer assistance. They will do site visits, re-designs, and get a real person on the phone with you when you need it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You might be absolutely fine to handle the ordering and delivery of a stock system, but if you hit a roadblock, custom cabinet companies expect to support you and respond personally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Once you order the IKEA materials and you pay for assembly and installation, you’re not far off from a custom option that would last longer and provide more options – for a few extra thousand dollars, you may actually get a much better deal.&nbsp;Each time you take one of these steps up in material quality and thickness, you have a corresponding price and life span increase.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Alan<br>

<h3>Cost aside, pre-fabricated cabinets might work best for you if your renovation timeline is speedy or you feel overwhelmed by choice.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets have lengthier lead times. If you’re gearing up for a renovation in the next two months, you can get your hands on pre-fab cabinets in-store on a same-day basis, or delivered within two or three weeks. And, a perceived weakness of pre-fabricated cabinets is actually a real strength: for many homeowners, unlimited choice is not necessarily desirable. Many homeowners go with custom cabinets because they think they want options and then end up feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed. Pre-fabricated cabinets offer a pick-and-choose experience that requires less homework and decision fatigue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Many clients ask us what styles we offer and it can be hard to explain that it can be anything they imagine. Shops like ours provide personalized&nbsp;design as part of the overall service to build features for individual clients.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a></i></p>
<h3>Still having trouble deciding? Go for a&nbsp;hybrid!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Combining a pre-fab kitchen with custom pieces can lower your cost without compromising on quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Combining a pre-fab kitchen with custom pieces allows for lower cost and uniqueness. Companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.semihandmade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semihandmade</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://kokeena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kokeena</a>&nbsp;make door and drawer faces for stock cabinets so you’re not limited to IKEA’s palette. In addition, there are endless options for shelving, countertops, and cabinet pulls&nbsp;allowing for individuality while using inexpensive pre-fab cabinets.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Lauren and Adam</a></i></p>

For more modern kitchens, a matte-finish knob or pull is an easy way to customize cabinets. Repainting with a calming neutral or a bold jewel tone can refresh a kitchen without requiring demolition.</p> </div> </div>
