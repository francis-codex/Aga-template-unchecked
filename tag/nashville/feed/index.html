<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45280" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nashville-Garage-Blog.jpg" alt="garage remodel nashville" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nashville-Garage-Blog.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nashville-Garage-Blog-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you are like many homeowners, you may be looking in all directions to increase living space. Looking upward means building a second story. Looking toward the back translates to a house addition. But one direction that is often overlooked is to the side or front: the garage. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines how a garage remodel in Nashville could be your solution amid several home addition options. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Types of garage remodels</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Living rooms or family rooms</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Garages are often remodeled to provide supplemental living or family room space. The garage is insulated, wired, painted, and flooring is installed. Sometimes, a small powder room, with only a toilet and sink, is added. The powder room eliminates trips to the main part of the house.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Living quarters for renters</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some homeowners choose to install a self-contained apartment for renters. This arrangement can give the homeowner a source of passive income. Over the long term, it may defray the cost of the garage remodel. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Living quarters typically include a bedroom, full bathroom, and a kitchen. A lockable pass-through to the main part of the home is usually included. With this, homeowners can lock the door on their side to prevent the renters from entering. Most remodels of this nature include a separate exterior door so that renters can enter their apartment without going through the main house.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Living quarters for self or family</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Garages are often remodeled to provide living quarters for elderly parents, friends, or children. In many cases, this apartment has the same facilities as does an apartment for renters. </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Dedicated entertainment or work area</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your garage remodel may create a single room or multiple rooms for a specific purpose. The remodeled garage may become an entertainment room, home movie theater, gym, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/derelict-garage-finds-purpose-she-shed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office, workshop, or studio</a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Garage remodel costs in Nashville</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Garage remodel permits alone can cost $1,000 to $1,500. For a simple living-room space that does not include plumbing, the cost will begin in the $10,000 to $20,000 range. Most of this cost is devoted to outfitting the space with a floor and filling in the garage door.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">More often, though, garage remodels intended as living quarters begin at $20,000 and rise sharply.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Garage remodel process and timeline</span></h3>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Before you speak to a contractor, decide on the primary function for the remodel. A basic family or living room can be a relatively simple project since plumbing may not be involved. A full-scale rental apartment will be more expensive and will take several weeks or months.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">After you’ve <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">received multiple estimates</a> and chosen your contractor, discuss if any Nashville overlay and zoning issues need to be considered.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">You will meet with the contractor and an architect. The architect will draw up plans. The contractor applies for permits.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">After a roll-off dumpster is delivered to the property, workers demolish parts of the interior of the garage. The garage door is removed.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Carpenters fill in the empty space where the garage door was located. Usually, this will be an exterior wall system, complete with insulation and perhaps even windows.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Depending on the plan, workers may need to frame the floor with joists. This will raise the floor to the height of the main house’s floor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">With the walls open, electricians and plumbers run wire and pipes through the walls.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Carpenters frame the interior walls and the ceiling.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Workers add a heating and cooling system.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Drywall installers hang and finish the drywall.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Floor installers add the floor covering of your choice on top of the subfloor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">A painting team will paint the inside of the garage remodel. They will also paint areas outside of the garage, in front.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Plumbers finish installing bathroom fixtures. Electricians complete the rest of the wiring.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">How a garage remodel affects house value</span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">One important consideration before starting a garage remodel is whether it will increase the value of your home.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you are considering a garage remodel in Nashville, you might be thinking of immediate, personal needs. Your family may be increasing in size. Or you may have elderly parents who need housing. In either case, remodeling your garage may represent a lower net financial cost than building a separate structure or buying a new house.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">On the other hand, if you do intend to eventually sell your home, consider how the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">garage remodel will affect your home’s value</a>. Potential home buyers may view the lack of vehicle storage as a deficit. Other buyers may welcome the extra space.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Permits and restrictions</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The City of Nashville requires a building permit for any new building or a modification of an existing structure. You must also have permits for individual tradework, such as for electrical, plumbing, or HVAC work. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nashville is a city of many historic structures. The Nashville Metropolitan Historic Zoning Commission (MHZC) was formed to protect Nashville’s architectural styles and character. If your home is located in a historic preservation and historic landmark overlay, you must apply for a Preservation Permit.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">MHZC permit applications require a full set of plans, elevations, photos, and more. After you submit the permit application, the MHZC will meet to consider your project. After a permit is approved, you must stick to the conditions of the permit. For example, the MHZC will impose penalties or injunctions if the garage siding does not match that of the rest of the house.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Nashville and Davidson County, neighborhood leaders and government officials take a close look at Airbnb-type rentals. These types of rentals are called Short Term Rental Properties (STRPs). The Metro Codes Department must approve of your rental property before you list it as an STRP (but not before you build it).</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Heat and cool your garage remodel in Nashville</span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">With Nashville’s extremes of heat and cold, you should add a heating or cooling system to your garage remodel. Generally, there are three options:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li6"><span class="s3">Continue with the main house’s HVAC system. Workers continue the ductwork from the main house into the garage. The main house’s HVAC system must be adequate to handle the increased loads. This option works well when remodeling a garage for a living or family room: one that will flow seamlessly from the main house.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s3">Install a separate HVAC system. This is the best option when remodeling a garage as living quarters. It is also the costliest option.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s3">The lowest cost installation option is heating in the form of baseboard or wall heaters. For cooling, install one or more window or wall unit air conditioners. Installation is less expensive but the cost of service is higher. This is because baseboard heaters, wall heaters, and window unit A/Cs are less efficient than HVAC systems.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Where to park your vehicles</span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When reviewing permit applications for garage remodels in Nashville, the city will want to know where the displaced vehicles will go. Like most large cities, Nashville wants to reduce the number of cars that are street-parked.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you have a paved driveway, the solution can be as simple as moving the cars to the driveway instead of in the garage. This is the lowest cost solution, though your vehicles will be left out in the open.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you have ample room in the front of your property, you may wish to build a carport or even a new garage. This will completely or partially protect the vehicles. It also may appeal to future buyers. Zoning issues may come into play since a 20-foot setback in front must be maintained. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">A garage remodel is a lower-cost alternative to building an addition but it is not low-cost. Think of a garage remodel as an investment in your home’s value and in your happiness.</span></p>
