<h3>Wrestling with the idea of renovating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We moved to Clinton Hill over a decade ago, and always loved the neighborhood with its history of housing for returning servicemen who worked in the Navy Yard. On a total whim, we went to an open house in the Clinton Hill Co-ops and made an offer on the first apartment we saw: an 800-square-foot, one-bedroom that had been converted into a junior two-bedroom.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was frighteningly familiar with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span class="s2">Clinton Hill Co-op section</span></a> of the Sweeten website. Our neighbor also used <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to renovate her kitchen, and it looked fantastic. It seemed like a simple concept, but Jim and I were just completely overwhelmed with the idea of a renovation. Because our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment</a> really felt like it was falling down around us, we knew that we would need to change almost everything.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to look for a place upstate, hoping that more room and a home for weekend getaways would help alleviate the stress of our overcrowded and dark apartment. We made an offer on a house, had it approved, started to negotiate, and realized we needed to feel good in our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary residence</a> before we took on a second space.</p>

<h3>Finding our general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We headed straight to </span>Sweeten<span style="text-align: justify;">, were <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with threeÂ general contractors</a> right away, and within a week </span>picked our contractor<span style="text-align: justify;">. He was incredibly responsive and patient with us as we walked through our apartment over and over again, thinking about the best way to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open our kitchen</a>, update the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>, reconfigure our bedroom, shore up our pockmarked walls and ceiling, refinish our floors, and add storage everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We were absolutely giddy with the concept of overhead lighting! We were wired for several fixtures in the living room and kitchen, as well as recessed lights in the hallways and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. Because our apartment had been dark and crowded for so long, we gravitated toward a simple, minimalist design with white and gray paint to brighten the space and give it a clean look.</span></p>
<h3>Personalizing the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim grew up with visions of a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> island where everyone could gather</a> to eat and socializeâthat became our only non-negotiable. It helped us focus our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning on the kitchen first</a>. We knew we wanted custom cabinets, so our contractor brought in his cabinet maker to meet with us and walk through the layout.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Within a week, they had sent us a 3D rendering of our new kitchen, with Jimâs dream island, plus an extended butcher block counter ideal for our boys to sit and finish homework while we cook. Our contractor suggested the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sophisticated-chalkboard-paint-ideas-4582330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chalkboard paintânow a huge hit with the kids</a>. He created a lot of extra storage under the island, including drawers for our pots and pans, plus a pantry along the extended counter. We have a dishwasher for the first time ever and love the kitchen tile.</p>

<h3>Storage reimagined</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor had the genius idea to extend our bedroom two feet into the living room, which allowed him to build a closet (we used to store our clothes in the boysâ room). It was worth the minimal loss of space to gain more storage. We also hired a closet company to build a shoe closet for us. Since our room has two windows, we decided on an <span>opaque</span> glass door to maintain some privacy, but also take advantage of the natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, kids' bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36112 " srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Our contractor came through on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the boys&#8217;<span style="color: #333333;"> bedroom</span>, our only <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directive was storage</a>, storage, storage. We wanted to find a way to keep all of their things in the bedroom, instead of spilling out into our common living areas. Once again, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our contractor came through</a> on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room, ensuring we lost very little floor space. Weâre not falling all over stuff anymore!</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36200 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-13-1.gif" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, custom closets, kids' bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></h3>
<p>In the <span style="color: #333333;">bathroom</span>, we needed to keep a bathtub because we have young boys, and I insisted on a large piece of custom glass as our partial shower door. He warned me it might be difficult to reach around for the water control, but I insisted. It looks lovely, but he was rightâitâs a bit of a struggle to help with bathtime.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, bathroom, shower, toilet, home, design" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36116 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Moving out during the renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our biggest challenge was realizing that, because we were <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating the entire space</a>, we would have to move out for an extended period of time. We didnât initially budget to live somewhere else, so the added cost was a bit of a shock. After three months, we were scheduled to move back in and had left the rental, when our contractor told us he was about a week behind. Much of this delay was due to some delayed deliveries of things I had ordered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had no place to go and had to live in the apartment while there were still tools and supplies everywhere, with no appliances or kitchen counters. It was a bit uncomfortable, but not unmanageable. In hindsight, we probably should have just booked the rental for an extra week as insurance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with Sweeten made us wonder what we had waited for. We were matched so quickly with a contractor, we were able to use the website to see examples of his work, we could reach out with questions and concerns. Another upside was the Sweeten blog, a huge source of inspiration! Our new apartment is <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exactly what we had hoped for</a>: simple, comfortable, bright, and uncluttered. It feels like home.</p>

<p>When it comes to the many types of renovations, <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> has seen it all! Whether a single-room remodel or adding square footage to a house, Sweeten helps homeowners envision their dream spacesâand then turns them into reality.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractors are skilled in many areas of construction. <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-does-sweeten-vet-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We check their licenses</a>, insurance, quality of work, and customer service skillsâall so we can ensure your remodel goes smoothly and you get connected with the right team for your project.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and supportâ for free. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some types of projects Sweeten contractors have completed.Â </span></span></p>

<h3>Entire Homes</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40095 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="house exterior" width="1000" height="847" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01-300x254.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01-600x508.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether an apartment, brownstone, or standalone house, Sweeten contractors can take any space and make it uniquely your own. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/tudor-style-house-renovation-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra and Nelson</a> wanted to update their Brooklyn home to fit their new needs. Their kids were grown, so they wanted to focus on the house. They wanted a more convenient living space. With the help of their contractor, they remodeled the kitchen, dining, and living room. Plus, they turned a small office into a beautiful sunroom.Â  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten also transforms apartments for open-concept living or more personal space with walls or partitions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/home-remodeling-tips-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitzie and Jenifer</a> (<em>below</em>). created a seamless flow from one living space to another.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41442" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-15.jpg" alt="living room and kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-15-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p>Kitchens &amp; Baths</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37769" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12.jpg" alt="New Jersey, Jersey City, renovation, two family, remodel, one family, kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchens and baths are the sweet spots for our contractors. No matter the square footage, each space comes with its own unique set of requirements. Bathrooms and kitchens can be rip-and-replace projects, where the floor plan is not altered or they can be of a larger scope. These types of projects can entail reworking/upgrading electrical and plumbing like was necessary forÂ two smaller <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baths combined as one</a> (<em>below</em>) or Carol and Jon&#8217;s<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-one-family-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweeten kitchen renovation</a> (<em>above</em>).Â  For these changes, an experienced contractor will call in the right pros to help.</span></p>

<h3>Garage Conversions / ADUs</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26067" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-01-1.jpg" alt="garage renovation after" width="990" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-01-1.jpg 990w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-01-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-01-1-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-01-1-723x487.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" /></p>
<p>Commonly known as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADUs</a> (accessory dwelling units), these converted spaces have become more and more popular. They are a great way to add valuable square footage to your home and create additional, functional spaces. Sweeten contractors converted <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/derelict-garage-finds-purpose-she-shed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle&#8217;s garage</a> (<em>above</em>) and turned <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaime&#8217;s garage</a> into a studio office (<em>below</em>). Each includes bathrooms and kitchenettes.</p>

<p>Exteriors and Additions</p>

<p>When you have a big project, such as updating the exterior of your home or putting on an addition, having the right renovation team is key. <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-home-addition-plan-allows-a-family-of-5-to-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alicia&#8217;s</a> Sweeten contractor added 1,000 square feet to the back of her house (<em>above</em>). Rosaire turned her garage into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/southampton-home-renovation-transforms-garage-into-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living room</a> with a pantry (<em>below</em>).</p>

<p>Molding and Built-ins</p>

<p>Sometimes a room needs a small decorative touch such as trim and millwork. Built-ins are an investment that offers a finished look and functional storage as in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Walter&#8217;s den</a> (<em>above</em>).

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>After a successful search, Jessica and Alex closed on an 800-square-foot co-op in Chelsea and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27208" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their one-bedroom, one-bathroom project</a> on </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span class="s3"><i>Sweeten</i></span></a><i>, a free renovation platform connecting homeowners with vetted general contractors.

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Guest blog post by homeowner Jessica</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We purchased the apartment with intentions to renovate. We both love architecture and design, and we wanted a place that we could make our own. The previous apartment, with its sunny balcony and endless closet space, had given us high standards, and working in real estate, I look at beautiful homes all the time. We wanted a home where we could make our mark and add the elements we craved.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43743 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Portrait-12.jpg" alt="homeowners in their newly renovated living room" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Portrait-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Portrait-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Portrait-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We were thrilled when we landed on this one-bedroom apartment, in a 1930s Chelsea co-op. The building had great bones and Art Deco details but the apartment needed work. Weâd been following Sweeten, and after closing, when we knew the reno was imminent, we looked to the service for direction. </span><span class="s2">We wanted to create a clean, modern space marrying traditional and contemporary design elements accented with our personal twists. Throughout, we planned to incorporate art and photos from our travels.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Living in</span><span class="s2"> the apartment for about half a year and bringing</span><span class="s1"> our Sweeten contractor onboard brought the project into focus. We wanted to rethink the closet layouts and planned to </span><span class="s4">update the living roomâs custom built-ins</span><span class="s1">. We were also looking for a lighting solution since the courtyard-facing unit didnât get much natural light. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last but certainly not least, we planned to improve the kitchen and the </span><span class="s4">bathroom</span><span class="s1">. </span><span class="s2">A</span><span class="s1">dditional cosmetic and electrical updates included new doors and hardware and USB outlets throughout the apartment. Our contractor was patient, listening to our thoughts (lots of them), answering questions andâmost of allâassuring us that he could get the job done, within our time constraints and with the level of quality we were hoping for.</span><span class="s1">Â </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">A narrow galley kitchen? Yes. And we love it.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Closets and storage came first. Weâd known when we purchased the apartment that we were in for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major storage deficit</a>. With our contractorâs help, we found we could reconfigure the hall and bedroom closets, which backed up to one another. We moved the interior wall, creating a larger bedroom closet with</span><span class="s2"> French doors (sliding doors can restrict access)</span><span class="s1">. Downsizing the hallway closet felt like a sacrifice, but we outfitted the space for linen-and-shoe storageâuseful and enviable extras in NYC.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43739 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="washer dryer in kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Kitchen-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The kitchen was one room where plans changed. It had been renovated and we hadnât planned on a gut-job. We love to cook and entertain, and didnât want to forego full-sized appliances, but we wanted more cupboard and counter space. </span><span class="s5">We ultimately did a full rip-and-replace</span><span class="s1">. The cabinets are </span><span class="s5">an </span><span class="s1">off-the-shelf pick that we stacked to the ceiling; it was like putting together a giant puzzle, but was good for our budget and timeline, and gave us a ton of storage. The cabinet above the dishwasher was a last-minute call to increase pantry space. </span><span class="s5">Q</span><span class="s1">uartz countertops and </span><span class="s5">a slab backsplash </span><span class="s1">give us a marble look without the maintenance</span><span class="s5">. </span><span class="s1">A narrow galley kitchen? Yes. And we love it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The </span><span class="s4">old &#8217;70s </span><span class="s2">bathroom remained, and it </span><span class="s1">was a full demo and redo</span><span class="s2">. </span><span class="s1">We replaced the peach and yellow bathroom tile, </span><span class="s2">which appeared to be original to the </span><span class="s1">building, with marble subway tile, </span><span class="s2">placed vertically for some spin. We played with metals, choosing</span><span class="s1"> an unexpected iron vanity (the countertop is quartz) and chrome hardware. </span><span class="s2">The floor tiles are porcelain, sleek and durable.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="s2">The rear-facing apartment was pin-drop quiet, but dark. The silence was </span>a luxury to us, having endured roaring sunrise garbage pickups and the revelry of late-night barhoppers. But the long living room, which also comprises the dining area, had just two windows and<span class="s2">Â no built-in light fixtures. </span>We installed recessed LED lighting in this room and it brightened the area so perfectly that we added it in the bedroom, the bath and, finally, the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The existing built-in cabinets spanning the windowed wall in the living room</span><span class="s2">Â </span><span class="s1">provided additional storage and brightened up the room with a fresh coat of white paint. We removed a floating center unit to accommodate a wall-mount TV.Â </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To finish, our Sweeten contractor detailed with all new doors and hardware and added t</span><span class="s5">hose USB outlets, which become more useful every day. </span><span class="s1">It was our idea to hang wallpaper in the foyer; the subtle raffia gives the walls texture and depth. We chose materials that would stand the test of time from both an aesthetic and durability standpoint. But it was so helpful to have an expert to guide us. There are a ton of vendors out there and our contractor had relationships with suppliers and experience with almost <a href="https://youtu.be/cr3uihyuiUo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any material available</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Our advice as first-timers is to do the research and know what you want but keep an open mind!Â </span><span class="s1">Seeing the work progress day-over-day and week-over-week was amazing, a</span><span class="s5">nd weâre so thrilled with the outcome! </span><span class="s1">Adding our stamp to this place was fun and fulfilling. What a great feeling!</span></p>

<h3>The magnetic pull of a quaint neighborhood</h3>
<p>When my husband Sergio and I started our home search, we were living in a one-bedroom rental apartment on the Upper East Side, where he had lived for almost ten years. Motivated by a desire for more space for our daughter, Lara, we began to look for an apartment to buy. During our search, we kept returning to Windsor Terrace in Brooklyn. I had lived in the borough for many years and was keen on moving back. We were drawn to its small-town neighborhood vibe and proximity to Prospect Park.</p>

<p>We purchased an approximately 1,100-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath co-op in a lovely prewar building. From the beginning, we knew we wanted to renovate the kitchen and bathroom and create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/easy-dining-room-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dining room</a> in the entry where we could gather friends and family for dinner since both of us enjoy cooking and hosting.</p>
<p>Shortly after closing, we looked to <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten to find a general contractor</a>. After meeting with several, we decided on a general contractor. He was terrific and willing to work with both our budget and strict timeline for the project. The renovation was expected to take about 10 weeks.</p>

<h3>A galley kitchen that multitasks</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley kitchen</a> was, without a doubt, the biggest part of the renovation. There were upper and lower cabinets on both sides and an open space at the far end, which could accommodate a small table and chairs.</p>
<p>Since we were already planning for a dining area outside of the kitchen, we didnât need a table in the kitchen as well. We opted to have lower cabinets run the length of the room on both sides, giving us more storage and tons of counter space. Upper cabinets were installed on one side, while custom wood shelves ran along the length of the room on the opposite side, making the kitchen feel wider and more open. The wood provides a nice contrast to the all-white kitchen, as well as some open storage and a place to display artwork.</p>
<p>With our new larger kitchen, we&#8217;ve been cooking a lot more, including lamb tagine and homemade pasta. We&#8217;re hoping to start making bread as well.</p>

<p>We selected glossy white cabinets to reflect more light. The Caesarstone counters are white with a light gray marbling and the backsplash tiles are a white matte hex. We decided to replace the linoleum tile floors with wood floors. Our Sweeten contractor did a great job matching the flooring design and color to match the wood floors in the rest of the apartment, which created a nice sense of continuity between the spaces.</p>
<p>And finally, we created a small bar area with stools, since we now had so much more countertop to work with. This has definitely become one of our favorite places to hang out in the apartment to read and have coffee in the morning while one of us cooks. Lara loves it too; sometimes she&#8217;ll sit at the counter and draw and other times she&#8217;ll want to help us prep some items for cooking.</p>
<h3>A dining room emerges with space planning</h3>

&#8220;We created a small bar area with stools since we now had so much more countertop to work with.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Before the renovation, the foyer was a long, narrow area that we wanted to transform into a dining room. We removed two large closets in the entryway, which essentially doubled the size of that space. To compensate for the loss of storage in the foyer, we added additional storage in the kitchen. Now that we have a dedicated dining room that opens into the living area, we can display our artwork consisting primarily of portraitsâa mix of photographs, paintings, and drawings.</p>

<p>In the master bedroom, we removed a wall of closets and cabinets that was added on at some point. We opted to replace it with a freestanding wardrobe instead.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38051 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-03.jpg" alt="white bathroom with black fixtures and subway tile" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-03-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-03-723x1084.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-03-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Creating a black-and-white bathroom</h3>
<p>The bathroom was fairly small in size, so our goal was to make it feel as open as possible. We installed a wall-mounted sink without a base and a slightly narrower toilet. Fortunately, there is a closet in the bathroom so storage was not an issue. Above the sink, we installed a large mirrored cabinet with LED lighting, which also helps make the room feel a bit bigger. We kept the color scheme a simple black and white with black fixtures.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/first-time-renovators-share-their-stories-vol-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As first-time renovators</a>, we greatly appreciated how responsive our Sweeten contractor was to our calls and emails throughout the renovation. In the few instances where something needed to be adjusted or redone, he was willing to take the extra steps to make sure we were satisfied with the outcome.</p>
<p>Overall, we are really happy with the finished product. Our new space feels open and has a great flow. We were able to keep many of the original prewar details that attracted us to our Windsor Terrace apartment in Brooklyn. We absolutely love our new kitchen and bathroom. We feel lucky we were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched up with our contractor</a>. He was honest and clear with us throughout the process in terms of what would and would not be possible and what the costs would be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>When kids flee the coop, itâs time for change</h2>
<p>Grown children leaving the nest gives parents an opportunity to rethink their lifestyle and their home. For some, that means turning an old bedroom into a gym or office, but for these renovators, it meant tackling kitchens, bathrooms, and living areas to best suit their needs. From a couple looking to downsize to one returning home, learn more about their stories below.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30234 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-723x482.jpg" alt="empty nester remodel, kitchen, living room" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-rental-becomes-a-cozy-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JoAnn and Brian</a> wanted to leave their 4,800-square-foot house in New Jersey to make a one-bedroom they already owned in Manhattan their new home. &#8220;Living in Manhattan had always been a desire. Since we were empty-nesters and our daughter was already living in the city, we decided to renovate our 600-square-foot rental apartment for ourselves,&#8221; they shared. While downscaling by over 4,000-square-feet definitely presented a challenge, a focus on storage in the kitchen and bedroom closets set them up for success.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25237 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg" alt="empty nester remodel, bathroom, renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25235 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-02-723x482.jpg" alt="empty nester remodel, bathroom, renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>The guest bathroom in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/75-year-old-hall-bathroom-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ann and Frankâs</a> three-bedroom apartment was almost all original from 1929. They bought the apartment in 1992, but wanted to wait to renovate until their two kids had left home. Their wish list included having a separate walk-in shower in addition to a new tub. To make room for a walk-in shower, they removed the storage closet next to the door. Otherwise, the footprint remained as is, while new tiles and fixtures contributed to the transformation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33864 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a-723x482.jpg" alt="empty nester remodel, kitchen" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-nyc-homecoming-prompts-a-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Margery and Jim</a>Â had been waiting for their opportunity to return to New York City. &#8220;Jim and I originally worked in New York and then Jim got transferred. We lived in the suburbs of Philadelphia for about 20 years and then when the kids grew up, we said now&#8217;s our chance to move back to the city, because we&#8217;re really city people,&#8221; Margery shared.Â They purchased an apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops with incredible views that also needed some work. After living in the apartment for six months, they were ready to remodel. The couple worked with their Sweeten general contractor to bring their industrial-meets-modern vision to life, and take down walls to maximize natural light.</p>

<h3>Falling for a new Manhattan neighborhood</h3>
<p>Sonali, a consultant, and Shalaj, an investment banker, were initially unsure about their move to the Financial District in Manhattan, but soon found themselves falling in love with the neighborhood. âWe enjoy going on long walks along the river and just exploring the shops and restaurants in the area,â Sonali said. One night, while walking their cocker spaniel, Tyson, the couple discovered the Southbridge Towers complex, which had recently been privatized. Although they hadnât considered buying before, the building piqued their curiosity. They started going to open houses and putting in their bids but were outbid several times before finally being accepted for a 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom co-op. âTruth be told, we were not expecting our offer to get accepted!â Sonali said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As the two settled into their new roles as homeowners, they said, âreality hitâ and they realized the apartment (with its original &#8217;70s design) would need a complete overhaul: a gut renovation. âWe had no idea where to start,â Sonali said. Luckily, thatâs when they found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post their Financial District renovation</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">âWe needed to renovate the entire apartment, including the removal of the original popcorn ceiling. We wanted a contractor who would not only handle all aspects of the renovation but also fit within our tight budget and schedule,â she said. The project would also include knocking down walls, which required permits from both their building and the city. They were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a> who was comfortable with their project scope and timeline.</p>

<h3>Expanding the kitchen, and compromising along the way</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sonali and Shalaj agreed that the most important change to tackle would be opening up the <span style="color: #000000;">kitchen</span>. âWe both enjoy cooking and having friends over, so we knew we would be spending a lot of time in there,â Sonali said. They decided to remove a kitchen wall to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-plan-living-when-lounging-meets-dining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open the space</a> into the living room and make the whole apartment feel less cramped. They went with a white-on-white design, with white cabinets, a white subway tile backsplash, and white quartz countertops throughout (which Sonali called âexquisiteâ).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of installing a microwave over the gas range, they opted for a drawer-style instead. &#8220;It reminded Shalaj of years of renting!&#8221; Sonali said. Another item they really wanted was a Wolf gas range. &#8220;It was way beyond our stove budget, but when our contractor told us about a discounted floor model, we decided to splurge on it,â she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35881 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06-723x482.jpg" alt="Financial District, renovation, apartment renovation, home, design, construction" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An unexpected delight in the kitchen was the under-cabinet LED lights with dimmers, suggested by the contractor, which both added charmÂ and accentuated the white subway tile backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the process,Â the couple found they had to compromise on certain elements. For example, because of the location of the gas line, they couldnât move the stove away from the peninsula as originally planned. Sonali found the silver lining, though: âWe like that the stove is in the peninsula now because it allows us to cook and interact with guests when we have them over!â They spent most of their effort and money on the kitchen. âWe have not regretted any of our decisions yet,â she said.</p>

<h3>Adding closet space to the co-op</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next renovation priority was toÂ double the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closet space</a> in the<span style="color: #000000;"> master bedroom by taking the adjacent guest bedroom&#8217;s closet; the second bedroom got a new one of its own built.Â âIn our last rental, Shalaj was relegated</span> to the living room closet, so having enough storage space in the master bedroom was pretty high on his list of priorities,â Sonali explained. Shalaj wanted to install lights in their custom closets, but once they realized this addition would add thousands of dollars to their renovation costs, they decided to buy battery-operated lights instead.</p>

<h3>A bathroom refresh &amp; pet-friendly wooden flooring</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple decided to close up the living room closet and have it open inside the <span style="color: #000000;">bathroom</span>. This change added <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> to the bathroom and got rid of wasted space in the hallway. Like the kitchen, the bathroom was also mostly white. To add contrast and character, they installed black hexagonal floor tile. âWe get complimented on it a lot!â Sonali said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the rest of the apartment, the contractor installed wide-plank, oak hardwood floors. Sonali described the color as ânot too dark, not too lightâ and loves that it blends with Tysonâs furâsomething relatable to any pet owner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-selecting-and-ordering-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">choosing materials</a>, Sonali said that the couple had no idea how many choices there would be or how much it could end up costing. Thatâs where their contractor came in: âTo help us work through our sticker shock, our contractor had carefully built a list of items in three categories (budget, standard, and high-end) and supplied samples, to the extent possible. From there, our job was mostly to choose one of the three options provided, which made life so much easier for us,â she said.</p>

<h3>Lessons learned from the Financial District renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most stressful moment of the renovation came a week before the couple was supposed to move into their new apartment. None of the appliances had been installed, there was paper all over the floor, and the electrical work had not yet been started. Since they were unable to stay in their old apartment, theyÂ worried they might not have anywhere to go. The Sweeten contractor reassured them the process wasnât very far behind schedule, and sure enough, they were able to move in on time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">âOur contractor took great control of the project, from getting building approval to ensuring that we could meet the move-in deadline.â She added, âWe had heard horror stories about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how long renovations</a> can take, but working with an experienced and responsible contractor makes the process much smoother.â</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The coupleâs advice to new renovators? âA friend of ours had advised us to set aside a 30% buffer on top of our budget.Â The advice came in handy as that was almost exactly the amount we went over by.â Extra costsÂ included a few items outside the original scope such as replacing the AC unit and also spending more on kitchen materials than had been initially planned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sonali said, &#8220;We love our new space and feel lucky to find a home in our favorite neighborhood and to addÂ our personal touch to the layout and materials.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thank you, Sonali andÂ Shalaj, for sharing your new home with us!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Seven serene retreats with tucked-in storage</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the rest of your home, your bedroom is a place to surround yourself with the things you love. It&#8217;s also a place for more personal trinkets and mementos, which means storage for those (and, of course, all your clothes) is key. By incorporating custom built-ins, floating shelves, and even a hidden closet, these Sweeten homeowners&#8217; private spaces are certain to inspire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-22583 noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22583 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="bedroom renovation, serene, storage, neutral" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-22585 noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22585 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="bedroom renovation, closet, serene, storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The large bedroom in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/interior-designer-rearranges-order-bedroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whitney and Laurence&#8217;s</a>Â apartment was a huge plusâthe awkward closet layout was anything but. Their contractor knocked down the four separate closets and created one dressing room to accommodateÂ both of their wardrobes. Careful planning left ample room for two large dressers, plus a king-size bed. To top it off, their feng shui consultant advised on the furniture plan and placement to summon the harmonious, well-organized bedroom of their dreams.<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft18.gif" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-30381 noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-30381 noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30418 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft20-723x1085.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom in this <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-greenwich-village-loft-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowner&#8217;s</a>Â apartment boasted stunning natural light thanks to its west-facing windowsâit just needed some minor storage reconfiguration to bring it up to snuff. To take advantage of the high ceilings, the contractor built open shelving across the length of the room. The original closet was moved between the bedroom and bathroom, and reimagined as a walk-in dressing room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22186" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-21-723x482.jpg" alt="bedroom with built-in and window seat" width="723" height="482" /><br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22187" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-22-723x482.jpg" alt="close-up of built-in and window seat in bedroom" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/">Claudia</a> set out to redesign her bedroom, a window seat was at the top of her list, along with the need for more storage. In order to meet both demands, a multi-functional built-in was designed around the casement to house books and keepsakes. Staying true to her vision, a custom seat was added and topped with an upholstered cushion to create a cozy spot for curling up with a good book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22191 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedroom with double closets" width="723" height="482" /><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-16-2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-20415"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-20415 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-16-2-723x1085.jpg" alt="sweeten_hari_apartment-16" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hari-kaitys-living-room-closet-renovation-brooklyn-heights/">Hari and Kaity&#8217;s</a> apartment had limited closet space and lots of square footage left over for furniture. To address growing storage concerns, the coupleÂ decided to use the far wall of the bedroom to build outÂ a pair of full-size closets filled with custom shelving and storage. Now that they have plenty of room to store clothing and more, the original closet was transformed into an office nook.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22188" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_MarioApt-06-723x517.jpg" alt="Modern bedroom with floating shelves" width="723" height="517" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a redesign of their apartment knocked down most of the walls in favor of an open-plan arrangement, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened/">Mario and Joe</a>Â realized they needed more wall space to display their growing treasures from travels around the globe. Stacked floating shelves in their bedroom became the perfect solution to showcase their collection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22189" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-11-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedroom with built-in for books" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a large assembly of books and a serious lack of storage space, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/christines-art-filled-upper-west-side-redesign-and-renovation-sweetened/">Christine</a> turned to the nearly blank canvas of her bedroom for a thoughtful solution. The wall behind her bed was transformed into a library with a custom built-in that reaches from floor to ceiling, while a pewter paint finish softens the predominantly white space. Key elements for a personal library include wall sconces that are essential for reading in bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22190 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="White bedroom with dressing room attached" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22203" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-11-1-723x482.jpg" alt="White bedroom with dressing room attached" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-11-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-11-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-11-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-11-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By preserving the wall between the bedroom and newly created walk-in dressing room, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/">Jerry and Janet</a> were able to move the closet out of sight while keeping it easily accessible. Positioning the bed in the middle of the room with the dressing area behind the headboard adds an interesting architectural element to the space. The streamlined design also complements the original 1910 window moldings that were painted black for a touch of contrast.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovate a master bathroom in Pelham, New York</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>:Â In advance of moving into their newly purchasedÂ Pelham home, a three-bedroom, two-bathroom in Westchester, Alexy and her husband decided to get some necessary renovations out of the way. The couple had a five-year-old andÂ were pregnant with their second child. They were still living in Brooklyn, which made this reno project one that would beÂ done from afar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The house only had showers, which arenât ideal for bathing infants. They decided to add a tub to the second-floor bathroom, which had already undergone a renovation by the previous owner that had stolen some space from the neighboring bedroom. âThe bedroom closet was just a few inches deep with some shelves,â Alexy said.

<p style="text-align: justify;">TheÂ <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor they chose</a>Â took space from the hallway to add a large linen closet to the bathroom. &#8220;It holds a lot, and that is exactly what I wanted,â said Alexy. The redistributed hallway space also provided the extra room needed to add a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tub</a> to the shower area. Alexyâs husband originally wanted a double vanity, but there just wasnât enough room. After much soul-searching, he decided what he really wanted was adequate counter space. The vanity they went with had a counter that stretched to the wall while adding more <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> underneath.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>:Â The project was finished pretty much on time except for the vanity, which took a long time to be delivered, but their Sweeten contractor stuck to the budget and theyÂ encountered no surprises.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Brett</i></span></p>
<h3>In need of something bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way and an energetic dog named Alfie, Terri Lee and Brett Appel needed a larger apartment. The couple had a design advantage from the start: Brett runs his own custom residential architecture practice and Terri works for one of the largest architecture firms in New York. They wanted to find something that they could gut renovate and design to their own specifications.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30.jpg" alt="Brett sitting on a chair posing for photo near built-in book shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51517" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A completely gutted remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath apartment was in an 82-unit co-op in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. It was in terrible condition, which made it easier to rip everything out and redesign the apartment exactlyÂ the way they wanted. They found their contractor after talking with friends (one of whom is also an architect) whoÂ <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had used Sweeten</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08.jpg" alt="open living and dining with hardwood floors and white walls and half wall book shelves as room divider or partition after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51495" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terri and Brett posted their project</a> on Sweeten, they wereÂ upfront about the existing conditions and scope of work. TheyÂ wanted a contractor who would tell them whether the work could be done within their budget, or if they needed to scale back. âFortunately, we found the right contractor who was very happy to work with us so we could get everything we wanted,â Brett said.</p>

<h3>Making the space look bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The coupleâs design vision was to combine shades of gray with natural wood to make theÂ home seem as bright and large as possible without being too monotone. âWe also didnât want the renovated space to compete with our brightly colored furniture,â Brett said. Their primary objective in terms of gaining space was to add a second bathroom, which they achieved by rearranging the bedroom doors and reducing the size of the hallway closets.</p>

<h3>Challenges in the foyer</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The entryÂ foyer was a bit of a challenge. Itâs two steps above the living room and contains the dining space, which was small. They relocated the steps down to the living room from the center to the side and replaced the guardrails with a continuous double-sided built-in bookcase custom-designed by the contractorâs millworker. The raised platform was extended to create a larger dining space, while the closet expanded for more stroller storage. New wide-plank European oak engineered flooring was installed throughout.</p>

<h3>Rearranging the walls</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they found the apartment, the existing walls were plasterâprobably at least 60 years old and poorly done. âOne of the walls in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room was so uneven and bumpy</a>, it looked like it was made out of pillowcases,â Brett recalled. They ultimately decided to fur out the wallsâa process to construct a new wall in front of the old one. âWe attachedÂ 1x3s to the existing wall and then put new sheetrock on those. We lost a little space (about 1 1/2&#8243; per wall), but this saved us about $6,000,â Brett said. The other option to straighten crooked walls would have been &#8220;demolishing the plaster and lathe, placing new studs, and then new sheetrock,&#8221; whichÂ would have been more expensive and time-consuming.</p>

<h3>Covering the radiator</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The master bedroom closet was reframed to function as a walk-in. Other details included the custom radiator covers in the bedroom and living room, crafted by the millworker; leftover stone from the kitchen counters was used for the radiator sills.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Terri and Brett designed these covers together. The existing radiators had an old painted steel cover that had not weathered very well.Â The millworker made the slatted fronts on removable clips so the radiator could be accessedÂ for maintenance. The new millwork needed a top/windowsill butÂ the couple decided that painted MDF would not last very long. Brett had to purchase two slabs of stone for the kitchen to cover the countertops and backsplash. There was a lot of leftover stone that easily fit the sills.</p>

<h3>An ADA-compliant layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">âWe didnât have a lot of flexibility designing the kitchen and bathroom layouts. It had to be ADA-compliant since we rearranged everything,â Brett explained. They focused on finishes. In the kitchen, theyÂ imagined the countertops and backsplashÂ as the âfeatureâÂ elements with everything else as the background, &#8220;which is why the floors and cabinets are all different shades of gray,â he said. The couple loves unique, natural stones andÂ found that quartzites have the most movement and veining, which worked well with their gray cabinets.</p>

<span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Master bath</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both bathrooms were made to seem bigger and brighter by making the walls white andÂ using marble tile in the master and subway tile in the guest. In the master bath, Brett said, he âhad some fun connecting the shower niche with the existing windowsill.â Terri scoured the Internet to find an aquatic-themed wallpaper for the guest bathroom.Â Wood shelves were incorporated in each to provide a little warmth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brett was most excited about the new rain shower in the added bathroom. âAll of my previous apartmentsâfor basically my entire lifeâonly had a bathtub, so it feels very luxurious to shower in a large glass box,â he said.</p>

<h3>A recommendation for clients</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the renovation, Brett had wanted to test out Sweetenâs service to see if he would recommend it to his own clients. After this experience, he said he would. âWe didnât need much assistance from Sweeten because I have experience managing projects like these professionally, but I felt reassured knowing that Sweeten would be able to assist if any serious problems came up. Luckily, our contractor was great and we didnât have any issues,â Brett said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Terri and I are perpetually impressed that we were able to design the apartment exactly to our needs,&#8221; says Brett. &#8220;Our families come over frequently now and we love that we were able to add a second bathroom. It really helps make âourâ space feel more private.&#8221; As an architect couple, they worked well together. &#8220;It helps to come up with a central concept or theme at the beginning,&#8221; Brett said. &#8220;There will always be disagreements but we could then ask ourselves &#8216;does this fit our initial vision&#8217; and make a decision together.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">ForÂ 18 years, home for JoAnn and Brian was a 6-bedroom, 4,800-square-foot Colonial in Chesterfield, New Jersey. As they neared retirement, however, they decided that they wanted to move to Manhattanâa lifelong desire. Their daughter was living in New York City, and the couple already owned an investment property in the Turtle Bay neighborhood that could be converted to their primary residence. The apartment, a one-bedroom co-op measuring 600 square feet, had been rented out for over a decade.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30237 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store_Before07-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store_Before07" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30236 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bath and living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store10-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment was tired and worn, and âtotally not my style,â says JoAnn. âThe kitchen was completely outdated and ugly. I like to cook and wanted more storage and a larger work area. I needed room for all my appliances and a large countertop for prepping. We didnât add more appliances, though, just bought new and better-quality ones.â The kitchen was walled off from the living area and the entryway with narrowly-arched pass-throughs, which made the space feel smaller than it actually was. The plan for the bathroom, whichÂ required a refresh, was to swap out the tub for a large walk-in shower. Storage was to be incorporated throughout the home wherever possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store18.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30240 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store18-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30241" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store20.gif" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store20" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As experienced renovators (with four renovations under their belts!), JoAnn and Brian knew it would be beneficial to hire a licensed contractor who was experienced with local rules and regulations. Since their contacts were all in New Jersey, they were at a loss for where to turn. Then, one day while they were watching the Sunday morning news, they saw a commercial for <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors. âWe immediately <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/17138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filled out the easy online form</a> and were matched with three different contractors.Â <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">After meeting our Sweeten contractor</a>, we knew right away we wanted to work with him. This turned out to be our best decision!â</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The duo got to work on a design with their contractor that would allow them to downsize comfortably from a six-bedroom house to a one-bedroom apartment (no easy feat). Their biggest concern was storage. Their Sweeten contractor <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redesigned the existing closets</a> to maximize usable area and even found a place to add a new closet in the hallway adjacent to the master bedroom. To keep the apartment âsimple, so it doesnât feel too crowded,â says JoAnn, the kitchen counter stools swivel toward the living room and act as additional seating.Â A pull-out sofa in the living room does double duty for overnight guests.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, their Sweeten contractor took all of JoAnn and Brianâs ideas and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created a space</a>Â with the prep surfaces they needed, while also housing their cooking tools. They chose to leave the footprint as it was, changing out everything else. Rental-grade cabinetry was replaced with custom Shaker-style cabinetry in two tones.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30245 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store04-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store04" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30243" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store02-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store02" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Along the back wall, which holds the new Bertazzoni stove, Bosch dishwasher, and Liebherr refrigerator, the cabinetry is floor-to-ceiling white. The peninsula sports a dark wood for contrast. Both sides are topped with white Caesarstone counters. Glass subway tile backsplash and a larger-format gray tile on the floors complete the look.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30260 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store_Before08-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store_Before08" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30247 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store11-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store11" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30248" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store13-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store13" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bath, out went the old tub. In its place, their Sweeten contractor installed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk-in shower</a> divided from the rest of the bath with a piece of frameless glass for a more open feel. Gray mosaic tiles in complementary shapesâa hex in the shower and a weave in the rest of the roomâwere chosen for floors. White subway tile on the walls kept things simple, and a modern vanity provided much-needed storage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30246 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store14-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store14" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30249" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store15-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store15" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next to the vanity, the contractor found room behind the wall, so he opened it up to add floor-to-ceilingÂ built-in shelving, which JoAnn and Brian use for toiletries and small decorative objects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom and living room were overhauled with new paint and doors. Yet another archway leading from the bedroom area to the living room was removed for more airiness overhead.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30250" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store19.gif" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store19" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They reported a seamless experience working with their Sweeten contractor: âWe sent him many pictures of what we liked and he really paid attention,&#8221; said JoAnn. &#8220;We are extremely happy with all the choices. Their work ethic was exemplary. They showed up on time and made themselves available when we needed them. They were conscious of our budget. The contractor and his team were very respectful to our neighbors so as not to disturb anyone. They kept everything neat and orderly. Our apartment was completed in a timely fashion and exceeded our expectations!â</p>

<p><em>Tara, a former teacher-turned-homemaker, and Ryan, a software developer, had always loved the 1800s cast-iron buildings in the SoHo district of NYC.

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2012, we had the opportunity to buy a loft in a former silk importer warehouse and fell in love with the possibilities. The space showcased several classic neighborhood features, such as cast-iron Corinthian columns, 13-foot tin ceilings, oversized windows, and exposed brick walls. However, it also needed a lot of work. The kitchen and bathroom were dated. The bamboo flooring was uneven. There was no storage and the only bedroom had a divider instead of a full wall. We lived in the space for a few years while we considered our options. Then we got pregnant with our son, Wyatt, so we decided to act fast to make room for our new family addition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our renovation vision was to embrace the original loft aesthetic with an industrial-meets-modern design. We wanted to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-homes-discover-the-raw-appeal-of-exposed-brick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-expose the brick</a> along the entire length of the living room wall. It was a similar case in the master bedroom, where we wanted to add an accent wall. The columns and original tin ceiling would be left untouched; we loved their rustic, industrial character. That raw look would contrast with the clean, modern, and white gloss cabinetry in the kitchen and living room built-ins that we wanted. The brands we chose were based on quality, modern aesthetic, and resale value.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We were unsure of what to expect when the brick in the living room would be exposed. In addition to finding a few more steam, electrical, and drain pipes than expected, we also uncovered a square archway (the brick wall was a firewall running down the center beam of the building and the arch was a former large doorway from its time as a warehouse). During the co-op conversion, these archways were covered by standard framing and wallboard to separate the apartments. However, the feature was aesthetically unpleasing. We solved the problem by covering the drywall and turning it into a âfeature wallâ with reclaimed barn siding. Finally, we showcased the wall with down-lit recessed lightingâan idea we got from a movie. To keep the dÃ©cor minimalistic, we made maximum use of our new storage. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> along much of the living room wall are compartmentalized for baby toys, books, media, and our vinyl collection. On the opposite wall sits a desk for paperwork and musical inspiration; Ryan has played the guitar since he was 13 and hopes his son, Wyatt, inherits his passion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the kitchen, we essentially kept the same layout. We had looked at several floor plan options that would have potentially altered the kitchen/bathroom layout and location. After exploring those options, we realized moving those âwetâ spaces over our downstairs neighborâs âdryâ living room would drastically increase the cost and complexity of our project. We did push the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen island</a> out (toward the dining area) about a foot. That improved the ergonomics of the kitchen, particularly when navigating an inconveniently located cast-iron column. We replaced the cabinets, which gave us the flexibility to tweak the functionality, such as replacing the range on the former island with an induction <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooktop</a>. That left room in the island for three rows of deep drawers, which was a much better use of space for storing pans, utensils, and cookware than cabinets. We also found room to add an 18â wine fridge in the island.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-ovens-power-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall and speed oven combination</a> moved to the back wall, formerly dead counter space for a microwave and toaster oven. We did consider whether the column would interfere with the kitchen flow, especially with ovens on the other side. But it ended up working out fine. The high-traffic area (sink, refrigerator, cooktop) is together on one side of the column. The sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator were replaced but stayed in exactly the same locations, requiring minimal plumbing. Even though we added appliances, we gained storage space just by reconfiguring and making better use of the space we had.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29286 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-08.gif" alt="" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer-dryer combo unit</a> had been in a column directly facing the kitchen island, a terrible location for laundry for traffic flowâand hygiene. The water heater was directly above the washer-dryer, making the whole section difficult to move. The simple solution was to rotate theÂ units 180 degrees, so that laundry door was accessed next to the bathroom, which made more sense. The water heater was left as is.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A big priority was to formally close off the master bedroom. Working with a 100-year-old former warehouse came with some challenges. One was a column near the bedroom. Although it is beautiful, it just happened to get in the way of every floor plan. Working with our architect, we had to be creative in positioning the bedroom walls in a way to maximize their floor space while working around the columns. Using <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pocket doors</a> helped solved the problem since the column would have left no room for standard hinge doors. Storage was a priority throughout the loft. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master closet</a> is a wall-sized, reach-in, modular custom closet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the babyâs room, we took some space from the living room to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-is-a-legal-bedroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add the second bedroom</a>. Carving outÂ the space was a challenge when constrained by the column, windows, door placement, and not taking too muchÂ square footage out of the master. In the end, we were just barely able toÂ segmentÂ an 8-foot x 10-foot room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom had a clean, modern makeoverÂ with oversized floor-to-ceiling marble tiles. The floor plan stayed the same, but we were able to make substantial improvements with a few minor design adjustments. Once we demoâd, we found that the half-height wet wall behind the pedestal vanity was overbuilt and could be moved inward. This reclaimed a few inches of space needed for the new floating vanity. We also framed out a LED-lit, recessed shelf above this wet wall, giving the area more purpose. The medicine cabinet was set inside the wall, saving some airspace. These little adjustments made the wall feel a few inches deeper and between the shelf, floating vanity, and medicine cabinet, it provided a lot more storage.Â Above the bathroomâs dropped ceiling, and with a lot of maneuvering, we made space for the blower of the new ducted central air system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As is common in New York City, our apartment was heated with building-controlled steam heat. Our unit got a disproportionate share of that heat. In frustration, we removed the steam radiator altogether while adding a heating and cooling central air system. We also replaced the worn-down bamboo tiles with new white oak <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/">hardwood floors</a>Â throughout the rest of the apartment,Â <span style="color: #333333;">which we painted a designer white. </span>It keeps the whole space feeling open and bright.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten was great in helping us realize our vision. They understood our scope of work and did a great job at pairing us with excellent contractor options. Then, they walked us through the contractor selection process, helping us make an apples-to-apples comparison of the bids. The Sweeten contractor we ultimately chose to work with turned out to be an excellent pick. They became true partners in our process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One tip we want to pass on to future renovators is, if possible, rent a place close by so you can check in a few times a week. We did and were able to do weekly (sometimes multiple times per week) walk-throughs with our contractor. That gave us time to plan, troubleshoot, and exchange creative ideas. They also usedÂ software to track all aspects of the project, including timelines, material selections, work pictures<span style="font-weight: 400;">â</span>all of which was tremendously helpful and well organized, allowing us to complete our project within the planned four months. Sadly, a friendâs renovation that is similar to ours and started at the same time is still going.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most exciting part of this process is seeing our vision come to life. And getting storage because babies come with so much stuff!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to our double issue to celebrate the long holiday weekend!Â Below, you will find posts that represent our greatest home renovation hits featuring some ofÂ our readers&#8217;Â most favoriteÂ kitchen, bathroom, and entire homeÂ renos on our blog and on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sweeten_home/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.Â Each homeowner came to Sweeten for help and after the project was complete took the time to share their renovation journeys with usâand you. Weâre out scouting new projects next week, and will be back in full swing with the next newsletter the following week. Have a great 4th!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam and Seanâs transformation of an outdated, cookie-cutter kitchen in their Clinton Hill home got a lot of attention on our blog. Taking down a few walls opened up the space, making the room feel larger and brighter. Mix-and-match countertops create a customized look, pairing Caesarstone in Frosty Carrina with butcher block for the top of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank">peninsula</a>. Plus, graphite cabinets are a welcome departure from more neutral shades with bronze knobs for contrast. We also think our readers loved this post because Sam finished the renovation while pregnant with child number three!</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tina, who happens to be an architect, drew up a new future for her kitchen; taking down walls, expanding <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank">storage</a>, and devising a color scheme that would really pop. New cabinets were painted in Newburyport Blue by Benjamin Moore, a bold move that adds character and charm. For a striking contrast, the white subway tile backsplash and countertopsâanother appearance of Frosty Carrina quartz by Caesarstoneâkeep the space feeling bright and make it easy to understand why it was such a hit with our followers!</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rimaâs renovation made her home feel like a different world altogether with a unique take on the modern bath that resonated withÂ our readers. Needing serious updates, her bath received a new toilet, tub, sink, fixtures, vanity, tiles, and flooring. Porcelain <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank">floor tile</a> with a faux-wood finish adds warmth and character while white subway tile lends a classic look. Rima wanted the bathroom to feel modern and have plenty of storage made possible by a two-drawer vanity, plus wall and medicine cabinets.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen and Ben wanted a fresh and modern bathâlike so many of our followersâso they planned on keeping it minimalist. A black hexagon floor tile with bright white grout adds a lot of visual interest while an inventive side-table-turned-vanity brings a touch of warmth and rustic charm. Plus, double medicine cabinets provide lots of sleek <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank">storage</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laurenâs impossibly charming studio is a marriage of modern and cozy and garnered the attention of our readers as well as </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/getting-organized-in-a-tiny-apartment.html" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Looking to create a clean, fresh, and calm feel, Lauren set out on a complete home renovation. The studio apartment especiallyÂ needed help with storage since the larger closet had been converted into a small office by the previous tenant. Our favorite update: two closet makeovers that allowed Lauren to optimize her storage, making plenty of room for a serious shoe collection. Plus, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank">refinished</a> wood floors got a darker shade that changed the tone of the room, adding richness and a level of sophistication.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christine had all the floors <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank">painted</a> white in her apartment, boosting the brightness of her space and drawing the attention of our followers. The white in the bedroom is balanced by exposed brick and wood tones, amping up the coziness factor. A slim corner sink and medicine cabinet in the bathroom, plus white subway tile, transform a once dark and cramped space into a relaxing retreat. In the living room, a collection plants placed in front of another brick wall inspired by Moroccan riadsâa traditional house with an interior gardenâcreate a soothing vibe. See the full makeover <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/fashion-designer-renovates-match-style/" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Closet and platform bed storage highlight an alcove studio</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we published Lauren&#8217;s studio renovation in October of 2016, we found ourselves obsessed with everything in it, from theÂ thoughtfulÂ design to the clever storage sprinkled throughout. And we weren&#8217;t the only ones. <em>The New York Times</em> covered Lauren&#8217;s home shortly after, (see below) featuring her space in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/getting-organized-in-a-tiny-apartment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Organized in a Tiny Apartment</a>, an article focused on living smallâyet smartâin the big city. Since many of you have set the goal of getting organized once and for all, we thought it was time for another look at this inspiring home.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29653 size-chrono" title="Lauren's feature in The New York Times" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-723x781.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="723" height="781" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-723x781.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-278x300.jpg 278w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-600x648.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>With a year left on her lease,Â timingÂ was not an issue when Lauren closed on her new studio co-op in impossibly charming Brooklyn Heights. But with a desk where a master closet could be and a teeny closet where a chic workspace could be, Lauren needed some help to renovate before settling in. Read on for this first-time homeownerâs take onÂ kitchen, bathroom, closet,Â and flooring updates throughout her lovely home.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Guest post by Lauren, Brooklyn Heights homeowner</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I started looking for an apartment last fall, I had no idea what to expect. I had narrowed my ideal location to Brooklyn Heights for its proximity to Manhattan and quaint feel. Once I saw the listing for this co-op apartment online, I knew it ticked all of my boxes and was ecstatic when my offer was accepted. I had time on my side as I still had about a year left on my current lease (did not think the buying process would happen as quickly as it did) and I decided the apartment could use some updates to fit my style and taste a bit more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The space gets a lot of light and has a great view of the East River. I wanted to update the bathroom, darken the floors, and optimize storage space in the apartment. The way the previous owner had utilized storage space did not make sense to me; there was a large home office in a closet in the main living space and a small closet in theÂ bed loft area. The bed loft also had a trap door for storage that was only accessible under the bed. I had no idea where to start looking for a contractor, but I remembered reading about an apartment renovation with Sweeten on <em>Apartment Therapy</em>. On a whim, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I posted my project</a>, and I waited to see what sort of responses I would get.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted the apartment to have a clean, fresh, modern, and calm feel with optimized storage to reduce clutter. I had most of my finishes and materials selected before starting the renovation, which made everything that much easier. I got two matches initially and then worked with Sweeten to line up more so I had more bids to compare. I met with four contractors and after much deliberation, I decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The one I choseÂ completely understood my vision and desired style for the apartment. I asked him at one of our first meetings if there was anything that I hadnât included in the scope of the renovation that I should have, and he immediately mentioned <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating</a> the walls and ceilings. The thought had never crossed my mind, butÂ he pointed out the bowed beams on the ceiling and uneven surface on the walls. He educated me on why it was the best route to make this impactful update.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the start, I knew that it would be difficult to darken the maple floors. Maple is a notoriously difficult wood to introduce stain, and I could tell from a preliminary search on Google just how hard it would be to accomplish.Â My contractor and his team did not back down from this challenge. They tried to go the normal route of staining first, and after the first round of testing and samples, we knew this would not give the desired result. They investigated different dyes and proper techniques for mixing the dyes and application. After some trial and error (and lots of labor), the floors turned out great!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To match my floors,Â my contractor re-built the bed loft platform out of the same maple flooring (as it was previously just plywood). He integrated a better storage solution under the bed loft, creating three bays to store off-season clothes and a folding table and chairs for extra guests. He also installed <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoe molding and base molding</a> throughout. In the bed loft area, after removing an existing closet,Â he created a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/home-office-desk-nooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in desk nook</a>.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29635 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, the existing stove was quite small at 24â and I really like to cook and wanted a standard size range. Replacing the range proved difficult as the existing cabinetry configuration did not allow for a range with 30â of width. With some creativity, my contractor came up with the solution by notching out the cabinets by a half inch on either side, shifting one cabinet down, and making it into a cookbook shelf at my request. This allowed me to get a full-size Samsung 30â gas range.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29636 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29637 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Replacing the range also meant replacing the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a>. I knew I wanted to change the existing dark marble countertops for a light-colored quartz option. I discovered that Pental Quartz Thassos was the brightest white quartz to complement the white gloss Ikea cabinets that I was leaving in place. The same material was used to make new windowsills as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen was also updated with a new sink, faucet, dishwasher, refrigerator, marble backsplash, and new under-cabinet lighting. My contractor came up with another great idea to add a soffit on top of the kitchen cabinets to finish off the look. The kitchen lighting was replaced, swapping out three pendants for one large lantern pendant.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29643 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the fact that the bathtub was too short for its location really bugged me. There also was a very odd triangular corner which I thought was a terrible waste of space. Working with my contractor, I am so pleased with how the bathroom turned out. It feels like a mini spa.Â HeÂ squared off the triangular corner and broke through the wall to the exterior hallway, making the triangular corner into a linen closet that&#8217;s accessible right outside the bathroom. I added a drop-in tub that fits the space better and opened it up by replacing the shower curtain with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass shower panel</a>. The tinted shower tile gives the otherwise all-white bathroom a refreshing pop of color. New shower lighting highlights the unique color of the tile. The fixtures are from Kohler, as is the vanity.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN-Lauren-DeCaro-Closet.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29646 mb-0 size-full" title="closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN-Lauren-DeCaro-Closet.gif" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="816" height="1224" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My contractor came up with a great idea for closets and went with larger 8-foot closet doors to make the space feel more expansive and draw your eye up to the beams. We replaced all the doors with single panel doors and simple chrome hardware. Two closets were customized by California Closets whileÂ the contractor and his team built shelving in the other two closets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They also built a cover for the AC/heat unit in the living room, with the front panel mimicking the same style as the bathroom sink vanity.Â And he even took the time to come back to the apartment to mount the TV properly when a handyman Iâd hired had an issue mounting it into a steel stud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a first-time renovator, Sweeten made the process pretty painless.Â My contractor takes great pride in his work, and as a client, I could not be happier with my experience working with him. Yes, there were delays (as there always are), but he was incredibly communicative and was able to handle my nerves and constant questions. He and his team are perfectionists and true craftsmen, and I could not be more pleased with their work. Everyone who comes to see the apartment sees the quality of how the tile is laid in the bathroom to how the floors are re-done, and I owe it all to my Sweeten contractor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1102 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>Since none of the finishes or fixtures in the apartment are worth saving and the layout is somewhat awkward, without a real kitchen or closet space, the best strategy is to gut the interior and begin with a clean slate</p>
<p>The apartment would benefit most from a more open layout, to bring light from the rear windows deeper into the interior.   In addition there are some practical considerations.  There&#8217;s the need for a real kitchen, with adequate counter space and storage. There&#8217;s the need for closet and storage space.  And it&#8217;s best to keep the kitchen and bathroom located where they are, close to the existing plumbing, gas and sewage lines.</p>
<p>The design can go in many different directions, depending on the owner&#8217;s lifestyle and priorities.  Here are some basic ideas:</p>
<p>FOR AN ENTREPENEUR</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1108 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone with her own business, or who sometimes works from home, this scheme builds an 8&#8242;-0&#8243; long work station along the right side of the apartment.  It has a continuous wood work counter, drawers and file cabinets below, and shelving on the wall above.  From here the owner can sit and work without distractions.  When she&#8217;s done, she can clear her things from the counter and the space stays tidy and well-organized, separate from rest of the apartment.</p>
<p>The entire apartment remains open.  At the back is the living and dining area.  At the middle is a bed and a clothing closet.  At the front, near the entry, are a galley kitchen, the bathroom, and linen and coat closets</p>
<p>FOR A FASHIONISTA</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1107 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone who cares deeply about fashion, this scheme has a walk in closet with plenty of room for her to keep her clothing and a place where she can get dressed in the morning.  The closet has racks for garments and shelving for shoes, bags and accessories.  There&#8217;s a window for natural light, and room for a chair and a vanity table or standing mirror too.</p>
<p>The remaining space in back becomes a sleeping alcove. The center of the apartment becomes a living area, with built in bookshelves and cabinets.  At the front, near the entry, are a galley kitchen, the bathroom, and linen and coat closets</p>
<p>FOR A GOURMET</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1109 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone who likes to  cook and entertain, this scheme has a full-size kitchen and a formal dining room.  The double galley kitchen provides plenty of counter and storage space, and room for two or three people to be cooking and prepping at one time.  The dining room is large enough to seat six or eight people.</p>
<p>The back becomes a living area with a fold-out bed.  At the front, near the entry, are the bathroom, a clothes closet and a linen closet.</p>
<p>Any of these layouts could be converted to a proper one-bedroom  by closing off the sleeping area.  This is something that&#8217;s possible but that I would try to work around.  Closing off a bedroom might make the rooms, especially those near the entrance, feel small and dark.</p>
<p>This apartment has a footprint that lends itself to many different layouts.  I&#8217;m very excited to see what choices the owner will make as she sweetens the space!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Here&#8217;s a space that needs some sweetening.</h3>
<p>This one bedroom prewar apartment is on Clinton Avenue in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The building is located brilliantly, on a lovely residential block close to the subway station, shops and restaurants.  The apartment is on the second floor and faces a quiet rear courtyard, with three large windows that let in lots of light.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1092 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has been unoccupied for many years and looks as if it hasn&#8217;t been remodeled in about forty years.  It has its original wood floors, crown and base moldings, and window trim, although they&#8217;re in poor condition.  The building has masonry walls and a hot water heating system with cast iron radiators.  The original wood windows have been replaced with insulated aluminum windows.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1093 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>

<p>The bathroom is roomy but has an awkward layout. The fixtures, wall tile, and floor tile all need to be replaced, and there&#8217;s a gaping hole in the ceiling.</p>

<p>The apartment has no real kitchen, just a freestanding stove and sink near the entry.  The plastic laminate cabinets are in bad shape and there are no counters.  The refrigerator is currently in the living room.</p>

<p>It would be easy to look at this apartment and turn away.  The floors, walls and ceilings all need to be repaired and refinished.  It has no closets or built in cabinets.  The small side windows look out onto  light wells.</p>
<p>But a closer look at the plan reveals that it&#8217;s actually quite wide, 14 feet, which allows for some flexibility in the layout.  It would be possible to reconfigure the kitchen and bathroom so that they&#8217;re more accommodating and more functional.  The windows at the rear of the apartment are quite large.  They bring in a lot of light and overlook a quiet space.  The entire layout could be opened up to bring more light from the back windows into the center of the apartment.</p>
<p>This apartment is in a great location and has a generous footprint.  It would benefit a great deal from just a little bit of sweetening!</p>
