										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">A developer&#8217;s dark style is transformed by its new owner with high-gloss cabinets, drawers turned sideways, and a comfy window seat</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24340 mb-0 size-chrono" title="window seat" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-Portrait-723x1085.jpg" alt="window seat" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</b></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redesign a kitchen</a> with a bright sheen in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: There was much to love about the two-bedroom condo in Bed-Stuy that Ursula, a math teacher, recently purchased. The developer, who had just converted a brownstone into four apartments, did a good job. However, the brand new kitchen just wasn’t her style. The dark mahogany cabinets and kitchen island weighed it down as did the floorboards of a similar color. The cabinets above the range also gave the space a claustrophobic feel. “The developer seemed to have an imagination when it came to painting. The walls were blue and yellow and very specific to his taste,” said Ursula.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>After</b></span>: Since her new apartment only has windows on the front and back, Ursula used <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, <span class="s1">a free service matching homeowners with general contractors to </span>tap her Sweeten contractor and harness that light. So out went the dark cabinets. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wood floors</a> were stripped and restained. To open up the kitchen, the cabinets and microwave above the range were out, too (“it just isn’t a pretty appliance,” said Ursula, speaking of microwaves). In their place is now a sleek <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hood</a>. With the space more open, the hexagonal tiles chosen for the backsplash became a focal point. “I think it must be the math teacher in me, but there is just something about them that I love,” she said. A &#8220;dresser&#8221;-style <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island</a> features three drawers for silverware, cutlery, dishes, and some pots and pans. &#8220;My beech cutting board is always on top of the kitchen island for food prep,&#8221; says Ursula. &#8220;It is conveniently in front of the oven, so I just have to turn around to cook.&#8221; The storage unit&#8217;s glossy gray tone offers contrast to the mostly white space. Her Sweeten contractor also utilized every inch of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinet space</a> including a stubborn area next to the oven. There, a drawer installed on its side—a cabinet wouldn&#8217;t fit—became a convenient <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pull-out spice rack</a>. As for the microwave, a much smaller one is hidden in the upper cabinets.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: Ursula&#8217;s Sweeten contractor used the same kitchen cabinet system from Ikea to create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bench seat</a> near the window. Now, there’s more storage space and extra seating for when guests come over. “That&#8217;s one of my favorite areas in the apartment because it is a little unexpected,” she says. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">A house taps into a modern vibe with a pot-filler, farmhouse sink and appliance garage</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23868 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Romuald had a dream: he wanted to live in a loft apartment. His current home, a 1,800-square-foot house in Elmhurst, was definitely <em>not</em> a loft, but it was ideal for him and his wife in many other ways. It was close to both of their jobs, as well as to both sets of parents, and they loved having a backyard right off the kitchen. So they decided to do the next best thing: make their home as &#8220;loft-like&#8221; as a house could be, most notably opening </span><span class="s1">up walls so the space would have an airy feel. Finally, it came time to tackle the tight, closed-off kitchen. Here are the details on a long-awaited kitchen renovation (and a few extras!) befitting two avid cooks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23870 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-Before-01-723x482.jpg" alt="loft apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23862 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="loft apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23860 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-01" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23865" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-09-10" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">After living in his home for close to ten years, Romuald knew that a new kitchen could dramatically change how his family used the space. He and his wife love cooking together, so they wanted to create a new kitchen in which two (or more!) people could comfortably work. Upon his wife&#8217;s recommendation, he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">turned to Sweeten</span></a> for help and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his <span class="s2">contractor</span></a> for the project. The original kitchen featured dark wood cabinets and felt cave-like because of a wall separating it from the main living space. Wanting to demolish the wall, it was necessary to regain the storage space by adding an island. It also afforded an extra work surface and an unobstructed sightline across the whole first floor of the house for a loft apartment feel. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Working with their contractor, the couple came up with a plan for their new kitchen. The original flooring was a tile that contrasted with the hardwood running through the rest of the first floor. They wanted to continue the wood look but opted for a gray “wood” porcelain that would be much easier to maintain (important for a kitchen that sees a lot of action!). <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semi-custom cabinets</a> made it possible for creative storage solutions like an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221; (details below) to be incorporated into the kitchen plan. The warm gray cabinets they chose from <a href="https://www.waypointlivingspaces.com/cabinets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Waypoint</span></a> coordinated with the new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a>. A white quartz countertop and classic marble subway tile for the backsplash brought a clean yet contrasting look. Above the stove, they installed a pot-filler to save the job of hauling a heavy pot of water from the sink on the island to the stovetop.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-11-12.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23866 mb-0 size-chrono" title="microwave" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-11-12.gif" alt="microwave" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Romuald and his wife started shopping around to replace all of their appliances with the exception of their investment appliance—a <a href="https://www.thermador.com/us/products/ranges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Thermador</span></a> range with blue knobs. After visiting appliance stores and making product choices,  he came across one of his favorite finds—the microwave drawer! A built-in microwave was placed high on their wish list so that it wouldn’t take up valuable counter space like their previous one did. When he came across the drawer, he knew that it was the way to go. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Next, their Sweeten contractor suggested the genius solution of an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221;—a much-loved-but-seldom-seen feature in city apartments. This storage unit would house their toaster, coffeemaker, as well as a few odds and ends, with outlets built into the back keeping a tangle of cords contained. With the “garage door” lowered, the counters would look instantly cleaner.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">In the spot where a dividing wall originally stood, they installed an island. While they had intended to build one about six feet long, it ultimately expanded to a 10-foot-long island—a decision that Romuald doesn’t regret one bit. “We can fit four stools along one side, while the other side has enough space for our farmhouse sink, microwave drawer, and dishwasher—and with storage room, too!” Given the space now has the open feel of a loft apartment, they can now watch the TV in their living room from the kitchen. Romuald explains, “We have it on a swivel, so we just swing it around and can cook and watch TV at the same time. This is great for unwinding after a long day’s work.” They also love the way that the breeze flows through the entire space when they open the door to the backyard—something that wasn’t possible with walls in the way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23861 mb-24 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">While the project took a bit longer than anticipated due to delays in delivery of materials, Romuald reports that they are very happy with the way it all turned out. And although they had intended on just renovating the kitchen, the project expanded in the end to include new floors throughout the entire living space, as well as a new railing for the stairs leading to the second floor of their house. All of these changes have made their house a dream home for the couple!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you, Romuald for sharing your new, loft-like space with us!</i></span></p>

Nikki and Chris&#8217; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen renovation</a> in Astoria, Queens</p>
<p>If you’ve ever had all four burners on and the oven cranking in a kitchen with average airflow, you know why ventilation is important. There’s the immediate issue of smoke, grease, and heat that can prompt your dinner guests to poke their heads out of the nearest open window and your smoke detector to pierce your eardrums. And then there’s the following day hangover, meaning the stale smell of last night’s meal camping out in every corner of your home.</p>
<p>Thoughtful ventilation in a kitchen can reduce, if not eliminate, this altogether. And the good news is it can be an easy addition to your renovation project.</p>
<p>It’s best to conceive your ventilation plan in the design phase of your kitchen renovation, because each decision will have an impact on other elements of your kitchen. Your choice of range will dictate the exhaust hood you will need to suck up grease and odor. Your hood might determine whether or not you can skip the ducting to funnel air outside.</p>
<h3><strong>Popular types of kitchen ventilation </strong></h3>
<p>Here are four types of kitchen ventilation ranging from the least involved, in terms of your renovation build out, to the most involved (and also the most effective):</p>
<h4><strong>Downdraft Kitchen Ventilation</strong></h4>
<p>If an exhaust hood doesn&#8217;t fit in your kitchen design, then there&#8217;s downdraft ventilation, which is a built-in feature of some ranges. They can either be stationary behind the range or pop up when you are cooking. This system pulls air horizontally into its filtering system. The air either goes back into the kitchen or, if there is ducting, taken outside of the home. If no ducting is involved, then downdraft ventilation is an option for apartments and townhouses where air cannot be directed outside.</p>
<h4><strong>Ductless Exhaust Hood Ventilation </strong></h4>
<p>The restraints of your home and your budget, as well as your choice of cooking range, are the biggest factors dictating your ventilation. A hood with no ducting or piping to the outside will filter out some of the grease and odor in the air, but ultimately that air will be recirculated into the room, explained Jace Kieffer from <a href="https://www.kieffers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kieffer’s Appliances</a>, a leading showroom based in Philadelphia. If you’re doing a lot of cooking, cracking a window might seem basic, but it will help, he said.</p>
<p>Apartment and townhouse owners may not have the option of funneling cooking odors outside. If that is the case, then downgrading the size of your range to limit smoke and odor might be a wise idea.</p>
<p>The cost of a hood with no additional ventilation is a few hundred dollars from a big-box store like Home Depot. Although construction costs, especially labor, can differ across the country, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Jon</a> estimated installation of a ductless hood to cost $150. For New York City, installing a smaller hood against a wall starts at $250, said Scott Kopin from design showroom <a href="https://www.pirch.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pirch</a>. Larger hoods and those installed over kitchen islands are more complex adding to the installation costs. You’re looking at a starting price of about $500 for this, Kopin said.</p>
<h4><strong>Ducted Exhaust Hood Ventilation</strong></h4>
<p>A hood with piping that takes cooking air and odor outside will be sufficient for most families who like to cook, according to Sweeten contractor Jon. For big meals, it might be worth opening a window so the old air is pushed out as fresh air comes in. On top of buying a hood (that can go from a few hundred dollars to several thousand for a custom job), the cost of installing ducting and cutting an exit into the wall of your kitchen is “not as bad as you might think,” said Jon. To cut through vinyl or wood siding (something like stone is more difficult and expensive) and install about 10 feet of piping is about $400 to $800, according to Jeffrey Payne, sales associate from Atlanta-based appliance showroom <a href="https://www.howardpayne.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howard Payne Company</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Kitchen Ventilation System: Makeup Air</strong></h4>
<p>Unlike a typical HVAC system, makeup air is an open system that brings fresh air in as stale air is pushed out. It is activated only when needed, like when you switch your hood fan on.</p>
<p>A makeup air system could also be required. Since 2009, the International Residential Code, the code followed by most US states, requires a makeup air system for any hood that is 400 CFM or greater (Cubic Feet per Minute is a measure of air volume). Building inspectors previously took a relaxed approach to this clause; that has changed since houses became more airtight, according to Jace. It is becoming more common for the 400 CFM rule to be enforced. If your home, such as an apartment or townhouse, doesn’t allow for outside ventilation, including a makeup air system, then your hood may need to register less than 400 CFM.</p>
<p>With the makeup air system, not only do you get a fresh air, you can also get fresh air that matches the internal temperature of your home. That’s because the incoming air is warmed or cooled in the HVAC system before it is circulated in your home.</p>
<p>Makeup air is the most sophisticated&#8211;and also the most expensive. The piece that controls the inflow of air is a few hundred dollars, said Sweeten contractor Jon. Installing it, running the piping and cutting a hole in the siding for the air to exit starts at about $1,000.</p>
<p>Kitchen Ventilation</p>
<p>Like anything in home renovations, there are many variables&#8211;budget, layout, your priorities, etc.&#8211;that will determine your end result. Whatever your ventilation desires, make sure you decide what you want early in your renovation to avoid some later headaches.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the size of their kitchen, most homeowners feel it could be larger. But what if your kitchen is </span><span class="s1"><i> really </i></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">small? Depending on the room’s dimensions—a narrow galley kitchen or even a trim 12- by 12-foot box shape—appliances in particular can seem to overwhelm a space and throw everything out of proportion. Thankfully, manufacturers have responded to this dilemma with smaller-size appliances that still offer the function you want while not overwhelming the space. What’s more, you may find the smaller kitchen, with most everything in arm’s reach, is actually more efficient and thus a happier, more productive place to cook. And with so many major manufacturers on this bandwagon, you don’t have to sacrifice style, either. P.S.: If you have a large kitchen, this is good news, too, providing the opportunity to fit an additional cook surface or fridge, or turn a walk-in pantry into an additional prep space. Read on:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layout in a triangle</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For any kitchen to work well, the layout must be planned for top efficiency. In a small cookspace, appliances in close proximity mean fewer steps and better conservation of movement and energy. Follow the classic kitchen triangle: place the functions of cooking, cooling and washing—stove, fridge, and sink—so that if you draw a line from each one to the other, you create a triangle. This means you will have allowed some landing space next to each of these features, and separation, too, to avoid a collision if two people share the kitchen. Once your floor plan is a go, you can choose the appliances that will do the job you want—and also fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cooking with mini power</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have your heart set on a range, more than a few manufacturers will accommodate you with a compact 24-inch model that allows four burners and an oven, too, of course. <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueStar</a> makes a range in an industrial style that isn’t the size of an SVU but still packs loads of cooking power. If you’re comfortable with classic style, look for a vintage 21-inch O’Keefe and Merritt, a model created when small kitchens were the only way to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Need to go smaller still? You can find two-burner radiant and induction cooktops from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.kitchenaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KitchenAid</a> or <a href="https://www.geappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE</a> in widths starting at 15 inches. Then place the oven on the wall to free up more undercounter space for a slim dishwasher (more on this below). Also check out combo ovens that offer microwave as well as convection (one less appliance!), available from most manufacturers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t overlook range hoods; these come smaller, too, to top off their cooking cousins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21380 mb-10 size-chrono" title="small space appliances" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08-723x1085.gif" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
<span class="img-label"> (Above) An undercounter refrigerator (left of the sink) and 24&#8243; range in Emily&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upper West Side renovation</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Compact cooling </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Refrigeration of smaller stature has come a long way since the top-mount model in your starter apartment. Manufacturers such as <a href="https://www.vikingrange.com/consumer/category/products/refrigeration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking</a> make a model as slim as 30 inches, which can still stow a tray of appetizers. Need to go slimmer still? <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a>, LG, and GE each offer a stainless-steel bottom freezer refrigerator that measures 24 inches wide. If you don’t tend to stock a lot for daily meals, a refrigerator drawer (or two) is an alternative, and can be found from Thermador, <a href="https://www.monogram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE Monogram</a>, or Electrolux for as small as 24 inches wide by 34 ¼ inches high. Plus, the elimination of another swinging door helps reduce the feeling of clutter, easing traffic jams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undercounter fridges that still have a door are also available from companies such as KitchenAid, Frigidaire, Kenmore, and <a href="https://www.whirlpool.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whirlpool</a>. You can get a nice long run of counterspace if you keep all your appliances under the counter, which will make the overall space look less cluttered and hence feel larger.</span></p>
<p><strong>Washing in small batches</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The standard dishwasher comes 24 inches wide, and that will fit in most galley kitchens. But if you wish to go smaller, Frigidaire, Bosch, and Kenmore make models as narrow as 18 inches—just what you need to handle a day’s dishes. Or consider a dishwasher drawer like those from <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel</a>. Typically available at 24 inches wide, these versions can handle dishware for a party of six, but if that’s not how you dine every day, then it’s not a major issue anyway.</p>
