										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Grow your contracting business by following these easy steps on Facebook and Instagram</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44674" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having social media business pages enables business owners like yourself to easily grow your contracting business. These accounts will help you to establish a custom online presence in communities where your past and potential clients already spend their time. Whether you have already created pages or you are looking to start from scratch, business pages allow your audience to easily find your company, increasing the credibility of your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, </span><span class="s1">a service that connects qualified <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/signup/expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractors, builders, and remodelers</a> with homeowners and design professionals with renovation projects, offers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this guide to help you establish an online presence. When speaking with clients, frequently referenced sites include Facebook and Instagram. Pulling together cohesive messaging and showcasing past projects on these platforms can help give your firm a leg up. Ready to grow your business’s presence on social media? </span></p>
<h3><strong>Facebook Updates to Grow Your Contracting Business</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Establish your profile</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before creating a Facebook business page, you must establish an individual profile on Facebook if you do not have one already. You can use an existing individual profile to create a page for your contracting business or start a new individual profile specifically for the purposes of setting up your company page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that there is some overlap in login information between company pages and individual profiles, so if you want team members to have access, it may make sense to start an individual account that is solely for business purposes. </span></p>
<p><strong>Create your business page (or clean it up!)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve established an individual profile, “Create a Page” for your business. Upload a Profile Picture and Cover Photo &#8212; pages with cover photos typically get more page likes and visits! Choose photos that showcase your work and that you’d be proud to have potential clients see. This is where you want to show your best work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you already have a profile, take some time to remove any content or posts that don’t support or strengthen your business profile. A good gut check is to ask yourself, would I show this photo to potential clients? If the answer is no, take it off your business page.</span></p>
<p><strong>Describe your services</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Description: Write a brief description that will appear in the search results. This is where you can let people know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">why </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">they should engage with your business and what neighborhoods you operate in. What are your specialties and in-house capabilities? How will you help clients achieve their goals? Evaluate this description once a year and consider using it across your online profiles including in your Sweeten company description! </span></p>
<p><strong>Use quality pictures that showcase past work</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should choose 3 or 4 projects (like you did to join Sweeten!) that showcase your strengths and the beautiful work that your company does to get your business page started. In general, post valuable content that will resonate with your audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have an awesome project underway? Post photos of in-progress projects or completed projects so your audience can get a taste of your work experience. Pick a few photos and write up a few sentences to describe the scope of work that you accomplished for each project. Again use that gut check, if you wouldn’t show the photo to potential clients &#8212; don’t upload it to your page.</span></p>
<p><strong>Promote your page</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You now have a Facebook business page that will give potential clients a feel for your firm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When people like your page, it&#8217;s easier for others to discover it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Use your other channels like your website or Sweeten profile to promote your page. You can even connect it with your firm’s Instagram account so you can update both simultaneously. Linking the page can be one way of minimizing upkeep, but remember to check in on the account at least every 6 months to make updates and add new photos of recent work.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Instagram</strong><strong> Updates to Grow Your Contracting Business</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Establish your account </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the Instagram app as there are many features not available on the desktop version of their site. Pick a username or “handle” that represents your business. Try to use some combination of your company name or initials and keywords for the industry (think “home,” “remodeling,” “GC,” “contractor,” etc.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you just signed up or already have a handle, switch the account to “professional” and review the privacy settings to set your account as public so potential clients can easily find your account. </span></p>
<p><strong>Define your business and a company bio</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add your company name so clients can identify or search for your firm. Write a brief company bio and try to stick to the 150 character limit. Include where you are based, and highlight your firm’s strengths, goals or accolades. </span></p>
<p><strong>Fill up the grid</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick at least nine photos that you are the proudest of to get your profile off the ground. Once you’ve filled up the initial grid, you’ll have a great base to build off of. If you already have an account, consider deleting any posts that don’t support the services you are trying to convey.</span></p>
<p><strong>Provide captions for your photos</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write a short caption for each posted photo to let clients know why that photo is significant. Don’t be afraid to use hashtags in the caption or tag other accounts in the photo. Engaging with other accounts through hashtags, tags, and comments can help others find and follow your account. You can also add geotags so potential clients can see the general location of any projects that you post. These features can be edited or updated at any time, so they’re ideal you’re looking to refresh old posts with photos.</span></p>
<p><strong>Follow others in your industry</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sweeten_home/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@sweeten_home on Instagram</a> and then follow any industry contacts that you might have, including designers, architects, subcontractors, or showrooms. Not only will this help you stay current on industry news or events, but it will also inform your explore page, which Instagram generates to help you find new accounts. </span></p>
<p>Follow these steps to enhance your social media business profiles and you&#8217;ll make great progress to grow your contracting business online.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Mastering the renovation sales process: How to create trust with a client and deal with unresponsiveness</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47748 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ContractorsGuide.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ContractorsGuide.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ContractorsGuide-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ContractorsGuide-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The process of signing a new client contains multiple steps. In addition to finding the client, you, as the contractor, have to find out the client&#8217;s budget, the scope that they want to accomplish, and when they want to start the project. Knowing these details will help determine if your firm and the client are a good fit. After that comes client meetings, estimates, and the closing. Sweeten has put together this renovation sales process guide that covers each of these phases.</p>
<p>Luckily, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> prequalifies clients for contractors, which is often the most difficult step. Sweeten’s process puts homeowners with projects in touch with the right contractor. So, when you come on board, the process of identifying possible clients is already done for you.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches <a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractors</a> with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness, and appropriate budget. Additionally, contractors pay only when they win a project. Sweeten project budgets start at $15,000 and average over $100,000.</span></p>
<h3>What to do at client meetings</h3>
<p>There are many different ways to continue the sales process. Many contractors set up a meeting with the client. At the meeting, they go over the details of the project. <strong>Many contractors find these items useful to bring up at the first meeting:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The scope of the project</li>
<li>The reason for the renovation</li>
<li>The client&#8217;s timeline for the project</li>
<li>The budget</li>
<li>Reasons your firm is a good match for the project</li>
</ul>
<p>The meeting is a discussion that gives you a chance to engage with and draw out the client. Whether you meet in person initially or you have a quick call to see if you are on the same page, it is important that you be direct with the client regarding their desired timeline for the job. This will help you figure out if the client is serious or just exploring options. It will also help you develop a strategy for following up with the client.</p>
<p>Use this opportunity to show you are their partner in the project. Most homeowners respond well to positive remarks from the contractor. If they want to start in six weeks, tell them what needs to be done to meet that date, or get close to it. Your positive attitude can give the client confidence in you. And it can help move the project along.</p>
<h3>Preparing the estimate</h3>
<p>Homeowners will expect a project estimate from you sooner rather than later. In fact, homeowners expect the estimate within a week or so. By telling the homeowners when they should expect the estimate, you can manage their expectations and set up a clear next checkpoint.</p>
<p>Most homeowners have questions about the estimates they receive. Many successful contractors like to set up a phone or in-person meeting to go over the estimate. Proposing a meeting for a week or two after supplying the estimate should give the homeowners time to go over it on their own. Besides answering questions, this meeting gives you a chance to reconfirm the timeline and the budget. Plus, it&#8217;s an opportunity for more client contact (which is always a good thing!)</p>
<p>Getting the estimate to the client quickly gives time for revisions. This is especially important for clients who expect a quick start to the project.</p>
<h3>Clients who won&#8217;t commit</h3>
<p>Everyone has experienced clients who drag their feet once they have the estimate. This is where your earlier conversations with the client can pay off. Knowing their timeline allows you to show your expertise and help move the process along. One way to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remind them that to meet their deadline, items need to be ordered now or in the near future.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some clients will stop communicating with the contractor completely. It&#8217;s frustrating! But if you have done your job up to this point, there is nothing wrong with asking point-blank questions. For example, you can ask:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8220;Do you want to continue with the project?&#8221; </strong></li>
<li><strong>&#8220;Are you still considering my firm?&#8221;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“Yes” answers to those questions will move the project along. No one wants to hear a no, but at least a “no” answer means you can stop wasting your time and focus on other projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>To help with difficult clients, Sweeten has a team that keeps in contact with the clients. They can help you get answers to those questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The payoff to the steps above is to get the client to commit, so you can finally start the renovation process.</p>
