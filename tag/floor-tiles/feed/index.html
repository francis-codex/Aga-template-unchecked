										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><em>When Amanda and her husband set out to upgrade from their two-bedroom Windsor Terrace apartment in Brooklyn, they had a few adjectives in mind—light, airy, warm. They loved the neighborhood as well as the great light in their rental, but as work-from-home writers, desired larger bedrooms and a more spacious kitchen. They had also just gotten married, and if you’ve ever had a registry, you understand why they needed more kitchen storage! Here’s the story of how a visit with friends led them to a new home, and how an irresistible pattern sparked their kitchen design.</em></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22363 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-723x565.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="565" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-723x565.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-300x235.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-600x469.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Amanda’s initial intention was to stay in Windsor Terrace, the direction of her apartment search changed when she and her husband visited some friends at their new home in the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a> (CHC). They loved the feel of the complex and the apartment space itself, and realized that this was where they wanted to be. After a few months of checking out CHC listings as they came on the market, the couple landed a two-bedroom, one-bath apartment. Coincidentally, it was the mirror image of the one their friends owned!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As writers who both work from home, Amanda and her husband appreciated that the two bedrooms were equally sized; one could be used as a roomy home office as well as guest quarters for out-of-town visitors.  At around 1,000 square feet, the unit also had southern exposures that provided the lovely, warm light they had been in search of. The only issue was the kitchen: it was dark and closed off, and connected to a strange pass-through pantry that housed a bar counter. Although it had been recently renovated, the craftsmanship was poor, as there were already cracks and scratches in the cabinetry and flooring. At first sight, Amanda thought it would be a deal-breaker. She was eager for a simple move, and very hesitant to embark on a renovation of any kind. But slowly, she and her husband talked themselves into it—after all, the apartment was ideal in every other way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22336 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-Before-02" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So as they began the process of closing on the apartment, Amanda <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their kitchen renovation</a> to Sweeten. As a first-time renovator, she wasn’t sure how to decide between the various bids. Our in-house team came to the rescue: a call with one of Sweeten’s project advisors proved to be useful. The chat gave Amanda the chance to think out loud and consider the pros and cons of each bid, and she selected her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/338020 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22338 mb-24 mt-24 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-01" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22340 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amanda’s vision for the kitchen reflected the feeling she wanted for the apartment as a whole: clean and bright, but not too modern or sterile. “We both love to cook and wanted to feel comfortable there, like we could make a mess,” Amanda explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They began by knocking down the walls that separated the kitchen and pantry from the living room and dining nook. (This is a common theme in the CHC kitchens! For more inspiration, check out Laura and Matthew’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a>, as well as Mario and Joe’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>.) One of the doorways from the kitchen to the hallway was closed off to extend the kitchen space across the entire wall. In a brilliant move, their Sweeten contractor turned the unused space next to the refrigerator into diagonal built-in shelving, now the perfect spot to display photos and items from their travels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the space was opened up, the couple turned their attention to the details. Early on, Amanda fell in love with a Mediterranean-inspired patterned tile in black, grey and white, and built the entire kitchen design to complement it. Although she had originally considered the tile as a backsplash, it made more sense as flooring—a wise suggestion from her mom. For the millwork, their Sweeten contractor sourced custom cabinetry with simple lines in a white shaker style. A single set of glass doors was installed to break the solid run of uppers. A rich walnut countertop was chosen for an added layer of drama—they had first considered using a lighter wood, but the darker wood coordinated better with the floors, a decision supported by their contractor. Although <span style="color: #000000;">the work surface requires</span> some upkeep, Amanda reports that she “adores them!” Brass knobs and pulls for the cabinets were next, along with a vintage-inspired metal light fixture for the ceiling. While they kept their fairly new appliances from the apartment’s previous renovation, they added a wine fridge next to the dishwasher.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22342 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22341 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-05-06.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-05-06" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, Amanda worked with her Sweeten contractor to resolve issues as they arose. In one incident, the cabinetmaker realized that the measurements had been off, and that a cabinet would have been essentially unusable because of an immovable obstruction. He worked with the contractor to revise the layout overnight, and went into production with very little delay. Aside from this challenge, things went mostly according to plan, not to mention the shortest wait time for board approval that we’ve ever heard—about two weeks! (Could it be because Sweeten has done dozens of renovations in her building?)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that they’re done, Amanda has words of wisdom for aspiring renovators: “Don’t rush the process. We were impatient and moved all our things in right after the demolition stage. This meant that all of our belongings went into one bedroom, stacked and wrapped in plastic. We went to stay with our in-laws for the duration of the project. Our contractor was very understanding and worked quickly, but didn’t cut corners and finished on schedule—it took about a month in the end. Although this didn’t happen with us, a hurried contractor might be tempted to be less detailed-oriented. Trust the contractor! He knows what he’s doing and how long it’ll take to do it.”</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22339 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-02" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a book lover, Amanda’s one regret is that they didn’t think to carve out space in the wall shared between the kitchen and the hallway for built-in bookshelves. Still, as a first-time renovator, we think she did an amazing job, and like other Sweeten clients, she can always return for another renovation someday!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thank you, Amanda, for sharing this lovely space. We hope that you and your husband enjoy cooking up your next literary masterpieces.</em></p>

<span class="img-label">Guest post by Lisa, Upper East Side homeowner</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last year, after renting in the Village for 20 years, I bought a small one-bedroom on the Upper East Side. The apartment is on a high floor, bright and sunny, and except for the kitchen, in perfect condition. The teeny tiny kitchen was dated and shabby with sagging cabinets, cracked tile, bulky appliances, and a huge mystery stain on the ugly laminate countertop<span id="more-14621"></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because I had no experience planning a renovation, I decided to live with the kitchen and figure out exactly what worked and what didn’t. As soon as I unpacked, one problem became apparent… the builder-grade cabinets were too shallow for serving dishes and cookware and I had to store my pots and pans in my coat closet. The lower drawers and cabinets were so narrow they were almost useless. The kitchen sink was far too shallow and there was limited counter space with only one electrical outlet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14626" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-05" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-05-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-05-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14624" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-03" width="600" height="803" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-03-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With these issues in mind, I started my research.  My dream kitchen had beautiful wooden cabinetry with sleek appliances and marble counters, but as I evaluated the actual space I had to work with (and my budget), I decided that a clean minimal style would work best in the boxy little space. Once I figured out what I was looking for, I started canvassing my friends for contractor recommendations. The horror stories scared me enough to postpone my plans for a month or so, until one by one, my appliances started dying. The stove burners led the way, followed in rapid succession by the microwave and dishwasher. When the refrigerator started making a grinding noise, I knew I couldn’t procrastinate any longer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fortunately, I read about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> on Apartment Therapy and it sounded like exactly what I needed. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I posted my project</a> and quickly got an email from Sweeten helping me determine that because I knew pretty much what I was looking for and wasn’t making drastic structural changes, I could reasonably go with a good contractor and forgo hiring (and paying for) a designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I got in touch with four contractors referred by Sweeten and ultimately selected <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Erion</a>. He wasn’t discouraged by the size of the kitchen, understood what I was looking for, had great taste, and showed an eye for details. As a newbie, I also really appreciated that he was very clear about costs, estimating to me what materials and labor were expected to cost for each item instead of just giving me a lump price.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14627" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14632" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-06" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-06-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14629" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I sent Erion photos of minimalist-style kitchens I liked and gave him my list of complaints about the current kitchen. From that point on, he took over. He handled everything. He recommended that we go with semi-custom cabinets in order to get the depth I wanted, and showed me samples for countertops and hardware, first editing options down to two or three initial choices, with more available if necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on Erion’s samples, I went with white high-gloss upper cabinets and gray high-gloss lower cabinets with bar pull hardware. The countertop is <a href="https://www.daltile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daltile’s One Quartz</a> in Luminesce, which is a bright white that went nicely with the cabinets and backsplash and needs almost no upkeep. For the backsplash, I went with <a href="https://www.marazziusa.com/our-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marazzi Sistem C</a> Bianco, similar to subway tile but with an interesting size. In order to add a little visual interest, we used three rows of Daltile Fashion Accents in nickel blend. The floor is tiled in Marazzi Soho Anthracite because, well, just because I love the look of a slate floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to maximize the little space I have, I chose a <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/products/dishwashers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch 18-inch dishwasher</a> and a <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel 25-inch counter-depth refrigerator</a>. The range and microwave are both <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a>, chosen mostly for the sleek lines and reliable reputation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The end result is both beautiful and functional, and was on time and on budget!</p>
