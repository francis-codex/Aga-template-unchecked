										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>After spending many years patching up a rental they lived in together, two architects decided to purchase their very own fixer-upper on the top floor of an 1890s brownstone on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. One may wonder whether Kate Meagher and Arthur Liu had the same basic questions as non-design pros when it came to budget calculations, the cost of relocating plumbing, or even where to find a contractor, and the answer is yes! Having fallen in love with the view of the Hudson River, high ceilings, and the fact that the apartment hadn’t been touched since the ‘60s, they embraced the cozy new home to make &lt;500-square-foot feel significantly bigger. The couple came to Sweeten to find a team to help them reconfigure walls, add space to the kitchen, and renovate the bath. Here, Kate and Arthur tell us about their renovation journey, including a painting project that took longer than anticipated—but the results were well worth it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21477" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-723x506.jpg" alt="unnamed" width="723" height="506" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-723x506.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-300x210.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-600x420.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-21420"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by Upper West Side homeowner Kate Meagher </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Arthur and I had been living in an apartment for around seven years, which belonged to his family. That apartment—much loved—was a constant work in progress. We improved the kitchen and bathroom, installed new lighting, and suffered through two floods (thanks, upstairs neighbors!) which required new ceilings and flooring yet again. As architects, we loved it—it was great to have a rental which we could experiment on. At a certain point, however, it seemed that we should be directing our energy toward a place that was truly ours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During our search, Arthur and I had gotten into a rhythm. After each Sunday’s open house tour, we’d stop in whichever neighborhood we ended up in, get a drink, and sketch floor plans over the broker’s listing sheets. Could we fit a dishwasher? How did the closet compare with our old one? How much would it cost if the plumbing needed to be reconfigured? (Sweeten’s construction and renovation <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guides</a> were extremely helpful setting initial <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/renovation-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a> targets.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were obviously looking for a fixer-upper, and when we saw this apartment, we fell in love despite its tiny size. It’s right next to Riverside Park, on the top floor of a beautiful brownstone. The ceilings are high and the bay windows still have the original curved glass. In the winter, when the leaves are off the trees, we can see the Hudson. Best yet, outside of some electrical updates, the apartment hadn’t been touched since the 1960s. The main priorities for this apartment were to update and expand the kitchen, renovate the bathroom, and to squeeze as much storage space in without impacting the small footprint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had come across Sweeten at some point in our apartment search, and it was the first place we looked for a general contractor after we closed. Arthur and I both work on very large ground-up projects and don’t regularly work with contractors on the scale of a New York apartment renovation—we needed help finding someone! Sweeten definitely filled a niche for us, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we posted our project</a>. We interviewed several and chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>. I was struck by the notes he took throughout our initial walk-through, and that he asked for time to review further on his own. We felt he really listened and understood what we wanted and could accomplish it within our timeframe and budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21455 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Arthur_floor_plan-723x482.jpg" alt="Arthur_floor_plan" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21431 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-03" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21436 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21438 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-07" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21439" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-08" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love the classic detailing in the apartment and wanted to preserve everything we could that was more or less original. However, both our sensibilities skew contemporary/minimalist when designing, and we were looking to strike a balance. We decided to make only a few key alterations to the floorplan. First, the wall separating the kitchen/bath zone and the living room was moved, gaining us a little more than a foot-and-a-half extra. The bathroom feels more generous now, and most importantly, it allowed us to configure a narrow L-shape for the kitchen. We chose tall doors for them to align with the height of the bay windows, and drew a custom profile for the door frames—beautifully executed by our contractor’s team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The extra L-shaped length was critical to add a full-height refrigerator, full-height pantry cabinet, and an 18” dishwasher. We installed shallow 15-inch-deep cabinets in the new leg, and kept all appliances to the adjacent wall. This preserved as much floor space as possible, and had the added benefit of retaining the original locations for the plumbing, gas lines, and ducted extractor—no permits to file or added expense of rerouting. We wanted a minimal aesthetic—black and white. Ultimately, we took our cues from a soapstone countertop we saw on a Sweeten blog <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. After visiting M. Teixeira’s amazing warehouse, we chose a stone that had a lot of green undertones in the black base. For the cabinet paints, we decided on an extremely dark black-green shade, and a cool white to complement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This space ended up being a special project in the apartment. While our contractor&#8217;s team completed the major work—prepping the walls, installing wood flooring, adding lighting, installing the appliances and sink, and tiling the backsplash—Arthur and I ended up building the rest of the kitchen ourselves (!) using Ikea base cabinets that we modified and custom fronts. We also decided to just paint the fronts ourselves. (*Note: after doing it and coming out the other side, this is NOT recommended. However, if you have the time, patience and space, you will save a lot.) For those of you interested in the details: We needed to paint 26 panels—some over ten ft tall—inside the apartment because, well, that’s the only space we had. Working in stages, we brushed two coats per side, sanded, vacuumed and wiped down with a tack cloth between each coat. And our two cats meant even more obsessive vacuuming and confining them to the bedroom for most of the full month it took to paint—the threat of fur was everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21429 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-01" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21441 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-11" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21440" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-09-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedroom, our excellent foreman, Al, demolished a loft bed, and combined the small bedroom closet with an adjacent coat closet. We’ve hung a full-height curtain, so we can use every last inch of the ceiling height for storage. The entry door from the living room into the bedroom was moved toward the kitchen. Previously, it was right in the middle of a living room wall, making that room very difficult to furnish. The team expertly restored the plaster walls, and matched new wood flooring inside the closet area and kitchen with the original (our contractor really pulled through with that find!). New moldings were also seamlessly integrated in areas that had been exposed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21430 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-02" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21435 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21443 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-13" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21432" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom skews warmer in tone than the kitchen, and was designed as a spare and sleek space. We replaced the tub with a wet room—an open shower without curtains or doors—and rain shower head to keep the lines clean and open up the room. (This required an <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/business/laa.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAA permit</a>, which called for a master plumber.) A wing wall keeps all the water from splashing out, and conceals a recessed shelf for products. The contractor&#8217;s team—Al specifically—were truly master tilers. We chose a tiny copper ceramic mosaic for the floor, shower curb and base, and creamy white, elongated tile for the walls. The grout is a warm brown that picks up on the terracotta edges of the white tile and the copper tones of the floor tile. We, of course wanted every joint to match and it does. We opted for a large recessed mirrored medicine cabinet to contain clutter and a wall-mounted sink with no cabinet. Everything fits except the hairdryer, which lives in the credenza directly outside of the bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21442" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-12-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-12" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are so happy with how the project turned out. Maybe it’s the sweat equity, but it is always very satisfying to see your design realized. We couldn&#8217;t have done it without our Sweeten contractor, Al and the team. They were a pleasure to work with throughout and we’d love to collaborate again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thank you so much, Arthur and Kate, for sharing your story. It’s always intriguing to hear about a home renovation from the point of view of architects! We hope you enjoy your new home.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Renovating for resale in Brooklyn: a kitchen and bath remodel enjoyed by current &amp; future homeowners</h2>
<h2><i style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heather and Doug&#8217;s 1980s South Slope condo was in need of an update, but given the family’s eventual plans to move, they kept putting off a renovation. When DIY fixes (also known as “tape”) were no longer enough, it became clear that finally renovating for future resale was the way to go. The end result? A sunny, modern kitchen &amp; bath renovation that the family knows will bring resale value—and that they get to enjoy in the present. </span></i><i style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read on for Heather’s take on major changes in two key spaces.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h2>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Heather, South Park Slope homeowner</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My husband, Doug, and I moved into our small condo in South Park Slope shortly after our daughter was born six years ago. The building had been abandoned in the 1970s and then turned into eight small condo units in the 1980s. We love the community, the location, and many things about our space, but the kitchen and bathroom had clearly not been updated since the original condo conversion. With our son, Elijah, and daughter, Alice, now sharing a bedroom, we knew that we would eventually need one more room, so we didn’t see any reason to renovate. But then the cupboards and the appliances began to give out. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I work at a book publishing company and telecommute, so I spend a lot of time working at the kitchen table and dreamed about ripping out our old kitchen cupboards. After one too many times reapplying duct tape to the fridge shelves and silverware drawer, we decided to take the plunge and renovate.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I loved reading the Sweeten renovation blogs and seeing the amazing transformation of other people’s homes. We had some recommendations for contractors from friends, but weren’t sure about the fit. So we </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">p</a><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">osted our project</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten and started to talk to contractors. What led us to choose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was his experience in renovating for resale. We were able to see some units that he was renovating in progress, and he had great suggestions for things to focus on for a possible sale in the future (like a dual showerhead, </span>which is really great for families with kids).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided on a classic, mostly white approach for the kitchen. Our plan was to add color with paint only, which would be easier for the next owners to change. With no edits to the layout or plumbing, we focused on choosing the materials that would make the most sense. We decided on Shaker-style cupboards from Home Depot and classic white subway tile for the kitchen backsplash from Nemo tile. Our counters are Caesarstone (from Appia Marble), the fridge is Samsung (from Home Depot), and the range is a Viking (from AJ Madison).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best changes was a little one: Previously, the stove was directly next to the sink. We added space between the sink and stove—having a place to rest a pot or put dirty plates out of view from people in the living room is very nice.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bathroom, we continued with the same subway tile from the kitchen for the walls, but veered from the “classic” plan on the floor tile. I loved the blue tile from Nemo and the idea of having a bright color in a classic herringbone pattern. No one was sure about this when we opened the box of tiles, but it is now our (and Lem’s) favorite part of the bathroom renovation. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given our short time frame, we ended up having to make many decisions quickly. But this made some of our choices less overwhelming. Instead of having 2,000 tubs to choose from, we would look at what was in stock (only 800!). While we spent quite a bit of time at big box stores and online, we also became acquainted with a few very helpful local places in our neighborhood that we will certainly go to again. I would encourage others doing a renovation to try to get a schedule of when cupboards, appliances, etc. will be needed (if not dates, then at what point in the process) because once you are</span> into the project, there is very little time to make decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since our apartment was too small to live in with a renovation underway, we planned to move out for five weeks over the summer to accommodate the work. Everything went fairly smoothly, and Lem made sure that the apartment was ready for us to move back into on schedule. Given how small and close-knit our building is, I was very concerned about the renovation being disruptive for our neighbors. Lem took great care to cover the floor and other parts of the apartment so the noise wasn’t too much for our downstairs neighbors, and so that dust didn’t invade other parts of our apartment. All of the workers were respectful of our space, the building, and our neighbors, which meant a lot to us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few add-on items that we chose not to do because we didn&#8217;t want to spend more money. One was having all of the outlets changed to new, stainless steel ones with USB ports. I plan to do this myself but wonder when that is going to happen. It probably would have been worth it to go ahead. The other was to have our floors redone. It seemed like too much to manage at the time, but now that the kitchen and bath look so nice, I notice how other parts of the apartment look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We LOVE our renovated space. The kitchen not only looks better, but it is infinitely easier to use and we have more storage space. It is amazing to have a real size fridge. The bathroom is also much more functional and looks bright and clean (even when it is not totally). Our old appliances in both the kitchen and the bathroom were energy intensive, and it was important to me to get an energy-efficient fridge and a low-flow toilet. They are little things in the bigger picture, but make me feel a little bit better about our environmental footprint.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Here on the Sweeten blog, we aim to translate insight from NYC renovators and contractors into information you can use to make better decisions about improving your home. After a look at different styles and materials of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/ceramic-glass-or-stone-15-bathroom-wall-tile-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bathroom wall tiles</a>, we&#8217;re moving along to floor tile. While some tiles work on both the walls and the floors, floor tile has to provide grip to help with slippery post-tub steps. You can incorporate that grip by selecting floor tiles with varied texture or by choosing small shapes installed with grout seams. You can also play with the way that tiles are installed to create different patterns with identical materials. This week: we’ve rounded up ten dynamic and distinctive bathroom floor tiles from Sweeten renovation projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-gray-hexagon-floor-tiles"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14545" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/inspiration_floortiles.jpg" alt="white and gray hexagon floor tiles in a bathroom with double sink and white vanity after renovation" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/inspiration_floortiles.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/inspiration_floortiles-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Straight Lay Patterns</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Straight lay tiles are oriented in a straightforward grid with clean, simple lines. Monochromatic cubes and subway tiles tend to work best here &#8211; typically creating a more modern feel than the staggered alternative.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12636" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SWEETEN_UES-22.jpg" alt="mosaic house floor tiles" width="600" height="898" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SWEETEN_UES-22.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SWEETEN_UES-22-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/three-modern-baths-two-custom-built-ins-one-sweetened-upper-east-side-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Lauren and Adam in the Upper East Side</a> chose glazed deep cobalt blue terracotta floor tiles from <a href="https://www.mosaichse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mosaic House</a> to add variety and character to this contemporary all-white bath.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14240" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01.jpg" alt="ann sacks porcelain floor tiles" width="600" height="884" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01-204x300.jpg 204w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The shower floor of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mario and Joe&#8217;s bathroom in Clinton Hill</a> minimizes slip with striated gray porcelain floor tiles from <a href="https://www.annsacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ann Sacks</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Pinwheel Basket-Weave Patterns</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pinwheel basket-weave patterns are created with four rectangular tiles set in the shape of a square with one smaller square tile in the center that resemble the blades of a spinning pinwheel. This pattern signals vintage, old New York inspiration and typically incorporates black and white or marble variations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14088" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-ADJ.jpg" alt="pinwheel basket-weave floor tiles" width="600" height="975" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-ADJ.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-ADJ-185x300.jpg 185w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-ADJ-554x900.jpg 554w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/prospect-heights-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marissa in Prospect Heights</a> went with era-appropriate black and white pinwheel basket-weave floor tiles lined with gray grout from <a href="https://www.merchantcircle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Classic Tile &amp; Marble Inc.</a> to keep the floor spotless and to add more drama to her glamorous black and white color palette.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11335" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-03.png" alt="pinwheel basket-weave floor tiles" width="600" height="480" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-03.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-03-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Allison and Jovito in Brooklyn</a> chose decorative Carrara pinwheel basket-weave marble floor tiles from <a href="https://www.lowes.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lowe’s</a> in this vintage-styled bath.</p>
<h3><strong>Hexagonal Honeycomb Patterns</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hexagonal tiles work beautifully in a natural honeycomb set. Repeating this same particular shape draws attention to the floor and lends itself well to both modern and traditional materials.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From geometric prints to Moroccan-inspired design, colorful tiles with individual patterns become the center of attention when that pattern is repeated across a small space! Encaustic cement tiles are the most common material used to get this multicolor effect.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This week, we took a swing through Park Slope for a tour of a boom-era New York bathroom that had understandably gone bust in the intervening, oh, 80 or so years. Elinor and Joel lived with the bathroom&#8217;s pros and cons and got to know it&#8217;s fickle personality well before <a dir="ltr" href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting their project</a> on Sweeten, so they were more than ready to get going when we introduced them to Sweeten Expert Niki to design and build a new bath with a strong link back to its roots. Read on down for this Brooklyn couple’s take on the process of bringing their vintage bathroom into the modern era.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/bathrooms/elinor-and-joels-park-slope-bathroom-renovation-homeowner-guest-post"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13912" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed.png" alt="unnamed" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Guest post by Elinor in Park Slope</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-13906"></span>We bought our Park Slope co-op six years ago knowing that the bathroom would have to be renovated but hoping that we wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about it for several years. The delay was partly about recovering from the process of buying our first place &#8211; which was pretty stressful &#8211; but it probably had more to do with being complete novices when it came to finding, hiring, and working with a contractor. We worried about making mistakes that could both cost us a bundle and do a lot of damage to our home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a 1920s building with a lot of original features, the bathroom still had a beautiful original tub and all of it&#8217;s pre-war tile. The plumbing, however, was also a 1920s original and some bad patches made over the years to the tile and fixtures were starting to fall apart. The medicine cabinet was rusty and so thickly painted that the door no longer closed. Towel rails fell off the wall. The shower started sending more water out of the tap than the shower head. And finally, the old regulator flush toilet sprung a leak that threatened a serious flood. Action was needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13915" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/before-1.jpg" alt="before-1" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/before-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/before-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;d read about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> in an article in the New York Times and, almost on a whim, posted our project. I was surprised by how quickly they got in touch. We were introduced to Sweeten Expert Niki who had also been mentioned in the Times article and whose name I had run across doing independent research. Working with Sweeten gave us that extra confidence to move ahead knowing we had a team that had been screened, but we also liked being able to call up Sweeten to ask questions about practical things like what to expect from the estimate process and how payment schedules are generally set up. Niki&#8217;s team was a great fit because they brought design and build expertise &#8211; we just didn&#8217;t have the time (or patience) to run all over town looking at tile samples and taps and we needed someone to help narrow down all the choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My ideal was to somehow bring the bathroom back to its shiny, original look by restoring the tile rather than starting from scratch and replacing it all. But it quickly became clear that to sort out the plumbing and move the shower head, the wall tile would have to come down and objectively, it really was too far gone to save. With that decision made, we chose materials that were as close to the originals as possible, which meant polished chrome fixtures from <a href="https://www.barclayproducts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barclay</a> (the tub filler and hand-shower), and a thermostatic control, shower head, and sink tap all from <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler</a>. We found a shiny metal medicine cabinet from <a href="https://rh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Restoration Hardware</a> and continued the original tile surround with classic subway tile in a soft cream finish (&#8220;bone gloss&#8221;) rather than the more modern pure white. We couldn&#8217;t quite replicate the original black and white frieze near the top, so we chose a plain black tile as a contrast trim instead &#8212; all from <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nemo Tile</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13919" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01" width="600" height="406" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13920 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-02.jpg" alt="rejuvenation vanity bathroom renovation" width="600" height="793" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-02-227x300.jpg 227w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13926 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-07.jpg" alt="benjamin moore teal" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-07-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original tub stayed and was reglazed; Niki and team also managed to save the original black and white floor tile. They built a new vanity with a Carrera marble top and glass pulls found on <a href="https://www.rejuvenation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rejuvenation</a>, which provides a lot of storage in a small space. They also added a modern light switch and gfi outlet so that I could finally use a hairdryer without crouching by an outlet in the bedroom. Accessories from <a href="https://www.potterybarn.com/shop/bath/?cm_type=gnav" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pottery Barn</a>, including the towel rail, glass shelf, and wall-mount light fixture fit right in with our mix of old and new. The new <a href="https://www.totousa.com/products/toilets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toto toilet</a> is light years beyond the its predecessor&#8230;no explosions or leak floods in our future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bit that no amount of research can prepare you for is how frazzled you will become: no matter how hard you try, your sense of humor will fail and you will be THAT client at some point in the process. And working with even the nicest of co-op boards will take a minimum of three months when plumbing is involved. It&#8217;s just hard to be realistic about those things up front. Niki managed the setbacks gracefully and the team worked really well with our building`s team, which is a huge help in keeping relationships friendly with your super and the neighbors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that it&#8217;s done, we love our new space and every morning I can enjoy taking a shower in the new thermostatically-controlled rainwater shower. The paint color (<a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Moore&#8217;s &#8220;Nearly Teal&#8221;</a>) never fails to cheer me up. It really is a shinier, happier version of its original self, minus the exploding toilet&#8230;!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">“It&#8217;s an amazing feeling to walk into our apartment and feel like it&#8217;s our &#8216;home&#8217; &#8212; and we owe much of that to Peter and his team.”</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">–Marie Clare K., Homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Park Slopers Marie Clare &amp; Peter purchased their first home together early this year, the couple, along with their daughter Tessa, knew the space would need some improvements in order to make it the perfect retreat for their active lifestyle. Marie Clare, a copywriter for Bobbi Brown, and Peter, who works for Mayor Bloomberg, planned to modernize the 2 bedroom home, focusing on the living space &amp; bathroom. With a great sense of style and a clear, modern vision, they posted their project ideas to Sweeten, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and chose a Sweeten general contractor for the renovation. Firm owner Peter Ramirez impressed the new homeowners by completing the project in only 3 weeks to meet their March 30th move-in &#8212; and the results are as charming as little Tessa!</p>

The homeowners wanted to create a brighter and more open space, starting with the removal of a large archway that separated the living and dining spaces.</p></div>

Marie Clare &amp; Peter are long-time subscribers to shelter blogs &amp; magazines &#8212; and their enthusiasm shows through their curated material selections and collection of furniture, lighting &amp; decorative accessories. We love the ceiling fixtures they chose for the dining and living spaces: a white/wood <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turning Pendant by West Elm</a> and an <a href="https://www.lumens.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artemis Fan by Minka Aire</a>.</p></div>

She says that the double-wide chair is perfect for taking in the beautiful view of the treetops outside her living room windows. At the far left we can see a new radiator cover that was built by NYC Pros to match the home&#8217;s traditional aesthetic.</p></div>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">“Peter Ramirez of NYC Pros delivered on every single one of his promises. He showed up when he said he would; he stuck to our budget (even suggesting areas where we could cut costs); and most importantly, he was always reachable and quick to respond to any questions or concerns we had throughout the renovation process.”</h2>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">“[The NYC Pros] team was incredibly professional and they worked double-time to make sure that our apartment would be ready for our move in date; they finished work on a Friday and we moved in the next morning!”</h2>

We love the super soft accent of  BM <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sea foam</a> as a compliment to the classic black &amp; white scheme. The floor was done with <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Embarcadero</a> tiles in Market, and <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metro</a> subway tiles in Ultra White are used in the shower; both are by Nemo Tile.</p></div>
