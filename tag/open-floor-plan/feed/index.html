										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Millwork and fireplaces set a modern outlook</h2>
<p><em>The search for a home to fit Melissa and Russ&#8217; growing family was becoming imperative. They loved their Park Slope neighborhood and sunny apartment but had already rearranged their space to fit their first child and then a second. When they found their new two-bedroom co-op in </em>a <em>historic brownstone, it had a great layout but needed updating. The couple looked on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and discovered a renovation they loved on the site’s blog. They hired the designers of that project, Casey and Kumar of <a href="https://www.studiomilleratre.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studio Miller Atre</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a>. Coincidently, it was the designers’ own Sweeten home renovation. Melissa and Russ even hired the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">same Sweeten contractor</a>!</em></p>

<p>Four years ago, when our son was only a few months old, we got serious about looking for a two-bedroom apartment. We had gotten married and moved in together only a year before, so when our son arrived, we knew we needed more space. We focused our search mainly on Park Slope and nearby areas because we loved the neighborhood, but as the months wore on, we realized how scarce nice two-bedrooms with a practical layout in our neighborhood really were.</p>
<p>Large multi-dwelling buildings had good layouts, but there were very few on the market. Most of the brownstone apartments had living rooms smaller and darker than ours, which was sunny and overlooked treetops and a church belfry across the street.</p>
<p>A year later, our daughter was born, and our quest for the perfect two-bedroom became more urgent. Still, it was hard to find something we liked. In the meantime, we had configured our apartment bedroom to accommodate one child, then reconfigured it to accommodate two, and while we were happy in our space, we were excited to find something more reasonable for the four of us.</p>

<p>When we finally found our current apartment, three full years later, we were thrilled. Situated on the third floor of a 19th-century brownstone in the Park Slope Historic District, the apartment had a great layout but was a bit run-down. The first thing we noticed was the living room, which spanned the full width of the building and had three windows overlooking a tree-filled courtyard in back. Even in March, when the branches were bare, we could sense how peaceful it was. The bedrooms faced the tree-lined street in front.</p>
<p>The unit hadn’t been updated since the building was converted to a co-op in the 1980s. We were eager to design it from scratch to make the apartment look simple and elegant. We intended to give the master bedroom to the kids and convert it into a giant playroom and keep the second bedroom for our own bed and home office. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-homes-discover-the-raw-appeal-of-exposed-brick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exposed brick walls</a> in the living room and bedroom were cold and dark, so we planned to cover them with sheetrock and paint the walls white. We also knew a custom kitchen would be our best bet.</p>

As interior designers, they did a beautiful job on their own kitchen, so we chose to hire them and the Sweeten contractors they used.</p>
<p>Because it was an open kitchen/dining/living area, we wanted to design the space in a way that wouldn’t make us feel like we were always in the kitchen. Casey and Kumar immediately understood what we were looking for and proposed a few designs that would make the kitchen space feel separate, which included building a partial wall that would eventually align with the built-in bookshelf we needed to accommodate our books. After our discussions, Kumar sent us a drawing of the proposed kitchen and bookshelf and our Sweeten contractor did an amazing job executing his vision.</p>
<p>We decided to keep the layout as it was and carve out more storage space, with floor-to-ceiling cabinets in white lacquer hiding the washer/dryer and refrigerator. In the narrow space between these two appliances, our contractor built a custom pull-out pantry.</p>
<p>On the perpendicular wall sat an exposed workspace with sink, dishwasher, and stove and ash wood veneer cabinets. We got rid of the old island, and Casey and Kumar designed an elegant new one with plenty of storage space.</p>
<p>For our countertop and backsplash, we chose soapstone, and are very happy with the result. To maintain an uncluttered countertop we had a drain board carved directly into the soapstone. My husband picked out the hardware with Casey. The kitchen is a dream.</p>

We donated them to <a href="https://www.bigreuse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Reuse</a>. We didn’t want to cover them up entirely because we wanted to retain the sense of a hearth.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;we planned white subway tile and black porcelain tiles [for the bathroom] but it evolved into something more ornate under Casey’s direction.</p></blockquote>

<p>When Kumar proposed adding mirrors matching the height of the windows on either side of what had been the fireplace, along with cabinets below, we really felt our space was coming together. The mirrors added depth and dimension, along with light being reflected. For years, we had lived in a corner apartment with plenty of windows and the addition of mirrors in our new apartment really opened the space up.</p>

We chose a gray travertine stone to line the wall with the tub, sink, and fixtures, and narrow white tiles in the bathtub area, which Casey arranged in alternating vertical and horizontal patterns.</p>

<p>Aside from one overhead light in the kitchen and one in the bathroom, the entire apartment was devoid of light fixtures. We added a pendant lamp above the dining room table and a globe lamp over the kitchen island, along with recessed lights in the living room, hallway, and bedrooms. The lights under the kitchen cabinets are especially practical and elegant. Our contractor finished the underside of the cabinets with the same ash veneer as the fronts.</p>
<p>All in all, we are tremendously happy with our space. Casey and Kumar’s vision, combined with our Sweeten general contractor’s excellent craftsmanship, resulted in a space that feels modern and civilized. The toys are contained in the children’s space, and when we manage to put everything away, our living and dining area can be free of clutter.</p>
<p>Our apartment is perfect. It’s functional and beautiful, and we love it more every day.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Melissa and Russ, for sharing your new family home with us!</em></p>
<p>DESIGN NOTES FROM STUDIO MILLER ATRE:</p>
<div>
<div><em>This project was really fun and engaging. The planning was clear from the beginning, so we were able to focus our creative efforts on spatial expression. The main shared space of the home is defined by a distinct function on each of the four sides: kitchen, dining, living, and a view of the garden through a wall of windows. </em></div>
</div>
<div>
<div><em> </em></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><em>The kitchen is anchored by a wall of full-height millwork into which all appliances and storage are neatly organized; one large millwork features a </em><em>pull-out panel. The dining area is centered on the hearth and flanked by a pair of full-height mirrors which match the dimensions of the existing windows to make what would otherwise appear a solid wall a source of light and spatial depth. The living space is nestled into a wall of books, which extends out into the main hallway to give the sitting area a bit of seclusion. Each of these elements is distinct in its function and feeling, but as a group, they form a common visual language.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Create a more functional kitchen in Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The Park Slope, Brooklyn, homeowner bought her apartment in 2008 knowing it had good bones, great outdoor space (a total score in NYC!), and loads of untapped potential. She’d already renovated the backyard and bathroom before deciding to take on the kitchen, which didn’t have an ideal flow for cooking or entertaining. A wall dividing the kitchen from the living and dining room contained a coat closet taking up valuable space. Armed with ideas on how to make it more practical for storage and cooking,  she <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/21389#before" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project on Sweeten</a>. “I had seen the blog, before-and-after pictures, and write-ups, and thought, &#8216;this is exactly what I need,&#8217;” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-BEFORE-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36413 size-chrono" title="dining room " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-BEFORE-05-723x482.jpg" alt="Park Slope, kitchen, before, renovation, remodel" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-BEFORE-05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-BEFORE-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-BEFORE-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-BEFORE-05.jpg 1084w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: She was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/admin/projects/21389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a> who created 2D and 3D sketches to help her envision the space. They knocked down the walls between the kitchen, dining room, and living room, in addition to removing an overhang (made only of drywall) that made the kitchen feel smaller. All appliances stayed in place except for the refrigerator, which moved to the wall opposite the stove. On her wish list was a place to store cookbooks, a mixer, a ladder, and coats (since the closet was now gone). Her Sweeten contractor doubled the storage with a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peninsula,</a> plus a wall of cabinets surrounding the refrigerator. “My contractor listened to all of my ideas and my wish list, which grew on a daily basis, and incorporated it all into her design seamlessly,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The homeowner and contractor worked together to choose finishes. “When it came to picking a kitchen sink faucet, I went down the rabbit hole of researching it on my own, going to showrooms, and looking at different faucets, I realized the original one my contractor recommended was actually the best of them all.” she admitted. The navy-and-white cabinets, paired with gold hardware, gave the kitchen a classic and contemporary touch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A couple&#8217;s optimism yields a washer-and-dryer—and more—in Brooklyn</h2>
<p><em>Who wants to schlep laundry up and down five flights of stairs? That’s what motivated Lynn, Craig, and their pooch Pistol to renovate their first home, a 1,200-square-foot Prospect Heights co-op. But not so fast. First, they couldn’t find a contractor willing to take on the job of remodeling two tiny bathrooms. Then they couldn’t get one on board for a washer-and-dryer install. They eventually turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, where they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> and were matched with a vetted general contractor not only </em>willing,<em> but excited, to take on the job. All this while the clock was ticking on their move-in date.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34610 size-full" title="double-hung-window-accent-light" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-12.jpg" alt="double hung window and accent lighting in living room with gray couch and rug after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><em>Guest post by Sweeten homeowners Lynn and Craig</em></p>
<p>After living in rentals forever—from 300-square-foot studios to windowless apartments— we were ready to buy something of our own. When Lynn co-founded her business—Dome, a multidisciplinary design studio—in 2014, we casually began to look for a place where she could work from home.</p>
<p>For two years, we visited open houses to learn about the Brooklyn housing market. Many of the homes felt oddly chopped up, hastily constructed, overpriced, or were projects too intimidating for us to tackle for our first home purchase. We wanted a space that felt open and bright, where we wouldn’t hit the walls within a year, and that was in a welcoming neighborhood.</p>

<p>When we found this two-bedroom, 1.5 bath co-op in a circa 1930s Prospect Heights building close to express subways, our friends, Prospect Park’s off-leash area, and saw it had lots of space and light, we immediately put in a bid. We thought we had a chance, given it was a steep fifth-floor walk-up—a deterrent for many buyers in a competitive market. We ended up losing the bid, only to have the owner come back to us weeks later offering us the home after the first deal fell through. Our move-in date was two months later, in mid-September.</p>
<p>We started out just wanting a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laundry hook-up</a> in the half-bath. We’d spent years hauling bags to coin laundromats and felt a washer-and-dryer were non-negotiable. But once we started thinking things through, our small project ballooned. We soon realized that both bathrooms needed to be gutted. The full bath had no storage and was on a 10-inch platform to accommodate mid-century plumbing. The half-bath was previously used as a cat’s bathroom, accompanied by a pet door—and a significant odor.</p>

<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Sweeten project post</a>, titled “Make These Bathrooms My Favorite Rooms” captured our optimism to transform these small, dismal rooms into a smarter space for our lifestyle and aesthetic taste. So, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose our Sweeten contractor</a>. We didn’t expand either footprint, but were strategic about how each element would really be used, cleaned, and look next to each other.</p>
<p>Overall, we replaced four bathroom and closet doors made of tired, hollow-core faux wood with solid-slab, single-panel Shaker doors. The dark wood floors in the rest of the apartment ground the space and the white walls reflect light. The high-contrast gave us a great foundation for our furniture, textiles, and plants.</p>

<p>We also saw a great opportunity to demo the dining room and envisioned a “great room” with flow between the kitchen, dining, and living rooms where we could host gatherings. After living in claustrophobic rentals, we wanted the first impression to be of openness and light.</p>
<p>Lynn’s background in exhibit design allowed us to renovate without an architect. We measured each wall’s dimension and built a model of the home in <a href="https://www.sketchup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SketchUp</a>. We could quickly see how to scale any fixtures or make changes. And, the model helped us discuss in more detail with contractors, such as rear-outlet toilets, fixture finishes, grout types, and bath fan sone ratings (for loudness).</p>

<p>The dining room walls were not load-bearing, and there are always surprises when you start opening up floors and walls. When our Sweeten contractor demo’d the dining room walls, he found charred beams in the ceiling from a long-ago fire. We had no idea there had been damage. He reinforced the ceiling with new wood to ensure structural stability.</p>

<p>In the full bathroom, which is 35 square feet, we weren’t sure if we’d be able to drop it down 10 inches. Before we had even hired our contractor, he took out his chisel and broke a peephole into the floor to see what was possible. He gave us confidence that we could make it work, ultimately dropping the entire bathroom, keeping the bathtub at the elevated height, and building out a wall for our new sink and cabinet fixtures.</p>

<p>We included so many details in this bathroom that make all the difference on a day-to-day basis, including a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighted</a> medicine cabinet with outlets inside to allow us to charge our toothbrushes out-of-sight, thereby removing clutter; the near-silent bathroom fan serves as the main light and is hidden without a vent cover; and a wall-hung sink and cabinet allows for more storage and easier cleaning underneath.</p>

<p>As for the half-bath—only 24 square feet—several contractors, who initially inspected the job advised us to forego the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer-and-dryer</a> altogether, saying it was impossible, or that we had to tap into our toilet line and disrupt the apartment below. Our Sweeten contractor&#8217;s plumbing team found a simpler solution by tapping into the small sink&#8217;s line. We got a compact, ventless Bosch washer-and-dryer to accommodate the water line, electrical load, and tight space in the bath. Remodeling this room has been a life-changer.</p>
<p>The other issue in this space was the overwhelming odor of cat urine. We tried every odor-reducing spray and paint on the market, and used black lights to expose urination spots, but in the end, we had our contractor gut the walls and floor down to the slab to remove the contaminated wood. Every visit during the renovation had our contractor sniffing in corners, trying to find new origins of contamination. Thankfully, it does not smell like cat pee anymore. We also replaced the dated fixtures in that bath with the smallest toilet and sink we could find.</p>

<p>Overall, everything went pretty smoothly. Our biggest challenge, really, had been finding a contractor. But Sweeten gave us three leads, and our contractor came to the first meeting as if he already had the job, giving realistic explanations for what it would take to accomplish the work. During the renovation, he rarely said no or told us a change wasn&#8217;t possible. As we added to our original scope, he was incredibly flexible and adjusted his timeline and the work to hit our mid-September move-in date. He gave us recommendations when we didn’t know what to buy, explained to us what was needed, and helped us quickly to complete the work.</p>

<p>Sweeten helped us, too, by getting us to clarify our scope and put a realistic budget into our initial post. We learned that even though our timeline was compressed, renovating a home is practically a second job if you undertake it on your own with just a contractor. We now understand why people hire architects. For those with less design experience or who are strapped for time, it would be helpful to work with a professional who can do the groundwork for you.</p>

<p>Another piece of advice is if you can do a major renovation before moving in, bite the bullet and get it done. Don’t put off with cleaning the dust later on. We plan to continue renovating in phases, but wanted to get the most disruptive work completed before moving in.</p>
<p>Having gone through four rentals in six years, we always struggled to feel at home. Our new space is beautiful and feels like something we can make our own. We enjoy inviting others into it as often as possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Plans include an open kitchen, new closets, oak floors, and embracing the “cons” of Carrara marble</h2>
<p><i>A search for a home to suit their growing family led Marissa and Cody from the West Village to a beautiful spot in northern Manhattan. The apartment, a two-bed, one-bath corner unit, was located on a steep hill in the neighborhood of Hudson Heights. (Fun fact: the building’s foundation sits on a lattice of 40-foot steel stilts!) It came with soaring views of the city, gorgeous light from its north- and east-facing windows, and felt “more like San Francisco than New York City.” The unit’s interior needed some updating, and Cody, an architect, was up to the task. </i><span class="s1"><i>Paired up with a contractor from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors,</i></span><span class="s1"><i> they </i></span><i>knocked down a wall closing in the galley kitchen to connect it to the living room<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>creating an open kitchen design<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>removed a nib wall, and made changes to the bath as well as the floors and closets throughout. Read on for how the couple created a warm but modern home for themselves, their daughter Lucia, and a new baby on the way.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cody says</span>: </i></span>We had been renting a one-bedroom apartment in the West Village for seven years. We started looking to buy an apartment when Marissa became pregnant, and homed in on northern Manhattan to give her a reasonable commute to Columbia University (we had ruled out several neighborhoods in Brooklyn for this reason). Our first impression of Hudson Heights was that it felt like a small village tucked away in the city, surrounded by amazing views and parks. We visited on a snowy winter day, and saw a cross-country skier in the middle of the street!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We continued to look more seriously after our daughter, Lucia, was born, and finally closed on an apartment in March 2016: a two-bed, one-bath, 1,000-square-foot apartment in a 1960s co-op building. Though the postwar construction did not have some of the Art Deco, prewar detailing that is typical of the neighborhood, it did lend itself to a simple and logical floor plan and had thru-wall air conditioning units<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>allowing in even more light than apartments we saw with window units.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marissa says</span>:</i></span> Cody is an architect, and we wanted something we could renovate and make our own. While continuing to live in our West Village apartment, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6369" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> to Sweeten and went with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten contractor</a> who was professional, communicative, and direct. The renovation took eight weeks (two weeks under the projected schedule the contractor proposed!), and we moved in just after he finished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of our overall vision, first and foremost we wanted to join the kitchen to the living space. We hoped to make the apartment feel open, light, and modern, but warm and homey at the same time. We were drawn to a clean and minimal palette, especially in the kitchen. Cody is an avid home cook, and we knew the kitchen would be the heart of the home. We maximized where we could—for example, with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/refrigerator-chill-world-fridge-freezer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">36-inch wide refrigerator</a>, five-burner range, 23-inch stainless steel undermount sink. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">six-foot island</a> is our home base, the place where we naturally gravitate throughout the day or when we have friends over.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-26-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26378 size-chrono" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-26-1-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26360 mb-0 size-chrono" title="shelves for cookbooks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On a related note, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-kitchen-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA kitchen</a> cabinet system is amazing for the price point. There are an infinite number of modular configurations and we achieved a result that is nearly indistinguishable from a custom kitchen. The upper cabinets are 40 inches tall and extend to the ceiling, allowing for tons of storage (we never thought we would have empty shelves while living in NYC!). It was important for us to use “real” materials like stone and wood to accent specific moments. For example, we selected the white <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carrara marble</a> knowing full well it would take a beating. We loved the idea that every scratch, etch, and stain will continue to give it character over time.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26361 mb-0 size-chrono" title="view from the kitchen into the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given that an open kitchen design and living area was our primary goal, the first question we asked ourselves when viewing a potential apartment was: “Can we connect the kitchen to the living space?” The existing kitchen in our apartment was a long and narrow galley. Knocking down the wall allowed us to redesign the entire room, maximizing storage and functionality while linking the main living spaces. It also made the room much brighter<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>the window in the kitchen brings in tons more light to the living and dining room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedrooms, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinished</a> the floors with a lighter and more natural oak. We love how they seem to brighten up both spaces now. We also redid the closets in both rooms; in the master bedroom we were able to do the floor-to-ceiling pivot hinges, just like in the living space, but in Lucia&#8217;s room a beam prevented us from doing the same. We were still able to reframe her closet and maximize storage with a new shelving system. We also bought very minimal ceiling light fixtures for each room, which blend in while providing extra ambient light. All of that, plus the square-stock baseboards and door casings, really spruced up both rooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26362 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26363 size-chrono" title="master bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-24-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-25.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26364 mb-0 size-chrono" title="master bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-25-723x1085.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also eliminated a small nib wall in the living room that separated the front living space from the bedrooms in the back of the apartment. With the nib wall gone, there is a direct line of sight to the windows in Lucia’s bedroom, which brightens the entire apartment and creates a feeling of spaciousness.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26367 size-chrono" title="office nook" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26426 mb-0 size-chrono" title="closets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Outside of the kitchen and living room project, we also saw the opportunity to reframe the closets throughout the apartment, remove the existing sliding bypass closet doors, and replace them with floor-to-ceiling pivot hinged doors. This created ample storage, and the verticality of the doors and their accompanying hardware became a design feature consistent in every room. The reconfiguration that resulted in an open kitchen design also allowed us to create a new hallway linen closet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We made a few changes to the bathroom which made a big difference in the final look. We replaced the pedestal sink for a wall mounted <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> which created a lot more storage, replaced the old shower bypass glass doors with a fixed glass panel, and gave it a fresh coat of gray paint. We kept the tiles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting fixtures,</a> and towel racks from the previous design.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26370 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26371 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most surprising moment of the whole process was when our contractor sent us some photos after the first day of demolition. There was a huge pile of debris in the middle of the apartment, and a raw opening between the kitchen and living room and around each closet. Beams, columns, electrical conduit, and wiring were totally exposed. It was a shock to realize how much work we were really putting into the renovation. There was no turning back, and we could only hope that all the planning and design preparation going into the project would work out. Eight weeks later, it was a finished project and we could not have been happier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We can’t recommend our Sweeten contractor enough. Although his <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bid</a> was slightly higher than the others we received, we immediately got the sense that he would deliver a high-quality product, not exceed his budget, and stick to his schedule. All of this turned out to be accurate. We felt most comfortable with him from day one. He and Cody collaborated extensively throughout the renovation, and had a clear line of communication. He did not disappoint us in any respect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s important to remember that there are many unknowns in the renovation process, and many pieces that are out of your control. Until we knocked down the wall between the living room and kitchen, we did not know for certain what would be behind it. (We had done a small probe to look for pipes, and based on the short span, we assumed that there were not any structural elements.) We couldn’t know for sure the location of the plumbing and gas risers until demolition was complete, which would ultimately dictate where we placed the kitchen sink and oven. It turned out that the gas riser was floating off the perimeter wall by almost 24 inches, and we had initially assumed it would be right along the perimeter wall. As a result, the opening to the kitchen had to be cut short. Although it was initially a disappointment, we used the 24-inch wall as an opportunity to put in a small cabinet and countertop, with wooden shelves above. It ended up being a great addition to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open kitchen design</a>, even though we hadn’t anticipated it!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26379 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our advice to future renovators: make your design choices ahead of time and stick to them. You don’t want to be redesigning in the middle of construction. If there are any surprises during construction (like the location of a gas riser<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>see above), it is critical to make a thoughtful yet quick decision and keep moving forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are so happy with the apartment. It turned out just as we had envisioned it, and it’s been great to have so much space! We had been living in a 600-square-foot one-bedroom for Lucia’s first year, and by the time we moved out, we were feeling very cramped. Now, we’re expecting our second baby, and it feels like there is plenty of room to grow. But if the day comes when we do need more space and we start looking for our next renovation project, we’ll certainly use Sweeten again!</p>
<p><i>What a thoughtful and beautiful redesign, Cody! Thanks to you, Marissa, and Lucia for a glimpse into your home. </i></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Open floor plans are all the rage—so much so that the first temptation of a renovating homeowner may be to tear down walls. But before you bring in the wrecking ball, consider if you&#8217;ll have enough personal space for your family (or frequent overnight guests), and how a strategically placed wall or partition can maximize your space at home while defining the private areas of your home. Take cues from these Sweeten homeowners and their clever uses of space, from carving out niches and capturing square footage in other areas to adding moveable partitions for smooth transitions.</span></p>

<h3>Transom windows allow for a guest bedroom to be added</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an L-shaped living room in their new apartment, Deeksha and Joe saw the opportunity to create a guest bedroom. All they needed to do was add a wall and a doorway. The only problem was that the placement of the wall would block the light and hide a gorgeous view from the corner windows. A unique solution—an interior wall of windows—provides the necessary privacy for the guest bedroom while still allowing the flow of light to reach the rest of the living room. The new space also serves as a light-filled workspace for the family.</p>

<h3>Custom sliding doors to help maximize a 500 square-foot home</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Claire and Dan purchased their 500-square-foot studio apartment, they knew it needed a renovation. The unit hadn’t been updated since the &#8217;60s, and the couple wanted to build out a junior one-bedroom by separating the living/kitchen area from the sleeping space. With DOB regulations preventing permanent wall additions, they worked with their architect and Sweeten general contractor to install custom sliding doors. With the sliding doors, they maximize their space at home by keeping the space open during the day, and closing them for privacy or while entertaining. </span></p>

<h3>Strategically removing a hallway adds space (and light!)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long hallway was the main culprit of wasted space in Walter and Laura’s Park Slope apartment. By removing their entry hallway, they imbued their apartment with more natural light</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and space. With the newly-provided footage, their kitchen swapped places with a spare bedroom and got an expanded, angular footprint in the foyer. A small dining/entertaining area was also added to the kitchen, allowing guests to visit with the couple while they cooked. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Adding a wall creates a new bedroom, while transom windows let in soft light</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The notion of adding a dishwasher to their kitchen escalated into a full gut renovation, and then took another, unexpected turn when Chris and Amber found out their second child was on the way. The project was now an opportunity to carve out a room for their older son. A wall was added to separate the dining nook from the rest of the kitchen, turning it into a bedroom, and a milk glass transom window was installed above the doorway to allow light to filter through. Finishing touches; a crib, picture shelves, roller blinds, and a colorful rug complete the transformation from dining nook to a growing boy&#8217;s bedroom.</p>

<h3><strong>A studio morphs into a one-bedroom with the help of a full dividing wall</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New homeowner Paul landed his perfect apartment by getting creative in his search: instead of buying a “true” one-bedroom apartment in Hell’s Kitchen, he purchased a studio that was listed as a junior one bedroom. Paul noticed the apartment’s previous owner was already mimicking a one-bedroom layout by using a built-in bookcase to separate the bedroom and living area. He replicated this layout in his renovation by having this general contractor add a full dividing wall (with a pocket door) to separate his living area from his bedroom. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Turning a studio into a two-bedroom (yes, really!) with movable partitions </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal planned on making their studio function as a two-bedroom; not an easy feat, considering the apartment’s existing open-plan layout. They added a custom king-size platform bed in the space designated as the master bedroom. The key feature, movable partitions, allow it to work as a space for sleep or as another part of the home. For the &#8220;second bedroom,&#8221; a queen-size Murphy bed that folds up horizontally to save space and a closet were installed in the area designated as the living room, which uses the same sliding doors for privacy. As an added bonus, the wall unit that houses the pull-out bed and closet blends into the surrounding walls when the bed is tucked away.</p>

<h3><strong>Major wall movement reshapes an entire 700 square-foot apartment layout</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn one bedroom into two, create a walk-in closet, and make a dining space fit for hosting: these items topped the to-do list for sisters (and roommates) Deanna and Daria’s renovation in New York’s Sutton Place. To really maximize space at their home, construction moved walls from the existing dining room, living room and bedroom to reshape the new rooms: nearly the entire space of the apartment. Now, their 700 square-foot apartment maximizes every inch of space while showcasing the sisters’ preference for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bold patterns and color. </span></p>

<h3><strong>To maximize space at home for a new baby, walls &amp; a doorway create a nursery </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to make their one-bedroom apartment family-ready, Karen and Kevin set their sights on converting a dining nook situated at the tail end of the kitchen into a nursery for their daughter. They added a new wall and doorway, which allows  for entry from the main living area. The new nursery, now completely separate from the kitchen, receives a flood of sunlight during the day, an added benefit from the window it inherited from the former dining area.</p>

<h3><strong>A retractable partition create privacy for parents and children in a one-bedroom</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A one-bedroom in a coveted neighborhood inspired Casey and Kumar to maximize space at home for their four-person family. After examining their family’s daily routines, the couple decided to give their sons the master bedroom so that they would have a space for playtime and bedtime. They added a multipurpose space in the living area with a wall of custom millwork and a pull-out bed. This became the space that Casey and Kumar could sleep and store their clothes. To preserve privacy and block light and noise, a retractable partition now divides the designated sleeping space from the rest of the home. The addition of the partition now offers flexibility for the family&#8217;s daily needs.</p>

<h3><strong>Need your one-bedroom to be a two-bedroom? Demo a closet, build a partition, add a door. Voila!</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way, Lindsay and Matt needed to turn their one-bedroom into a two-bedroom apartment. They planned to do this by splitting the existing bedroom into a master bedroom and nursery. A few key layout changes made this all possible: demolishing closets to gain back valuable square footage, building a partition, and creating a doorway that opened into the living room. These newly constructed spaces have allowed the home to reach its full potential by making room for the whole family.</p>
