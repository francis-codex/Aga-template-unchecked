<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Landing a historic fixer-upper in Chicago</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Our apartment, which we bought in 2019, is in a historic greystone building in Chicago’s Lakeview East neighborhood. A three-bedroom fixer-upper, we chose it knowing we could renovate it to our exact specifications. The unit had, curiously, two front doors, neither of which was in a logical location, and we wanted to find a solution to that problem. We needed to renovate the two <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathrooms</a>, which had been largely untouched for decades. And finally, we wanted to redo the living-room fireplace façade as a finishing touch to our renovation.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03.jpg" alt="Living area with window alcove and fireplace" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">The apartment is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-floor unit</a> in a three-flat building; it’s around 1,575 square feet and has a 160-square-foot rear deck. We have two French bulldogs and wanted the condominium for its generous size, but we also appreciated its historic status and original character. We’d noticed that historic properties often had their period aspects stripped out. We wanted to bring modern updates to the space, maintain its vintage features, and incorporate mid-century touches into our design.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">We’d recently completed a challenging remodel of the condominium’s kitchen, and felt we needed a new contractor to tackle the next phase. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, fielded responses, and soon found a contractor we believed was well-matched to the job.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Solving an odd problem: two front doors</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Moving our home’s entrance door was perhaps the change that required the most thought. Originally, the apartment had two front doors! One went into the living room, and the other opened into the smallest of our three bedrooms, which we think was the housekeeper’s room at some point. Door No. 1 limited the wall space in our relaxing and entertaining room. Door No. 2 made that tiny bedroom even smaller and less functional. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01.jpg" alt="Entryway leading into the dining area" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s8"></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8">Initially, we’d decided to make the door to the small bedroom our primary front door, converting that room to a foyer. We’d tear out the door leading to the living room and drywall over it. This approach would have required only a slight expansion of the width of that door opening to the bedroom, and replacing trim in a couple of spots. But in the end, we decided the quick fix wasn’t the best option.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s8">Remodeling a new apartment entry</span></h3>
<p>After discussing it with our Sweeten contractor, we decided on a plan to create yet a third door. We would close off the two original entry doors and move the apartment’s front door to a new location in the dining room. These changes would give us full walls in both rooms. Closing Door No. 1 ultimately allowed for a friendlier, more functional furniture arrangement in the living room. Eliminating Door No. 2 created space for us to install a large storage system comprising a Murphy bed and a desk in the former housekeeper’s room. Two absolute wins.</p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Bed.gif" alt="Gif of the murphy bed closing and transforming into a desk" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52415" /></span></h3>
<p><span class="s8">Now our apartment needed an entirely new entry. For the new opening, we chose a modern front door that contrasts with the vintage character of the dining and living rooms within. We’re particularly happy about the contrast between “new and old” as you enter our home.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Two black-and-white bathroom upgrades</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s9">Next, we moved on to updating the two </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/two-bathroom-renovation-for-resale-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s8">small </span><span class="s9">bathrooms</span></a><span class="s8">. We wanted to update the plumbing, tiling, and fixtures, plus add exhaust fans to both baths. We planned to source and provide all fixtures, including a bathtub, faucets, lighting, fans, and more. To stay on budget, we asked our contractor to provide only the rough materials and labor. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16.jpg" alt="Bathroom with white tiles, black tiled floor, and glass paneled shower" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52412" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p><span class="s8">&#8220;We found Sweeten’s detailed contractor reviews helpful, and credit those in part for our successful hire.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Aiming for a clean aesthetic consistent with our just-completed kitchen, we chose to tile every wall surface from <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/white-subway-tile-bathroom-7-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor to ceiling with white subway tile</a>. We’re pleased with the way this brings attention to our 10-foot ceilings. We chose similarly timeless black marble hex tile for the floors, hoping it would conceal dirt, hair, and other buildups between regular cleanings. Finally, we indulged our love of mid-century furniture, integrating matching bathroom vanities of that era’s style.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15.jpg" alt="Bathroom with white subway tile and matte black fixtures" width="1000" height="664" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52411" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15-300x199.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15-600x398.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14.jpg" alt="Bathroom with white subway tile and small wooden vanity" width="1000" height="1555" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52410" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14-193x300.jpg 193w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14-579x900.jpg 579w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3 class="p6"><span class="s8">Achieving a sleek subway tile fireplace</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8">The last idea we wanted to implement was in the living room, where we’d decided to add decorative subway tile around the original fireplace. When we purchased the apartment, the walls around the firebox were drywalled; </span><span class="s9">we wanted to reclaim the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/adding-fireplace-renovation-gas-wood-burning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace’s role as a focal point</a> for the living space. We chose a glossy white subway tile for the new fireplace façade to brighten the space. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">The key to finding the right general contractor in Chicago</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Everything went remarkably smooth with the string of projects. Our Sweeten contractor was professional and provided clear <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advice on issues big and small</a>, including the placement of fixtures, the color of the grout, and more. We leaned heavily on our contractor’s expertise. We experienced no real challenges—this was in contrast to our experience during other phases of our broader renovation, with different contractors. We’ve renovated before, and we know: The wrong contractor can add unnecessary stress, delays, and cost. The right contractor can make the process relatively painless.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04.jpg" alt="White tiled fireplace with decorative clock above" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52408" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17.jpg" alt="Exterior of the home in Chicago" width="1000" height="1472" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52413" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17-204x300.jpg 204w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17-600x883.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s8">We found Sweeten’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovators-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed contractor reviews</a> helpful, and credit those in part for our successful hire. We appreciated the additional insurance—and assurance—Sweeten provided. The right resources helped us to mostly <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2020-home-renovation-costs-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay on budget</a>, too. We had no major cost overruns. A few of our fixtures arrived damaged, but we were able to quickly source replacements and stay on schedule.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">The end result has made us very happy. We’re satisfied with our design choices, and the way our contractor’s work and craftsmanship aligned with our vision. It’s all about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding the right partner</a> for the project.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Americans have become highly sophisticated about their renovation choices and preferences. And nowhere is this more evident than in the bath. Homeowners count on their bathrooms to help them rev up in the morning and wind down in the evening. Manufacturers now create elaborate shower systems that provide a luxurious shower experience. Here, Sweeten&#8217;s guide to modern shower systems outlines popular features and add-ons, with tips on adding one into your bathroom remodel plans.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Design to go with the flow</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s begin with the layout. Shower systems should be isolated, almost like a room, and shouldn&#8217;t be part of a tub. While it doesn’t have to be big enough to fit two, there should be enough footage to move around and extend your arms fully. Simple materials and clean lines deliver the best aesthetic to convey a feeling of serenity. This means frameless glass doors and a floor-level shower tray. (Bonus: It’s fully accessible!) A built-in bench, particularly if the shower is clad in <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stone</a>, adds another luxurious touch. Make sure you assess your plumbing capacity to be sure it can supply sufficient volume pressure. Your water heater must also be ready if you include a steam shower or body jets. (These features often operate at the same time as the shower.) Ensure your contractor evaluates the drain so it evacuates all that water quickly. Next, you&#8217;ll want to plan your shower system features!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Luxury shower system options</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luxury shower systems in the home go way beyond simple showerheads, even one with diverse spray patterns. The typical luxury shower system is a combination of individual features that come as a unit in a panel, or those you choose individually. You&#8217;ll want a shower head with several spray patterns, a hand shower on a wall-mount slide bar, and several pairs of body jets (six to eight are common). This arrangement should come with a thermostatic diverter that controls the water temperature to a preset degree. This means you don’t have to fiddle with it each time you turn it on.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Shower panels</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a few hundred dollars, you can find an all-in-one shower panel at a box store such as Home Depot. (This is at least half of what you would spend on a shower system of individual components.) The panel includes a showerhead, two to eight body jets, and an adjustable hand shower. Advantageously, a shower panel provides quick installation at a price that fits most budgets. The disadvantage: the panel mounts to the wall, extending several inches into the shower space. If you want a sleeker look, you will need to go with individual components that recess into the wall. Either way, make sure that your plumbing provides sufficient water pressure for all the features to operate simultaneously. If not, your contractor should make adjustments before installation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rain shower heads</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An increasingly popular type of luxury shower head is the rain shower head. Rain shower heads are preferred for the soothing effect that its name indicates. These luxury-type shower heads can be mounted to the wall and angled to drop directly down, or installed on the ceiling. Look for an extra-wide spray span, as much as 15 inches, and a choice of spray patterns, from gentle to drenching. <a href="https://www.grohe.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grohe</a> and <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler</a> also offer digital controls with their rain shower systems. These controls allow you to preset your favorite spray pattern with your preferred water temperature. You simply push a button to start your shower and enter your specific experience. Kohler developed a showering panel that simulates the varying sizes and angles of raindrops as they fall, for a fully sensory occurrence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you really want to splurge, you can get a shower panel installed in the ceiling that will shower you with several spray patterns simultaneously. This requires special framing for the ceiling, so you need to plan this feature before you start your renovation.</p>

<h3>Body sprays</h3>
<p>These components allow for water therapy that hits every inch of your body to soothe or stimulate. Surface-mounted or recessed, the sprays are typically installed in pairs. Pay careful attention to placement, particularly if people of varying heights will use the shower. Swivel body sprays can help for minor adjustments. The top-level jets target the shoulders, the middle, the waist or hips, and the lowest, the thighs or knees. Some jets pop out when in operation, then retract when the water is turned off. You can find these sprays in the classic faucet and showerhead finishes—chrome, nickel, bronze, polished or brushed—and in square or round shapes from most major manufacturers including <a href="https://www.americanstandard-us.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Standard</a>, Kohler, <a href="https://www.hansgrohe-usa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hansgrohe</a>, Grohe, <a href="https://www.deltafaucet.com/bathroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delta</a>, and <a href="https://www.moen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moen</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Steam</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Technological advances have made it possible to bring the coveted spa experience of steam into modern homes. The operation appears simple: steam is emitted by heads installed on the shower wall, and operated by a control pad programmed for temperature and session length. However, you will need to plan with your contractor to allow for several precautions. Don&#8217;t forget: steam showers generate more moisture and heat than a regular shower. As a result, your contractor will first install vapor proofing material to prevent water vapor from seeping through the walls. The shower door should be airtight, too, so water doesn’t escape to create mildew on wallpaper and paint. The ceiling should be curved so that condensed vapor droplets run down the walls, instead of dripping on you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For operation, a steam shower requires a generator and a ventilation unit. Both of these features are concealed from sight. Accordingly, your contractor can help you to determine the best, most effective placement for each. Alternatively, you can buy a stand-alone steam shower, complete with rain shower, hand shower, massage jets, whirlpool tub, steam generator, and LED lighting. Companies that specialize in steam showers, as well as major manufacturers like Kohler or <a href="https://www.whirlpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whirlpool</a>, offer many choices. If you don&#8217;t want to go the custom route, a two-person unit will cost you about $2,000. If you are creating a custom steam shower, expect your costs to double, to about $4,000. For either route: work with a contractor to ensure properly-installed plumbing and electricity.</p>

<h4>Seating for shower systems</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When planning to introduce a steam shower to your bathroom, plan for it to be big enough for at least two people to use. Also, allow footage for a bench for lounging and even reclining.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Chromotherapy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know that humans crave the healing power of light based on our innate need for sunlight and full-spectrum light in wintertime. You can isolate the individual colors that make up full-spectrum for healing effects in the bath. This is called chromotherapy. You’ll want at least four <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lights</a> installed in your shower ceiling for even illumination. You can find LED versions in primary colors, and connect them to a separate switch in the shower. Amazon sells chromotherapy bulbs in seven colors—orange, red, blue, aqua, indigo, green, and yellow. You can change them at will, or set them to cycle through all the colors. Make sure your contractor adds a dimming capability. You can also choose a chromotherapy package made to go with a tub or steam shower enclosure from a manufacturer.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Adding music to your shower system</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once upon a time, you set your radio on the counter to listen to news and music. Kohler is among a handful of manufacturers that lets you bring music right into the shower. They offer a shower head with a wireless speaker that you can connect to your phone with Bluetooth® technology. The speaker docks in the center of the showerhead when in use, and is removable for recharging the battery, which lasts up to seven hours. The showerhead is available as a wall-mount or rain shower. Grohe also makes a rechargeable wireless speaker that attaches to the slide bar of the hand shower. For under $100, you can opt for wireless Bluetooth® speakers, compatible with most smartphones, that attach to the wall by suction cups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to the bathroom, it makes sense that your shower should provide the personalized experience you seek. By adding one or all of the features described above, you can luxuriate in your favorite spa rituals every day without leaving home.</p>
