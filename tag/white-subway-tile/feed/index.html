<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Landing a historic fixer-upper in Chicago</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Our apartment, which we bought in 2019, is in a historic greystone building in Chicago’s Lakeview East neighborhood. A three-bedroom fixer-upper, we chose it knowing we could renovate it to our exact specifications. The unit had, curiously, two front doors, neither of which was in a logical location, and we wanted to find a solution to that problem. We needed to renovate the two <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathrooms</a>, which had been largely untouched for decades. And finally, we wanted to redo the living-room fireplace façade as a finishing touch to our renovation.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03.jpg" alt="Living area with window alcove and fireplace" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">The apartment is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-floor unit</a> in a three-flat building; it’s around 1,575 square feet and has a 160-square-foot rear deck. We have two French bulldogs and wanted the condominium for its generous size, but we also appreciated its historic status and original character. We’d noticed that historic properties often had their period aspects stripped out. We wanted to bring modern updates to the space, maintain its vintage features, and incorporate mid-century touches into our design.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">We’d recently completed a challenging remodel of the condominium’s kitchen, and felt we needed a new contractor to tackle the next phase. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, fielded responses, and soon found a contractor we believed was well-matched to the job.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Solving an odd problem: two front doors</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Moving our home’s entrance door was perhaps the change that required the most thought. Originally, the apartment had two front doors! One went into the living room, and the other opened into the smallest of our three bedrooms, which we think was the housekeeper’s room at some point. Door No. 1 limited the wall space in our relaxing and entertaining room. Door No. 2 made that tiny bedroom even smaller and less functional. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01.jpg" alt="Entryway leading into the dining area" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s8"></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8">Initially, we’d decided to make the door to the small bedroom our primary front door, converting that room to a foyer. We’d tear out the door leading to the living room and drywall over it. This approach would have required only a slight expansion of the width of that door opening to the bedroom, and replacing trim in a couple of spots. But in the end, we decided the quick fix wasn’t the best option.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s8">Remodeling a new apartment entry</span></h3>
<p>After discussing it with our Sweeten contractor, we decided on a plan to create yet a third door. We would close off the two original entry doors and move the apartment’s front door to a new location in the dining room. These changes would give us full walls in both rooms. Closing Door No. 1 ultimately allowed for a friendlier, more functional furniture arrangement in the living room. Eliminating Door No. 2 created space for us to install a large storage system comprising a Murphy bed and a desk in the former housekeeper’s room. Two absolute wins.</p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Bed.gif" alt="Gif of the murphy bed closing and transforming into a desk" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52415" /></span></h3>
<p><span class="s8">Now our apartment needed an entirely new entry. For the new opening, we chose a modern front door that contrasts with the vintage character of the dining and living rooms within. We’re particularly happy about the contrast between “new and old” as you enter our home.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Two black-and-white bathroom upgrades</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s9">Next, we moved on to updating the two </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/two-bathroom-renovation-for-resale-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s8">small </span><span class="s9">bathrooms</span></a><span class="s8">. We wanted to update the plumbing, tiling, and fixtures, plus add exhaust fans to both baths. We planned to source and provide all fixtures, including a bathtub, faucets, lighting, fans, and more. To stay on budget, we asked our contractor to provide only the rough materials and labor. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16.jpg" alt="Bathroom with white tiles, black tiled floor, and glass paneled shower" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52412" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-16-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p><span class="s8">&#8220;We found Sweeten’s detailed contractor reviews helpful, and credit those in part for our successful hire.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Aiming for a clean aesthetic consistent with our just-completed kitchen, we chose to tile every wall surface from <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/white-subway-tile-bathroom-7-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor to ceiling with white subway tile</a>. We’re pleased with the way this brings attention to our 10-foot ceilings. We chose similarly timeless black marble hex tile for the floors, hoping it would conceal dirt, hair, and other buildups between regular cleanings. Finally, we indulged our love of mid-century furniture, integrating matching bathroom vanities of that era’s style.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15.jpg" alt="Bathroom with white subway tile and matte black fixtures" width="1000" height="664" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52411" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15-300x199.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-15-600x398.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14.jpg" alt="Bathroom with white subway tile and small wooden vanity" width="1000" height="1555" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52410" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14-193x300.jpg 193w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-14-579x900.jpg 579w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3 class="p6"><span class="s8">Achieving a sleek subway tile fireplace</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s8">The last idea we wanted to implement was in the living room, where we’d decided to add decorative subway tile around the original fireplace. When we purchased the apartment, the walls around the firebox were drywalled; </span><span class="s9">we wanted to reclaim the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/adding-fireplace-renovation-gas-wood-burning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace’s role as a focal point</a> for the living space. We chose a glossy white subway tile for the new fireplace façade to brighten the space. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">The key to finding the right general contractor in Chicago</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Everything went remarkably smooth with the string of projects. Our Sweeten contractor was professional and provided clear <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advice on issues big and small</a>, including the placement of fixtures, the color of the grout, and more. We leaned heavily on our contractor’s expertise. We experienced no real challenges—this was in contrast to our experience during other phases of our broader renovation, with different contractors. We’ve renovated before, and we know: The wrong contractor can add unnecessary stress, delays, and cost. The right contractor can make the process relatively painless.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04.jpg" alt="White tiled fireplace with decorative clock above" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52408" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s8"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17.jpg" alt="Exterior of the home in Chicago" width="1000" height="1472" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52413" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17-204x300.jpg 204w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96250-Stephen-Apt-17-600x883.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s8">We found Sweeten’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovators-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed contractor reviews</a> helpful, and credit those in part for our successful hire. We appreciated the additional insurance—and assurance—Sweeten provided. The right resources helped us to mostly <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2020-home-renovation-costs-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay on budget</a>, too. We had no major cost overruns. A few of our fixtures arrived damaged, but we were able to quickly source replacements and stay on schedule.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">The end result has made us very happy. We’re satisfied with our design choices, and the way our contractor’s work and craftsmanship aligned with our vision. It’s all about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding the right partner</a> for the project.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Bathroom remodel “must-haves”</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Our home is a wood-frame row house in Jersey City, New Jersey. It’s 150 years old, has three floors, and 1,000 square feet. </span><span class="s1">When we first visited the house more than five years ago, I fell in love with the main bathroom’s vintage mint-green bathtub. I knew I wanted to preserve it. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our home is historic, but over the years and through many renovations, most of its charm had been lost. T</span><span class="s2">he house’s two bathrooms are “newer”—added at some point onto the back of the house. The one we wanted to update is on the second floor, off of the primary bedroom. </span><span class="s1">It’s our only full bathroom. </span><span class="s3">We didn’t want to change the floor plan, but had a goal of</span><span class="s1"> modernizing while injecting a vintage feel. We planned to do this by</span><span class="s3"> keeping the original tub and adding a period medicine cabinet we’d found. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our second goal was to make the room warmer. We suspected it wasn’t properly insulated because it got so cold in winter</span><span class="s3">. </span><span class="s1">We’d lived in this house for five long winters, but there was never a good time to improve on it.</span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Staying home during the remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">We embarked on the bathroom renovation last summer. Our household—two adults and two cats—had</span><span class="s1"> been working from home since the pandemic began in March 2020. My partner and I are handy and we’ve done many projects ourselves, including tile work, sheetrock, trim, carpentry, and minor plumbing and electrical work. We have a good sense of how things should be done, but we didn’t have the personal bandwidth <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/diy-vs-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to complete this project ourselves</a>. Luckily, the lockdown gave us the flexibility to have our only full bathroom out of commission. We would not have a shower during the bathroom renovation, but we had a backyard with a hose! </span><span class="s4">We would prioritize our bathtub and shower update, then move to the rest of the bathroom. </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Style sparks inspiration for the vintage bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> post, we mentioned the mint-green bathtub and our desire to work with it. We wanted the tub to feel intentional in the space, rather than something that was left there because it was too heavy or too expensive to get rid of. To make the room feel more “classic,” we wanted to introduce vintage elements, but merge them with a modern design. Posting our project on Sweeten made it possible for us to “take the plunge.” We were hesitant about hiring a contractor, but Sweeten gave us confidence, knowing we wouldn’t be going it alone.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Improving the bathroom layout</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">As planned, we did not change the bathroom layout, but some demolition discoveries influenced the project. </span><span class="s5">We found remnants of original pastel pink tiles near the tub—but while the color combination was classic in the bathroom’s era, we decided not to go so bold. With</span><span class="s1"> the walls down, we saw that we not only needed additional insulation behind the new sheetrock but in the ceiling as well. We also noticed that the ceiling near the door had been dropped by several feet. Pulling it down and replacing it offered an opportunity to open and visually enlarge the space. This nice surprise changed the whole feeling of the room.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Picking bathroom tiles</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finding modern tiles that seemed true to the historic nature of the house, but that would also play well with the tub, wasn’t easy. Matching tile to vintage mint-green porcelain is impossible, and coordinating colors—other than neutrals—are limited. We’d first selected a different floor tile, also with a green marble effect, but when we tried to order, it was no longer available. We’d already chosen a project start date so we scrambled to find a replacement. Fortunately, we found this mosaic polished stone tile. It was <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-much-does-it-cost-to-tile-a-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more expensive than our original pick</a>, which gave us pause, but we needed to move forward. I love how it complements the tub.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor used inspirational photos and sketched the design for the inlaid black pencil tile. He then executed it beautifully and it came out exactly as we’d hoped. The white wall tile has a vintage vibe but is simpler, allowing the tub and floor tile to shine.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Design ideas: old and new</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We chose this vanity in part because it was larger than our prior one, and has drawers. Our little old house is tight on storage, so it was important to maximize the vanity’s potential. I like the legs—it resembles furniture and lets the floor tiles show. We’d come across t</span><span class="s6">he </span><span class="s1">chrome medicine cabinet with lights at an antique shop and saved it until we were ready to start. Its curves are wonderful, as are the inner glass shelves, which are still intact. The mirror’s silvering has imperfections, but that adds to the charm.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My favorite aspects of the vintage (but still modern!) bathroom remodel are the high ceiling and floor tile. I had been planning the renovation for several years, and during that time I had collected probably 15 different floor- and wall-tile combinations. Ultimately, I was glad we took a few years to decide what we wanted and to find the right pieces. And I still love the green tub.</span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Working with the right renovation partner</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From the very beginning, our Sweeten contractor responded to the issues and questions we raised and collaborated with us in the design process. He helped us plan out what materials we needed and told us when we would need them, helping us to avoid scrambles and delays. It never felt like our input was creating a problem, or that we were being ignored.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There was no avoiding the fact that we were living in a tiny construction zone but our contractor and his crew made it as painless as possible. It was great to see the time and effort they put into clean-up each day. We’re both extremely happy with the end result.</span></p>

			<h2>An all-white kitchen can become a calming backdrop, or a stunning showstopper</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20220" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The dependable all-white kitchen color palette remains popular for the wide-ranging looks it brings to the kitchen. The clean slate of a single white hue brings visual calm when on its own. Add to that tile shape, pattern, and texture and you&#8217;ll start to see a personality emerge. It works as a supportive background when paired with gold hardware or dark wood for contrast. This classic neutral compliments modern, industrial, and every style in-between. Here, seven Sweeten kitchens show why white is the perennial choice.</p>

<h3><strong>A fresh start in an all-white kitchen</strong></h3>

<p>As new parents-to-be, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowners Tara and Brian were looking</a> for something more modern. They wanted to ditch their dated kitchen with a faulty layout. After finalizing the floor plan, the homeowners chose a simple white subway tile backsplash to ground the room. The clean tile became a cohesive backdrop for an exotic live edge walnut island countertop<span>—</span>a must-have for Tara. The dark shelves stand out and provide a pleasant contrast.</p>
<h3>A traditional kitchen goes modern</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seven months of living in their first home,</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/a-white-kitchen-sized-just-right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marc and Steve decided it was</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> time to renovate their crowded, outdated kitchen, which was once dark and claustrophobic. The homeowners wanted their kitchen to feel open and bright. To achieve this, the duo installed sleek white cabinets and countertops. The window above the sink was swapped out for a larger window letting in more natural light. A black-and-white patterned floor added a graphic urban look.</span></p>
<h3>A warm, minimalist all-white kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Elie-Chau-Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38850" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Elie-Chau-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Elie-Chau-Kitchen-01-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Elie-Chau-Kitchen-01-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Elie-Chau-Kitchen-01-1-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manhattan homeowners</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/a-galley-kitchen-gets-in-line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elie and Matt wanted to remodel</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">their washed-out gallery kitchen. Custom-made<span style="color: #333333;"> white cabinets,</span> along with a white quartz countertop and backsplash moved them in a direction that was more in line with their taste. The pop of gold hardware and large-format gray tile flooring made the kitchen feel luxurious, yet crisp and simple. Their new all-white kitchen makes Elie and Matt feel at home in the open, welcoming space.</span></p>
<h3>A simple and current all-white kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="brick wall" width="800" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-02.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a kitchen that had gone through &#8220;a hodgepodge&#8221; of renovations,</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/washington-heights-kitchen-renovation-for-a-family/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah and Eddy decided they needed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a complete change and a unifying design. Their kitchen was dark and dated. The goal was to achieve the opposite. The subway tile backsplash, grouted with dark gray, contrasted well with the open wood shelves. Keeping within the clean white look, an arabesque-patterned tile behind the stove was a nice design surprise. A neutral-toned banquette also stands out against a newly-discovered brick wall.</span></p>
<h3>Let there be light</h3>

<p>Two <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/white-walls-and-black-hardware-in-a-windowed-pre-war-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newlyweds in Manhattan</a> knew their kitchen was in need of an update before moving in. The kitchen had been worn, with dark clunky cabinets, while the dining room table made the kitchen feel cramped. After adding white cabinets with black knobs and a white quartz countertop, the space was revived. Extending the countertop underneath a window expanded the kitchen&#8217;s reach. The natural light shines through the new counter-to-ceiling windows, making the all-white kitchen gleam.</p>
<h3>Using architecture to add texture</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-loft-in-a-former-silk-warehouse-gets-a-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29280" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-loft-in-a-former-silk-warehouse-gets-a-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara and Ryan found their kitchen</a> to be functional, yet dark and musty. There was definitely room for improvement! Working around a column in the middle of the room, the couple was able to find a layout they liked. They achieved this by moving the kitchen island<span style="color: #333333;"> </span>slightly to create more room. The show-stopping feature of the room is its now dazzling white appearance. A once dated and crowded kitchen was now open and bright.</p>
<h3>All-white, with floor-to-ceiling storage</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg" alt="kitchen, kitchen island, Brooklyn kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44167" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nadia and Stephen planned to be</span></a> avid home chefs in their multigenerational townhome. But with their L-shaped kitchen, counter-space and storage were lacking, they needed some updates. The kitchen was moved to one side which made space to include an island, wraparound pantry, and dining room table. The all-white cabinets with no hardware added to the modern and streamlined look of the new bright and spacious family kitchen.<del></del></p>

<h3>Finding the right time to renovate</h3>
<p>We’ve all walked into homes where two different sets of ideas are in play. This renovation was part of a quest for cohesion. We’d established an aesthetic when we’d updated the kitchen two years before, and we were now putting in a bathroom and closet we could love. The old set of ideas included a showerhead on the long side of the bathtub and pitch-dark storage spaces. We were not sad to see them go.</p>
<div></div>

<p>We are Kate, a creative director for a women’s wellness startup, Max, a data analyst at a tech firm, and Lenny, a female Pitbull/Rat Terrier mix. We live in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in a 1926 co-op building. We’re first-time homeowners of a 610-square-foot one-bedroom apartment. We purchased in January 2016 as first-time buyers. We didn’t change the place until 2019 when we renovated the kitchen.</p>
<p>We planned to wait to continue renovating, but the combination of being home due to Covid-19 and having few opportunities to spend money meant that we wanted a nicer place and we accelerated our savings plan. We decided to go for it this year and renovate the bathroom and our closet as a single project.</p>
<h3>Swapping out the tub for a shower</h3>
<p>Remodeling the 35-square-foot bathroom was a style choice, but also one of function. In the existing room, neither the floor nor the walls were level. We hated that the shower head was in the middle of the wall on the tub’s long side. We wanted a modern stand-up shower with a glass door instead of the step-in tub and wraparound shower curtain. The closet redo made sense to tack on because of its proximity to the bathroom. We wanted to combine two small adjacent closets—one accessible from the bedroom, the other from the hallway—into a single large one. Neither closet had electrical wiring, so finding our things was a challenge. We knew we could net more storage if we merged them into one large closet.</p>

<blockquote><p>
This was easily the most challenging phase of the project, since we’d left Brooklyn on a road trip and were far away when the contractor discovered the problem. We didn’t need to worry.
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Creating a whole new bathroom layout</h3>
<p>We started in the bathroom. We rearranged the whole bathroom, so this was not a simple “rip and replace.” Moving the shower to the back wall meant relocating the toilet and reconfiguring the plumbing proved necessary. Our biggest questions were about the unknowns. In a nutshell, here’s what we learned: You can’t prepare for what’s behind a wall or under the floor. You carry out the demolition and hope to get lucky.</p>
<p>We’d decided we wanted white subway tile with a dark gray grout on the walls. The floor tiles had a distressed texture in dark gray. The vanity’s light wood finish matches our kitchen cabinets, and it offers tons of storage even though it’s only a 24-inch unit. The toilet search was more challenging than expected since we had specific size requirements, but eventually, we found one we liked.</p>
<h3>The contractor handles the discovery under the subfloor</h3>
<p>We’d heard plenty of nightmares about people moving plumbing in New York City bathrooms and hoped our fate might be different, but it wasn’t. Having completed most of the demolition, the contractors lifted the floor tile. Beneath the visible layer, they discovered two additional layers of tile. Once the subfloor was exposed, it was clear it had been compromised, both by years of trapped moisture and the weight of those three tile layers.</p>

<p>The co-op&#8217;s engineer brought onsite recommended pouring a new concrete slab, which added expense and impacted our schedule. This was easily the most challenging phase of the project since we’d left Brooklyn on a road trip and were far away when the contractor discovered the problem. We didn’t need to worry. Our contractor worked with the building’s engineer to pour the new slab to the required specifications.</p>
<h3>Smooth communication with their contractor</h3>
<p>Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors provided us with updates via an online project-management tool that <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped with communication throughout the job</a>. The team used the tool to share photo and video updates. It helped to keep everyone in sync and organized. That platform really streamlined the conversation regarding every aspect of the job. The bathroom came together exactly as we’d hoped. We’re thrilled with the new storage, including an inset bottle nook in the shower. And the rain showerhead combined with our building’s incredible water pressure makes for an immersive experience every morning.</p>
<h3>Combining closets for a larger one</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-remodel-your-closet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded bedroom closet</a> came next. The contractors removed the wall separating the two smaller closets in order to merge them; we kept the door on the bedroom side. I love being able to see things in the closet, thanks to the increased space, and the addition of wiring let us install good lighting. For the shelving, we took a hybrid approach, buying all of the parts separately. The white shelves are typical closet shelves, but the racks are meant for garage storage. We can finally find our clothes!</p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="walk-in-closet-with-shelves" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="small custom walk-in closet storage with shelves after renovation" width="800" height="1200" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51190" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>This closet hack would also mean addressing the hallway with trim and paint. On that side, the contractors closed the door opening and painted the wall, where we later created a gallery wall for art and photos. The previous door trim was missing chunks of wood (likely from people moving big objects in/out of rooms and banging into the door frame.) It had also been painted a million times and was generally an eyesore. We knew replacing the door and window trim would go a long way towards refreshing the space. The red light fixture provides a nice pop of color.</p>

<h3>Their Sweeten contractors: the right renovation partners</h3>
<p>This was a much larger project than we thought we’d be taking on this year, but it worked out beautifully. Our Sweeten contractors were transparent about billing, supplying us with perfectly itemized invoices. They were terrific problem solvers, with elegant design sense and ideas that enhanced our final results. We love our new apartment!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">These 7 modern bathroom designs by Sweeten homeowners show off a wide range of inspiration</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47426 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23.jpg" alt="A modern loft bathroom with white marble and black fixtures" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #76808f;">Modern bathroom designs can be sleek or warm. (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #76808f;"><span class="s3">Lexi&#8217;s minimalist bathroom renovation</span></a>.</span></p>
<h3>A fresh version of modern</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you think of a modern classic bathroom, images of white tile accented with contemporary fixtures come to mind. This vision is true but the design palette can also stretch beyond that. Texture, tone, shape, and color all contribute to the look for an updated definition. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern can fit in a variety of styles, including traditional, minimalist, or farmhouse. </span><span class="s1">Here, a look at seven different Sweeten renovations proving a modern classic bathroom is in the eye of the beholder. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Sweeten</span><span class="s1"> matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Tactile finishes deliver a modern bathroom design</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46812 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-12.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1">Actress Jaime Ray Newman and partner Guy Nattiv worked with two designers and their Sweeten contractor to form a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-of-a-kind look for their remodel</a>. In their master bathroom, they chose multiple unique handmade tiles for the walls and floors. Also, a light wood vanity was a natural material that anchored the whole space. As a result, the couple’s choices proved that light-color tile with texture and shape could bring just the right amount of subtle drama to a modern bathroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Modern bathroom with mixed finishes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="black-and-white-bathroom-floor-tiles" class="alignnone wp-image-41691 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1">Designing <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their bathroom remodel</a> with floor-to-ceiling white subway tile gave Tina and Andrew a classic base to build on. What they added to it brought personality and dimension. A vintage-style exposed shower fixture shows what’s old is new again. The mixing of finishes—brass and chrome—is a popular trend. For extra storage, a double-wide medicine cabinet extends past the custom blue vanity for some asymmetry. Lastly, a shower curtain textile with a pattern and tassel trim is the final soft touch.</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">A soft side to modern</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4"><img decoding="async" title="subway-tiles-blue-paint-bathroom-walls" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset18.jpg" alt="wood veneer custom cabinets with glass shower door and white vessel sink on floating cabinet after renovation " width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-33433 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset18-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset18-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1">Melissa’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/this-couples-built-ins-just-keep-on-giving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">500-square-foot apartment</a> went through clever design changes for her and her partner to live comfortably. Their bathroom, which barely had room to turn around in, borrowed square footage from the bedroom next door. The couple’s design plan demonstrates that a modern vibe can have a softer side. The cool stone-look tile pulls you in with help from natural light streaming in. Also, soft curves in the drop-in sink and fixtures add to the ambiance. Wood tones always bring in warmth when a space needs it. Here&#8217;s one more modern idea: a built-in cabinet inside the shower is tucked between a beam and shower wall for covered storage!</p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A clean<span>—</span>but not overly simple<span>—</span>aesthetic</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09.jpg" alt="A modern bathroom design of Moroccan tile floor and subway tile shower" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone wp-image-48734 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sisters <span class="s3">Nicole and Missy</span> turned to Sweeten to begin their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/a-sibling-duo-renovates-an-arlington-basement-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arlington bathroom renovation</a>. Nicole originally thought she wanted a simple and clean white bathroom. However, as the project unfolded, she realized she wanted more personality in the design thanks to her Sweeten contractor&#8217;s suggestions. The sliding barn shower door and white-washed oak vanity came in to complete this modern bathroom design. </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Black matte finish on a clean canvas</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47426 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23.jpg" alt="A modern loft bathroom with marble stone and black fixtures" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This Manhattan couple went with a minimalist white color scheme for <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Greenwich Village</a> modern <span class="s3">bathroom design.</span> Their Sweeten contractor installed a sleek vanity characterized by linear silhouettes and a geometric shower niche. A black matte faucet was installed on the wall, which boosts the contemporary factor. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Gray grout offsets modern gold touches</span></h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For <span class="s3">Amy and Kevin’s </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s3">LA bathroom renovation,</span></a> they, like many other renovators, chose classic subway tile. However, they tweaked the look by using gray grout. (Gray is a great choice as it is both classic and contemporary at the same time.) They also selected a large-format gray tile for the floor, which grounded the room. To pull in a traditional aesthetic, the couple put in a 30-inch vanity in a natural wood tone. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A modern bathroom design mixes in classic fixtures</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46861 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04.jpg" alt="A modern Chicago bathroom with gray walls, stone tile and double vanity sink" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span><span class="s2">Leah and Brian</span><span class="s1"> worked with a Sweeten contractor to update their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago loft’s bathroom</a>. They went with antique brass for the finishes—as seen in the pendant light, shower head, and faucet—to give it a classic look. To add in a modern vibe, they chose porcelain tile in a gloss finish for the walls. Matte finish tiles laid in a herringbone pattern on the shower floor complete the look.</span></p>

			<h2>In the bathroom, white subway tile is the perfect backdrop for classic or contemporary looks</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24008 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="White bathroom with black matte fixtures" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder why more and more homeowners are using white subway tile in a bathroom. Its texture ranges from smooth and beveled to a handmade feel, while its bright appearance can contrast nicely with many color palettes. They are simple yet versatile pieces that give these seven Sweeten bathroom renovations a polished and modern look, unique to each homeowner.</p>
<p>Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</p>
<h3>A classic New York look</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18.jpg" alt="black and white bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-48624 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">California transplants, Jeremy and Chris, landed their first apartment in Manhattan’s Hudson Yards neighborhood. As an ode to old New York, their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/hudson-yards-renovation-updates-foyer-kitchen-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">black and white bathroom</a> featured subway tile and a hex floor tile. Design tip: Thin trim in black runs through the subway tile giving the large canvas some interest.</p>
<h3>White subway tile in a bathroom as a focal point</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29.jpg" alt="gray bathroom floor tiles and white floating vanity with mirror and toilet and bathtub and floor to ceiling wall tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51516" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Sweeten homeowners Terri and Brett, both architects, added a little luxe to their guest bathroom. <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/when-pros-design-their-family-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marble subway tile</a> in a variety of whites and shades of gray gives the space a lot of movement. The rest of the materials are streamlined and simple allowing the tile to be the bathroom’s main feature.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>A soft look in light gray</h3>

She posted her <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/eclectic-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation on Sweeten</a>, which included her full bathroom. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She worked with her Sweeten contractor to select pieces that would match the vintage, mid-century modern, Afrocentrist, brass, and natural wood style that she envisioned. With so many different pieces and styles being added, she looked for simple tiling as a backdrop. Her solution: off-white marble-honed subway tiles.</span></p>
<h3>White subway tiles: elongated and elegant</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25520 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-13.jpg" alt="Image of a white bathroom with subway tile and walk-in shower" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-13-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nazli and Larry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> undertook a gut renovation on their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooklyn brownstone</a> in the Bedford Historic District. They wanted to transform the space into a home that matched the needs and personality of their family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Nazli’s mom was a regular visitor, they renovated the guest bathroom to be warm and welcoming. One of Nazli’s favorite things about the guest bath is the white subway tiles that were added to the shower walls: “I love these subway tiles. They are just varied enough to give them a real handmade look rather than the flat subway tiles we usually see.” Nazli says her only regret is not using them in more spots throughout the house.</span></p>
<h3>Subway tiles in upward mobility</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/bath-gets-graphic-tile/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22745 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Image of a bathroom with white subway tile in a herringbone pattern" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Janna and her family</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gutted their crowded and <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/bath-gets-graphic-tile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crumbling bathroom</a> in Morningside Heights, Manhattan. One of the main reasons for the renovation was a seven-foot tub that consumed most of the space. Limited space left little storage and a messy bathroom. On top of that, the fixtures were all old and in need of an upgrade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the remodel, she still had an appreciation for the pre-war building and wanted to maintain that feel. Janna carefully selected the materials to achieve a refreshed and spacious bathroom, without compromising the pre-war aesthetic. Janna’s first tile choice cost $12,000, something that was not in her budget. Instead, she chose a white subway tile laid out in a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> jaunty vertical herringbone design. The pattern added an interesting element to the bathroom in the industrial look she was looking for. </span></p>
<h3>Bevel white subway tiles</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="double vanity sink in bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24007" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-03-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p>A bathroom leak forced Sweeten homeowners Katie and Lance to renovate. They took this opportunity to redo the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/bathroom-remodel-uber-chic-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom tile design</a> for a refined and elegant aesthetic, while still maintaining a budget. To do so, they chose bevel white subway tiles for their walls and the tub exterior.</p>
<h3>Boho vibes with salvage and wood</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22968 size-large" title="Prospect Heights bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated bathroom with white subway tile and clawfoot tub" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>An upstairs leak ruined the ceiling of his 1940’s era co-op bathroom, prompting architect Brian Kaplan to renovate. So, he <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/an-architect-drafts-a-travel-inspired-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned to Sweeten</a> for help to get it done.</p>
<p>For inspiration, Brian looked to the luxurious spaces he had seen while traveling abroad on business. The result: a bathroom mixed with vintage charm and modern luxury. Brian chose floor-to-ceiling classic white subway tiles in the bathroom. It complements the blue accent pieces for an old-world feel.</p>

<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowners Sarah and Eddy</span></em></p>
<h3>Creating unity within a floorplan</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah, a managing director at an international nonprofit, WaterAid, and her husband, Eddy, a medical consultant, thought their co-op in Washington Heights, New York, was ideal for raising their two daughters. They loved the location, near Fort Tryon Park, and the design aesthetic of their 1939 Art Deco building. The problem? An outdated kitchen that had been (seemingly) randomly renovated over the years, with one section updated at a time. It resulted in what Sarah called a “hodgepodge” layout and design. </span></p>
<div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall, it was dark and dated,” said Sarah. “The cabinets seemed to be original, but we don’t know that for a fact, but they sure looked like it.” The couple also desperately needed more counter space. “There was more space for dining than food prep,” commented Sarah.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19331-SarahD-Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="Galley kitchen with white marble and tile backsplash and wood floors" width="800" height="1200" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52417" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19331-SarahD-Kitchen-03.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19331-SarahD-Kitchen-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19331-SarahD-Kitchen-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

<h3>Finding an aesthetic to compliment the room</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, there were two windows in the kitchen. Cabinets completely blocked one window, so it wasn&#8217;t functional. By rearranging the layout, the homeowners were able to expose the window, adding more natural light to the updated kitchen</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="subway-wall-tiles-with-floating-shelves"  class="alignnone wp-image-44438 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with subway tiles on walls and marble countertop with farmhouse sink and stainless steel appliances and floating wooden shelves after renovation" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-04.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm was amazing! Both our designer, Ally, and our project manager, Petar, were like on-call doctors,” said Sarah. “They helped me with decision-making around all things—from what size appliances to buy to practical storage ideas.” Sarah and Eddy decided to keep the original floors to give a nod to the origins of the building. The kitchen received new cabinets, countertops, and appliances.</span></p>

<h3>Using the houses original walls</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they gutted the kitchen, they found beautiful brick walls hiding behind the sheetrock. The brick became a focal point behind a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/banquettes-seating-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newly added banquette</a> bringing a new texture to their streamlined, all-white kitchen. “The girls love to sit at the banquette and read while eating,” said Sarah. &#8220;And with an outlet installed in the banquette, it&#8217;s become a cozy work-from-home space during the pandemic.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, they kept the design simple and current with white cabinets and Calacatta countertops. Gray grout in the subway tile and the reclaimed wood floating shelves add contrast and personality.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="subway-wall-tiles-with-floating-shelves"  class="alignnone wp-image-44436 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-08.jpg" alt="white subway tiles on walls with floating wooden shelves and marble countertop after renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-08.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<h3>Overcoming unplanned obstacles</h3>
<p>Necessary plumbing behind the kitchen sink left Sarah and Eddy with less cabinet depth to work with. As a result, they had to install a smaller than usual sink. Fortunately, in a clever workaround, to allow the sink to maximize the counter depth, the faucet was set off to the side.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49327 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-09.jpg" alt="Image of an offset kitchen faucet" width="800" height="1200" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-09.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;We love literally everything about our new kitchen,” said Sarah. “The countertops, the pantry, the counter-depth fridge&#8230;even the vent hood!”</p>

</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Michele</i></span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Getting excited to renovate</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I lead a digital product design team for a large San Francisco-based company. I’ve lived in this apartment for a little over a decade, and I had been meaning to renovate my bathroom since I moved in, but I always found a reason not to. The bath hadn’t had an upgrade since the building’s 1980s conversion to co-op! The pedestal sink wasn’t fully attached to the wall, the tub tiles were loosening, and the glass tile floor, which a previous owner had painted, was flaking.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">My apartment is on the top floor of a 1910s five-story building, and it suffered damage during a co-op-sponsored roof renovation a couple of years back. When the building’s contractor completed the repairs, I got excited about renovating. My recently acquired work-from-home job gave me more incentive. I’d updated my home office to suit the remote role, but experiencing my out-of-date bathroom all day, every day, prompted me to get planning.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Finding inspiration from other renovators</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I spent so much time on Sweeten, reading this blog, and looking at other people’s projects! It was a tremendous help seeing what other people had done. </span><span class="s5">I had strong ideas about how I wanted to proceed, but I needed help turning them into particular products, finishes, and colors.</span> <span class="s1">Sweeten provided me with a range of contractors and design-build firms who gave me numerous options. I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5415#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose my Sweeten contractor</a> because his ideas matched mine.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I’d done advance planning for the bathroom and had a clear idea of what I wanted: a floating vanity, a drop-in tub, oversized subway tile, and dramatic tile flooring. I was attracted to images of gray kitchens and bathrooms with boldly patterned floors. I envisioned something that was calm and streamlined, to make the space feel bigger and take advantage of the high ceiling. My apartment is modern and open. I wanted the bath and kitchen to feel integrated, rather than set apart from the rest of the space.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47057" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03.jpg" alt="pattern tile bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">The contractors were great at explaining problems long-distance: I’ll never forget the crew piling on a conference call about my formerly crooked bathroom wall&#8230;</span></p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A new dishwasher becomes a full kitchen remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, my plan had been to simply install a new dishwasher. Then it was suggested that a pantry could be added in the then-unused space at the kitchen’s entrance. The original kitchen plan I had posted to Sweeten was of a smaller scope, but after meeting them, I asked the contractors to submit follow-up <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bids for a full kitchen remodel</a>.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-47056 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, I worked with my contractor to come up with a plan. I put together the light and dark gray cabinets with chrome handles and found a quartz countertop flecked with both colors. I picked the same flooring that the designer had used in their showroom.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01.jpg" alt="open shelving kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-47055 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05.jpg" alt="blue kitchen cabinetry" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-47059 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Transforming the bathroom wasn’t so hard. I saw a tile floor I liked in the sale listing of another apartment in my building and tracked it down. Finding a bathtub that would fit the small space was a challenge, but we did. (The white tub looked yellow next to the tile, so we had it reglazed.) Because of pipes in the wall, we couldn’t create storage niches in the shower, so the team extended the interior windowsill with a white quartz surface material—a shampoo perch. The floating sink is mounted a bit higher than standard because I’m tall.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A timely business trip</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The project’s biggest challenge was also something of a stroke of luck: My boss asked me to travel from New York to San Francisco, starting the day demolition began. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I stayed for almost three weeks</a>. While I was away, the Sweeten construction team kept me posted and sent pictures daily. The contractor was great at explaining problems long-distance: I’ll never forget the crew piling on a conference call about my formerly crooked bathroom wall while I waited outside an executive office at work!</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Instead of hiring a project manager, I worked as my own. I had spreadsheets for how much had been spent versus budgeted. I tracked what had been ordered, shipped, and delivered. I’m not that organized, but I turned into a full-on spreadsheet ninja. It kept me from panicking.</span></p>
<div><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-47060 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></div>
<h3 class="p5">Finishing the bathroom and kitchen renovation during COVID-19</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">By the time COVID-19 hit and the lockdown was ordered, we were 95 percent done. We had to wait for the lockdown to lift and for my building to let the crew return, clearly articulating when they would arrive, and wearing masks as required.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Eventually, we finished. After expanding my renovation’s scope, I spent significantly more than I originally intended to—close to $100,000 all told, but that includes fully updated plumbing and new floors in both rooms. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I have enough storage space in the kitchen and bathroom that nothing falls out when I open a cabinet! I love cooking; I’ve got a lot of ingredients and equipment, and it’s so nice not to feel like I’m overstuffing every corner. Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment! I’m also enjoying the dishwasher. I love the way the kitchen tile feels under my feet, and how the rooms are designed for me, with my interests and needs—even my career—in mind. That customization is the greatest luxury of the whole thing.</span></p>

<h3>A home search is serendipitous</h3>
<p>We were living in a one-bedroom apartment on the third floor for almost a year when an opportunity came knocking. Tina’s father, who used to be the superintendent in the building, heard about this apartment through the grapevine. The two-bedroom, one-bath with an eat-in kitchen on the ground floor had been occupied by the same owner for decades. The apartment hadn’t yet been listed, so we didn’t know what to expect. As we eagerly walked in, it became clear that it needed a lot of TLC.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41734 size-full" title="portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-21.jpg" alt="home remodel" width="1856" height="2784" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-21.jpg 1856w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-21-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-21-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1856px) 100vw, 1856px" /></a></p>
<p>Its dimensions were a little over 900 square feet. We saw plenty of potential, but the original layout was partitioned and closed-off. The dated 1970s finishes and dark saturated colors throughout made the space feel extremely dark and cavernous. It was certainly a fixer-upper, but we agreed it was worth taking on and jumped in feet first.</p>
<div></div>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41695 size-full" title="living room and dining space" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-10.jpg" alt="living room and dining space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>A successful general contractor match</h3>
<p>Living in the same building, we could easily visit the space for measurements, planning, and the actual renovation. Enter <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>. After interviewing nearly ten lackluster contractors, we discovered Sweeten and signed up immediately. Their contractors were a godsend, very professional, and responsive. We got an estimate the same day when others would take days or just ghost us completely. And they took the time to answer all our questions and negotiate prices before they were even hired. Choosing a contractor was probably one of the most stressful and time-consuming parts of the renovation process.</p>
<h3>Planning a coastal look</h3>
<p>Our vision was to make the space airy, bright, and modern while still complementing the building’s prewar style. Tina, a designer by trade, used her skills to sketch layouts, create mood boards, and research finishes. French bistros, Vermont farmhouses, and Hampton beach bungalows were inspirations. The apartment was grounded in light neutrals with navy blue and oak wood accents for a coastal look. We loved the clean lines and texture of the shiplap, board and batten, and exposed brick. Touches of brass and Carrara marble helped warm up and elevate the space.</p>

To brighten the space further, we doused every surface with white paint and installed French doors to all the bedrooms. The carpets were removed to reveal the original 1930s hardwood floors. To our relief, the parquet still had plenty of life left in them. We went with a clear matte finish to give it a natural look and feel.</p>
<h3>More natural light in the living room</h3>
<p>The windows in the living room and spare room were recessed nearly a foot into the wall which blocked a lot of light from coming in. Exposing the brick on these walls would open things up. Our contractor built beautiful custom window frames to finish the windows off. We used a natural limestone paint to whitewash the brick for an aged look.</p>

<h3>A kitchen opens up—partially</h3>
<p>We took the plunge and opened up half the kitchen into what would become the living room—the brightest space in the apartment. It also gave back a nice chunk of square footage previously wasted with an awkwardly-curved wall. A small linen closet was removed to fit a large countertop between the kitchen and living room.</p>

<p>As a family that loves to entertain and cook together, we wanted a functional space with a lot of storage. Because kitchens take up a large portion of a renovation budget, we tried to be clever and save where we could. Instead of custom cabinets, we went with Ikea but purchased the cabinet doors from a company that specializes in stylish and modern cabinetry for Ikea kitchen systems.</p>

Marble tiles are more affordable than a marble slab (and a lot less maintenance). All of our state-of-the-art appliances were purchased at an outlet in Long Island where appliances were like-new floor samples. If you have the time and patience to hunt for deals, it can really save you a lot in the long run. We did splurge on the “jewelry” of the kitchen—the faucet and cabinet hardware. These little details make a huge difference.</p>

<h3>Details make a difference</h3>
<p>The bedroom with two large closets became the master bedroom. Two closets were combined into one big walk-in closet. We painted the room white and added board and batten paneling on one wall for dimension. The double french doors our contractor installed (also in the spare room) were our favorite part of the room. It gave the space a grand look and let so much natural light come through.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41691 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>The bathroom was on the smaller side and didn’t see a need to sacrifice any space to expand it. We included some fun touches, like a brass light fixture (plus dimmer switch) and a vintage-style exposed shower body. The extra-wide medicine cabinet and custom-built vanity helped make efficient use of limited storage.</p>

<h3>Experiencing the renovation process</h3>
<p>Our contractor and his team deserve a lot of credit for their hard work and patience with us. Everybody should know that these jobs are never simple. Scheduling can get tricky.</p>
<p>Being detail-oriented and working with a contractor you can communicate with were really important to us. Our Sweeten contractor had no problem emailing back and forth about even the smallest detail. Bounce your wildest ideas off of the professionals; that is what they are there for.</p>
<p>One thing we would caution is the amount of work, if any, you decide to take on yourself. To keep the budget under control we decided to paint and do some other finishes ourselves. We saved thousands of dollars but doing all that work when we both have full-time jobs was exhausting.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41706 size-full" title="dresser" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-17.jpg" alt="dresser" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-17-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-17-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Our new home really feels like a dream come true, and we feel very fortunate to call it our own. It was no cakewalk, but we had a blast every step of the way. Coming after work and seeing the progress made was so exciting. The hope and promise of creating a space all your own, to us, is what renovations are all about. We hope our fellow renovators find it as <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rewarding of an experience</a> as we did.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Tina and Andrew, for sharing how your new home came together!</em></p>

Ditch a clunky layout. Add a kitchen island. And do it before the baby arrives. Those were Tara and Brian’s four main renovation goals after they bought a two-bedroom co-op (with a small office space) in Park Slope, Brooklyn. The prewar apartment was an upgrade in space and number of bedrooms from their previous rental as the couple prepared to start a family.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40338 mt-24 size-full" title="family portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40323 size-full" title="kitchen before renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01.jpg" alt="kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40332 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">It’s a shallow pantry, but it is enormously useful.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>However, it was outdated. Oak cabinets in the kitchen and patterned tiles in the bathroom, all from the &#8217;90s, made the room feel old. A kitchen peninsula awkwardly dissected the eating area and living room. The fridge took up prime real estate, blocking light from the apartment’s rear. “The previous owners had lived there for eight years and hadn’t really updated it,” Tara said. They decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted contractors, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-101/meet-the-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose a general contractor.</a></p>
<p>The couple decided to do most of the renovation before moving in so Tara, who was pregnant at the time, wouldn’t inhale any dust. Once the water was connected and the messy work complete, Brian and Tara took up residence while their contractor worked around them.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40337 size-full" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40326 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen storage and integrated refrigerator" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02.jpg" alt="kitchen storage and integrated refrigerator" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>For Tara, adding that <span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> island was non-negotiable and it turned out to be one of the crowning glories of the renovation. Their contractor had a reclaimed wood supplier in Pennsylvania and the couple picked out a big slab of walnut. They went for a rustic look, leaving two sides with a live edge and enhanced the wood’s cherry red tone with a lacquer. “<span style="color: #333333;">I remember when I was a kid, the kitchen island was the center of existence,” she said, adding that now when they have friends over, that still proves true.</span></p>
<p>Their contractor suggested a workaround for the refrigerator. The area already had three big clunky closets across from the main kitchen. Why not match those closets to the new cabinets in the kitchen and hide the fridge in there? It turned into a perfect solution that helped the flow of space between the living room, kitchen and the back of the apartment.</p>

The new kitchen layout had a few feet of wall space that wasn’t serving any purpose other than be covered in the white subway tiles Brian and Tara picked for their backsplash. The contractor saw the potential for a small pantry. When it’s shut, it looks like a tiled wall. But pop the magnetic doors open, and a 10-inch deep cabinet is revealed. “<span style="color: #333333;">It’s a shallow pantry, but it is enormously useful,</span>” said Tara. “Our friends think it is so cool.”</p>
<p>To create a sense of openness in the kitchen, Tara and Brian ditched the cabinets above the counter <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-shelves-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in favor of open shelving</a>. Their contractor used the walnut from the new kitchen island to create the shelving. The red proved the perfect accent of color and texture to the couple’s color palette of black and white.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQtbfhBsVrk&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="behind-the-video-image" class="alignnone wp-image-40850 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-EdAlicia.jpg" alt="image of behind the reno video" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-EdAlicia.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-EdAlicia-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-EdAlicia-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<p>Sticking closely to that color scheme, Tara wanted a darker stain with a matte finish on the wood floors. Brian thought it needed more gloss. “We spent a lot of time figuring out what stain to use,” Tara said. “My husband eventually came around.”</p>

Of everything in the renovation, making a decision on what <span style="color: #333333;">bathroom</span> faucets to install took the most time. Tara wanted something modern and functional. Brian had a strong view that it should have one handle instead of two. In the end, they found something “that we both didn’t hate,” Tara said.</p>
<p>She also felt strongly in favor of a glass partition rather than a shower curtain, “to make the space look bigger.” Brian pointed out the difficulties of maneuvering around a partial glass barrier when bathing their soon-to-arrive infant. To get on the same page on the glass, Tara volunteered to take the lead on baby bathing responsibilities. “At the moment she is still getting washed in the kitchen sink because it is so big,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40330 size-full" title="bathroom vanity" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-06.jpg" alt="bathroom vanity" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40329 size-full" title="matte black shower fixtures" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-05.jpg" alt="matte black shower fixtures" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">If we thought creatively, we could make the most of all the space that would otherwise have gone unused.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The renovation hit a snag when their general contractor uncovered some serious water damage to the bathroom flooring. The couple had planned on keeping the original bathtub since they thought it was in pretty good shape. This new discovery meant they needed a new one. On the bright side, it gave Tara the chance to cross something off her “want” list: a bath with a tiled side.  “<span style="color: #333333;">Our contractor was very upfront with what was needed and what the cost would be,” Tara said, of the mid-project pivot. “He gave us options of what to do about it.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40331 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07.jpg" alt="study" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />The walnut wood turned into the gift that kept giving. After completing the kitchen, their contractor used the remainder to create three small shelves in the bathroom. With some wood still unused, he carved up more shelves for the <span style="color: #333333;">office</span>.</p>
<p>The renovation took three months to complete. During the project, Brian and Tara communicated often with their Sweeten contractor via text message and in person. “He was so great because we would text with him and he would keep us up-to-date even on minor details,” Tara said.</p>
<p>The couple also learned the art of compromise during the process. “Brian had to remind me of what was practical even if I really wanted something,” Tara said. But at the same time, don’t be afraid to get creative, she advised. The secret pantry behind a tiled wall and walnut shelving in the bathroom are two examples of making inspired decisions on the go. “<span style="color: #333333;">We realized if we thought creatively,” said Tara, “we could make the most of all the space that would otherwise have gone unused.”</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: After moving from an apartment in Kensington, Brooklyn, to a brownstone in Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, Christina and Aaron were ready to renovate their “new” kitchen. Located in a 2,600-square-foot brownstone originally built in 1901, the cook space was definitely showing its age. The multi-color cabinets and floors were falling apart and the appliances were also outdated. Aaron, a director of child programming, and Christina, a registered nurse, wanted a clean and contemporary kitchen better suited for their family of three (including their son Maverick). The couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/31654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to Sweeten and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple chose ceiling-high custom cabinets, with the bottom units painted in a rich navy and the uppers in white. Aside from the refrigerator and cabinets above, they left one wall open to include a small table and two chairs next to a big window. Just outside the kitchen and right off their separate dining room, they converted part of the hallway into an extra pantry area. The floating shelves match the ones used in the far end of the kitchen built from reclaimed wood from <a href="https://www.bigreuse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Reuse</a>.</span></p>

From the beginning, he provided a detailed plan outlining the timeline, a list of needed materials, and recommended businesses and suppliers. Sweeten Client Services also checked in on the project status and contractor performance to ensure the couple was happy with the progress.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest challenges we faced with this project were the unexpected discoveries that would often add on to the workload and adjust the timeline of the project, such as the discovery that the floor needed to be re-leveled before tiling,” Aaron said. The electrical also needed to be updated to power the new appliances and the ceiling height had to be adjusted due to pre-existing damage. If you’re renovating an older home, Aaron strongly advises leaving plenty of room wiggle room in your budget because during demolition, issues that weren’t noticeable before can come to the surface.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Cooking has become so much easier and enjoyable thanks to their new counter space and the bigger stove.</span></p>

<h3>Falling for a new Manhattan neighborhood</h3>
<p>Sonali, a consultant, and Shalaj, an investment banker, were initially unsure about their move to the Financial District in Manhattan, but soon found themselves falling in love with the neighborhood. “We enjoy going on long walks along the river and just exploring the shops and restaurants in the area,” Sonali said. One night, while walking their cocker spaniel, Tyson, the couple discovered the Southbridge Towers complex, which had recently been privatized. Although they hadn’t considered buying before, the building piqued their curiosity. They started going to open houses and putting in their bids but were outbid several times before finally being accepted for a 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom co-op. “Truth be told, we were not expecting our offer to get accepted!” Sonali said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36162 size-chrono" title="floor-plan-design-changes" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-Floorplan-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plan sketch of rooms before and after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-Floorplan-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-Floorplan-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-Floorplan-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-Floorplan.jpg 1084w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the two settled into their new roles as homeowners, they said, “reality hit” and they realized the apartment (with its original &#8217;70s design) would need a complete overhaul: a gut renovation. “We had no idea where to start,” Sonali said. Luckily, that’s when they found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post their Financial District renovation</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“We needed to renovate the entire apartment, including the removal of the original popcorn ceiling. We wanted a contractor who would not only handle all aspects of the renovation but also fit within our tight budget and schedule,” she said. The project would also include knocking down walls, which required permits from both their building and the city. They were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a> who was comfortable with their project scope and timeline.</p>

<h3>Expanding the kitchen, and compromising along the way</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sonali and Shalaj agreed that the most important change to tackle would be opening up the <span style="color: #000000;">kitchen</span>. “We both enjoy cooking and having friends over, so we knew we would be spending a lot of time in there,” Sonali said. They decided to remove a kitchen wall to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-plan-living-when-lounging-meets-dining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open the space</a> into the living room and make the whole apartment feel less cramped. They went with a white-on-white design, with white cabinets, a white subway tile backsplash, and white quartz countertops throughout (which Sonali called “exquisite”).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of installing a microwave over the gas range, they opted for a drawer-style instead. &#8220;It reminded Shalaj of years of renting!&#8221; Sonali said. Another item they really wanted was a Wolf gas range. &#8220;It was way beyond our stove budget, but when our contractor told us about a discounted floor model, we decided to splurge on it,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35881 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06-723x482.jpg" alt="Financial District, renovation, apartment renovation, home, design, construction" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An unexpected delight in the kitchen was the under-cabinet LED lights with dimmers, suggested by the contractor, which both added charm and accentuated the white subway tile backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the process, the couple found they had to compromise on certain elements. For example, because of the location of the gas line, they couldn’t move the stove away from the peninsula as originally planned. Sonali found the silver lining, though: “We like that the stove is in the peninsula now because it allows us to cook and interact with guests when we have them over!” They spent most of their effort and money on the kitchen. “We have not regretted any of our decisions yet,” she said.</p>

<h3>Adding closet space to the co-op</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next renovation priority was to double the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closet space</a> in the<span style="color: #000000;"> master bedroom by taking the adjacent guest bedroom&#8217;s closet; the second bedroom got a new one of its own built. “In our last rental, Shalaj was relegated</span> to the living room closet, so having enough storage space in the master bedroom was pretty high on his list of priorities,” Sonali explained. Shalaj wanted to install lights in their custom closets, but once they realized this addition would add thousands of dollars to their renovation costs, they decided to buy battery-operated lights instead.</p>

<h3>A bathroom refresh &amp; pet-friendly wooden flooring</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple decided to close up the living room closet and have it open inside the <span style="color: #000000;">bathroom</span>. This change added <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> to the bathroom and got rid of wasted space in the hallway. Like the kitchen, the bathroom was also mostly white. To add contrast and character, they installed black hexagonal floor tile. “We get complimented on it a lot!” Sonali said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the rest of the apartment, the contractor installed wide-plank, oak hardwood floors. Sonali described the color as “not too dark, not too light” and loves that it blends with Tyson’s fur—something relatable to any pet owner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-selecting-and-ordering-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">choosing materials</a>, Sonali said that the couple had no idea how many choices there would be or how much it could end up costing. That’s where their contractor came in: “To help us work through our sticker shock, our contractor had carefully built a list of items in three categories (budget, standard, and high-end) and supplied samples, to the extent possible. From there, our job was mostly to choose one of the three options provided, which made life so much easier for us,” she said.</p>

<h3>Lessons learned from the Financial District renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most stressful moment of the renovation came a week before the couple was supposed to move into their new apartment. None of the appliances had been installed, there was paper all over the floor, and the electrical work had not yet been started. Since they were unable to stay in their old apartment, they worried they might not have anywhere to go. The Sweeten contractor reassured them the process wasn’t very far behind schedule, and sure enough, they were able to move in on time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Our contractor took great control of the project, from getting building approval to ensuring that we could meet the move-in deadline.” She added, “We had heard horror stories about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how long renovations</a> can take, but working with an experienced and responsible contractor makes the process much smoother.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple’s advice to new renovators? “A friend of ours had advised us to set aside a 30% buffer on top of our budget. The advice came in handy as that was almost exactly the amount we went over by.” Extra costs included a few items outside the original scope such as replacing the AC unit and also spending more on kitchen materials than had been initially planned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sonali said, &#8220;We love our new space and feel lucky to find a home in our favorite neighborhood and to add our personal touch to the layout and materials.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: A <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14780#before" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rip-and-replace bathroom</a> in Yorkville, Manhattan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Deborah purchased this 1-bed, 1-bath co-op apartment and within a year, she could no longer live with the old, grimy tiles and outdated look, so she turned to Sweeten. Her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3531#references" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten design-build firm</a> went to work freshening up the space (she redid her kitchen as well; see results <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-pretty-entry-for-a-classic-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). The goal was to modernize the small space with new fixtures and finishes while retaining the original footprint. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t allowed to expand the existing footprint,&#8221; says Deborah, &#8220;because my co-op wouldn&#8217;t allow a &#8216;wet space-over-dry-space&#8217; rule.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they went to demo the bathroom, the contractor discovered that the waste lines were all sunk into the floor, rather than the walls, where they are usually found. They had to redo them all, which added an additional week to the project for inspections and approvals and an extra cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="off-white-bathroom-with-glass-door" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49097 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="Off white bathroom with glass door to tub and white vanity with oval sink after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: A calm color palette provides a serene spot to get ready for the day. White subway tile and a subtle gray paint on the walls are paired with a modern white floating <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> with custom pull-out drawers, which provides more accessible and usable space than traditional doors. The vanity, with ample storage, was a suggestion by her contractor and &#8220;meant I didn&#8217;t need a bulky medicine cabinet,&#8221; said Deborah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A metal grille cover was created for the radiator. A combination of white-plank <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-shelving-bathrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open shelving</a> and a glass shelf above the toilet provide plenty of display space for small toiletries. The Sweeten contractor also came up with the idea to add the paneling on the side of the bathtub for a classic look, as well as framing the window in white Thassos marble molding. Topped off with a frameless shower enclosure, the space is functional and beautiful, a major improvement from its predecessor. &#8220;My contractor was excellent with design,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am thrilled with my new bathroom.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Everyone loves a window in the bathroom, and the Sweeten contractor was sure to frame this one with a waterproof application that would keep the space watertight for years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Finally, a happy home after bumps and delays</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>For a dozen years, Tara and Mike lived in a tiny studio apartment on the Upper West Side. A move uptown, to the Grand Concourse Historic District of the Bronx, landed them in a much larger home in a 1930s co-op building. In 2015, they moved in and up against no deadlines to renovate, carefully thought through the changes they wanted to make and assembled photos and information that a contractor could use to bring their visions to life. Read on for the full story of how they gutted two full baths, enlarged closets (one of which now fits three bikes!), and lived to tell the tale of not one, but two, plumbing disasters.</em></p>

<em>Guest post by Bronx homeowner Tara</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We purchased this apartment a few years ago, after living in a 250-square-foot apartment on the West Side for about 12 years. Going from a studio apartment to a 3-bed, 2-bath was a big leap. The kitchen had already been renovated by the previous owners, so we only had to deal with the outdated bathrooms. Leaky toilets, hot water surges, and ugly yellow tile were just a few of the things we needed to remedy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We took our time in the beginning, even before <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/8457" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting our project to Sweeten</a>, to lay out exactly what we wanted room by room. We had a document with photos ready to hand to any contractor who we contacted. This made it easy for us and the contractor to make sure we were all on the same page from the start. We were also never in a rush to start the work. We started looking for a contractor at least four months before we were even ready to think about putting any money down. This gave us the luxury of taking our time to choose the firm that was right for us.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30669 size-full" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before05.jpg" alt="renovator Bronx" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before05-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />

(Above) Master bath</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We ended up going with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten design-build firm</a>. We wanted a design-build firm from the start so that someone would take charge of sourcing and delivery of all the various components of our job. Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a> included line items for everything we could possibly need, and we were free to select the fixtures that fit within the budget. When something we wanted was out of range, we either decided to find an alternative or paid the difference upfront. We also needed someone who could handle all of the Department of Buildings permits, as well as our co-op’s application process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had a specific vision for this renovation. We planned to gut the bathrooms and add ceiling fans in all of the bedrooms and living room, new radiator covers in the bedrooms, and lighting and doors throughout. The bathroom in the master was very narrow, and we wanted to move the tub out of the guest bath and into the master. Moving the location of the tub, and expanding the bathroom by about two feet, solved the narrowness issue.</p>

(During) Master bath ceiling reveals a waste line wrapped in duct tape<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30673 mt-24 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06.jpg" alt="renovator Bronx" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>We really were excited to pick out all the new fixtures and tiles for the bathrooms. Our contractor offered several options within our budget. We wanted to see and touch the cabinets and faucets before committing to them. Our thinking was if we’re going to be living with these things for years to come, we needed to like how they felt, and more importantly, wanted to see the quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We visited several showrooms in the NYC area to see the Kohler line of cabinets and the Brizo faucets that we ultimately chose. We liked the Fantini sink faucet and shape of the handles for the guest bath; it also matched the black finish of the Brizo line used in the shower. To keep the ordering simple, we used the same family of fixtures and cabinets in both bathrooms, with different finishes for each.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We chose a fun feature as an accent in the shower: a round tile in shades of white, blue, and green from a company called Clayhaus in Oregon. Our biggest challenge was timing the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">special order and delivery</a> around the completion of the first bathroom. The tiles took about six weeks to fabricate, and we ended up being about two weeks off. Luckily, the crew had other projects around our apartment to complete while waiting for the tile to arrive.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When our master bath ceiling was opened up during demolition, the contractor found that the waste line from the toilet above had been wrapped in duct tape during a prior renovation. We immediately reported this to building management, who arranged to have the pipe replaced. Their plumber worked with our contractor to gain access, and within a day the situation was resolved.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Enlarging the master bath with extra square footage resulted in an added benefit, giving us space in our bedroom to accommodate a large dresser next to the newly combined <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closets</a>.<br />
In the guest room, we widened the closet to make it suitable for bike storage. We can now get three bikes in there with room for other gear along the sides and floor.</p>

<p>During the renovation, we had no options for moving off-site, but having a contractor who understood our needs, and the fact that we would be <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living on site</a> the entire time, made the process bearable. The first few weeks of disruption were the hardest, but we settled into a routine and focused on the outcome. And because we were dealing with two bathrooms, we could only start the second one when the first was completed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While our own renovation went smoothly, with all pipes and fittings replaced and brought up to code, it was an external problem that delayed the final weeks of work. Nearing what would have been the end of the project, we came home to water pouring down from a bathtub located in the apartment two floors above us. An older pipe leading from the tub drain had eroded completely and detached from the waste line. Bath water had been spilling down for hours while we were at work. Our crew was not on site that day, and the unit above ours was vacant. With no one to report the leak, it was ours to deal with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That was the most devastating moment because we were so close to completion but now had to deal with the clean-up and dry-out of brand new walls and flooring. We put in a claim with our insurance carrier to cover the cost of the repairs, and wanted our team to do the work, since they were still on site, knew our building and our home. We could trust them to work unsupervised. They were willing to stick around and do this repair, but it was at least three months and multiple visits by an insurance adjuster before we could agree on a scope of work and monetary settlement. Luckily, both bathrooms were still usable and we made sure there was no mold growing between the walls. When all was said and done, both spaces were finished about ten months after the start date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to the start of the renovation, our biggest question was whether we would be able to find a reliable contractor. We would be trusting them with our home, our valuables, and our dog, for several months, day in and day out, while we were at work. We wondered if they would do the best job they were capable of, or would they cut corners? Would they stand by their work?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m happy to say that they went above and beyond our expectations, standing by us when we had a major leak that damaged a significant portion of their work. They also took excellent care of our home. Sweeten was a great resource, and knowing that they were there to assist us was valuable when going into a major renovation. I don’t think we would have had as easy of a time finding a solid and reliable contractor if we had not used Sweeten from the start.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Clinton Hill renovation brings upgrades from the kitchen to a tough wood flooring decision</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">British expat Sam and her American husband, Sean, had been living in Park Slope for several years when they made the decision to find a place to buy. While they casually searched in Park Slope and its surrounding neighborhoods, they also prepared their finances and readied themselves for when it came time to make an offer. A fortuitous series of events led them to bid on—and win!—the first apartment they visited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten <span class="s1">shares</span> their (enviably easy) search and how they transformed a long-empty, rundown apartment into a beautiful home for a growing family.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Having heard horror stories from friends who suffered through multiple failed bids, Sam and Sean anticipated a difficult process. They imagined that they might also face rejection, so they jumped into the process with an offer after their first open house visit in the nearby Clinton Hill neighborhood.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">They realized that the space was old and hadn’t been lived in for quite some time, but were able to see past the grimy kitchen and bath, as well as the worn floors and peeling paint in this two-bedroom apartment in the famed Clinton Hill Co-ops (<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we’re big fans</a>, as you know). The large bedrooms were a big plus, while the generous common area could open up even further by removing walls separating the kitchen from the dining and living rooms. Otherwise, the size and layout were exactly right for their family of four, and they would remain within commuting distance to their daycare. The listed price also left room in their budget for the renovation the apartment so desperately needed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When the discussion came around to renovation at the Open House, the listing agent, <span style="color: #000000;">Tom Stuart</span> (who coincidentally also lived in the CHCs), mentioned that Sweeten would be an option for their project, given the ever-growing list of Sweeten alumni in the complex. So as they went into contract, Sam <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/10514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> and requested bids from contractors. A Sweeten contractor fit the bill, and they got to work updating the apartment after a slight delay in obtaining approval from the board and managing agent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To create a feeling of spaciousness, walls were knocked down to open sight lines between all of the common areas. (With two kids under five, this was especially important.) Sam wanted the kitchen to feel as large as possible by New York City standards, since the couple cooks frequently. The contractor closed off one of the openings between the hallway and the kitchen, so that a pantry and refrigerator could be installed in that space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the opposite side of the kitchen, in place of the old walls framing the dining area, a peninsula was installed for additional counter space and storage. The sink was moved out of a cramped corner, and placed alongside the dishwasher for ease of access. Sam chose to go with stock cabinets for the affordability factor. (Also, by this point, they learned that Sam was pregnant with their third child, meaning that this was unlikely to be their forever home!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When considering the palette, soothing neutrals provided a subtle backdrop to the inevitable and colorful chaos that always accompanies kids and their toys. In terms of storage, the full-length pantry was outfitted with pull-out drawers for maximum accessibility. Drawers were also installed in the peninsula instead of shelves. The kitchen design also included a Lazy Susan in the upper corner, so that hard-to-reach items in the back wouldn&#8217;t be a problem. Lastly, an integrated garbage bin kept the trash out of sight.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Deciding early on they did not want the hassle of obtaining plumbing permits, the couple left the fixtures in their original locations and instead focused on finding brighter, cleaner replacement options. They carried the same neutral look in the small bathroom, installing open shelving, a large mirror, and a metal-legged console sink to reduce the feeling of clutter. Behind the mirror is a spacious medicine cabinet for toiletries. And although a console sink meant no storage underneath—a brave choice for a family bathroom!—Sam reports that they’ve had no problems on that front, given the large hallway closet right outside the bath. For tile, a classic white subway tile on the walls and a subtly-patterned cement tile on the floor set a tranquil feel, while Pottery Barn lighting rounded out the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the rest of the apartment, the couple’s Sweeten contractor also refinished the floors and installed carpet over the hardwood in the bedrooms. Sam confides that it was Sean’s preference and she was initially unswayed, knowing it would be a controversial choice. But having lived with it now for a few months, they love the softness underfoot, especially for playing with their kids. (Plus, the wood remains intact and an option for restoration in the future.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the two closets in the master bedroom were combined into one, and the entire apartment was <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/skim-coating-in-5-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim-coated</a> and repainted. One thing that Sam wished they had done—and are now in the process of doing—was to paint and finish the undersides of the cabinets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23093 size-full" title="Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, the duo attempted to visit the work site regularly. In fact, this is her tip to future renovators: “Go to the apartment every week, at the very least. At first, we only visited on the weekends, when we had time. But the contractors weren’t working then. We realized that checking in at some point during working hours was a huge help, and that things went more smoothly when we did that, even though it was a pain. We could discuss issues as they came up, and see what they were talking about.” The renovation was completed within four months, allowing them to turn their attention to their next major project, a new baby!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thanks to Sam, Sean, Ellie, Ernie, and baby Alice, for sharing your home! We hope that you’ll make some great memories in that gorgeous space. (Special thanks to Sam for sending over the list of resources on her due date!)</em></p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Carroll Gardens homeowner Kim Solop </span></i></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After ten years of living in our Carroll Gardens condo, we really needed a change. We contemplated a move to the suburbs or upgrading to a bigger place in a less popular Brooklyn neighborhood. After almost a year of looking and being priced out in our current neighborhood, we decided to renovate our current place, a two-bed, two-bath, 1,200 square-foot condo that we bought in 2006. We loved our current neighborhood with its proximity to our workplaces, lots of cute restaurants, shops, and our two sons’ schools. The problems were in the apartment itself: I was unhappy with the dark kitchen—I always had been. I love taking baths but hated the jet tub that was installed over a decade ago. Lastly, our laundry closet had a lot of wasted space and I wanted to add a walk-in pantry!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a big fan of home decor blogs, I had been stalking the Sweeten site for a while, and really loved seeing the transformations that the contractors could do with space. I was excited for the chance to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/15462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our renovation</a>. I met with a couple of them, and decided on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>. I really clicked with the project managers and could see that we would have a good partnership.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My main objective for the kitchen was to brighten it up and eliminate the space between the cabinets and the ceiling. I hated how this wasted space looked and the amount of dust it collected. After a few weeks of sourcing materials, we were ready to go! I knew from the get-go that I wanted a white kitchen, as well as shaker-style cabinets with quartz countertops that were marble look-alikes. Other than that, I was pretty open to ideas. Our contractor came over with a wealth of ideas for how we could open the kitchen up to maximize light. (Unfortunately, there are no windows in the kitchen, so there was only so much we could do.) I debated another set of cabinets on top of the current ones, but eventually decided against it. I switched gears a bit on the white color palette, choosing instead a dual-tone kitchen with white uppers and gray lower cabinets. After living with long pulls, I decided to go with smaller handles on all the cabinetry. Quartz countertops were also a must, for the durability factor! With two kids and a husband who are not always the neatest, I knew that we needed a tough work surface. I was adamant about getting a wine fridge. As members of a few wine clubs, we struggled to find space to keep our wine at the right temperatures.</p>

<p>Our microwave above the range was replaced with a microwave drawer, and a hood was installed above the stovetop instead. With the new wine fridge taking up precious cabinet space, I did lose a place for pots and pans. Our contractor was able to give me deep drawers in the pantry to make up for this lost storage. My other kitchen must-haves were a deep, white porcelain sink, and an under-counter pull-out garbage can.</p>

<p>Across the kitchen was a room that held just the washer and dryer with inaccessible space that was wasted. When we extended the wall, there was room for a customized pantry with countertops, shelving, and cabinetry that matched the kitchen. After not having a pantry for so long, it’s amazing to have one, and the additional space has really been a lifesaver. I had envisioned barn doors, but there was not enough wall space for it. The double doors we ended up hanging looked so plain and boring. I had some wallpaper left over from the hallway&#8211;so I went for it and covered the doors too. I think it turned out nicely.</p>

<p>For the bathroom, I wanted a totally new look that was modern and clean. We went with dark floors, a deep soaking tub, and a floating vanity. Our contractor showed me a picture of another bathroom he did, and I loved it so much, we copied it almost exactly. It came out perfectly and I am fighting my older son almost daily for baths! The tub is divine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We actually lived in the space during the whole renovation, which lasted about seven weeks. It was definitely challenging and required a lot of patience. The contractor and his crew were great about cleaning up, however, and we made the best of it with lots of takeout dinners.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading the Sweeten blog for so many years, it was exciting to embark on my own renovation. I realized that renovating is messy and dirty, and almost always takes longer than you had originally anticipated. You learn to roll with the punches, and realize that things happen. We had a few hiccups along the way, such as wanting the barn door on the pantry that wasn’t going to work, so I learned to compromise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoyed working with our Sweeten contractor,  who made himself available at all hours. He was in constant communication and has remained a friend to this day. We love our new kitchen and other improvements, and are planning on staying to enjoy them for many years to come!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An awkward space turns sanctuary with a few simple ideas</h2>
<p>When a long apartment search finally ended, Victoria’s Secret designer Christine Yao returned to one of the first listings already crossed off her list. It was the one she ultimately closed on, and she was happy with her new home—except for her bathroom which felt like showering in a dark closet. An internet search led her to Sweeten and a match with a general contractor, who would help transform the space to echo the layout and feel of the baths she&#8217;d been pinning on Pinterest for months. With smart space reconfigurations (including a vintage sliding door) and good project management, he made it happen. In her own words, Christine tells the story, from how the thought of renovating scared her to the completion of her relaxing new dwelling.</p>

<p><em>Guest post by East Village homeowner Christine Yao</em></p>
<p>I had been living on the Lower East Side for about five years when I started looking for a place to own. My weekends became a routine, waking up and planning errands around my StreetEasy open house schedule and any listings my real estate agent sent me. The beginning was packed, usually a few on Saturday and also Sundays when I walked all over downtown and viewed up to six apartments. You quickly realize that when you are focused on staying in a specific area—for me that was roughly LES/Chinatown/East Village—there are a limited number of places to see. At first, it seemed like there were hundreds of apartments for sale, and maybe 50 you can afford. You feel like half of the 50 may not even be worth seeing from the photos but you go see them anyway. A friend who had gone through the home-buying process made a comparison to online dating—one can only tell so much from the photos, you just have to go and see it in person to really know! A few months in, I had lost out on two places, and felt a little hopeless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #a69f3d;"><em><strong>&#8220;No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?&#8221;</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, finally, six months after I started looking, I had an accepted offer and closed on a co-op in the East Village. I had actually seen this apartment at the very beginnings of my search. My brother was in town on a Sunday when I dragged him from one open house to another. We thought the apartment was in an awesome location, and was a nice size. It needed some cosmetic work, but both agreed the bathroom was terrible. It had a wall right in the middle of it with the bathtub half concealed, so it felt like you were showering in a dark closet. It was cramped, with an awkward layout, and was just in bad shape. So I crossed it off the list. The idea of a bathroom renovation was overwhelming to me, on top of buying my first home. Then six months of searching made me re-think—maybe I could. No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21673 size-large" title="bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>So now, I had a bathroom to renovate, a living space that needed a refresh, and no idea where to start. The internet brought me to Sweeten. I liked how simple and straightforward it made finding a contractor: you <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project</a> and general contractors are matched for your job. I decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>—his work was most similar to the aesthetic I was going for and he had completed a project on Sweeten with a great review.</p>
<p>My plan for the entire apartment’s look was minimalist. I love a clean space that still feels warm and cozy. Greek cave hotels and Moroccan riads are a big inspiration for me. I did have a vision of wanting the apartment to feel like a vacation&#8230;somewhere tropical and feels relaxing when you are there. The kitchen, main living area, and two bedrooms just needed a redesign. But I couldn’t imagine my day-to-day in the previous bathroom—the door opening awkwardly, the dark shower, and not being able to enjoy a bath.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21714" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02 (1)" width="600" height="900" /></p>
<p>I was hoping the middle wall obstruction could be partially removed but we wouldn’t know if it was structural until the demo. Turns out the wall had all the building plumbing running through it, so needless to say, it had to stay. However, we found serious leaks happening on the floors above and below me (I am on the third floor of a five-story building), which the building would have to fix before we could move forward. Since pipes had to be replaced, the plumbing could be re-routed, allowing us to swap tub and toilet positioning. This worked out for the best: the toilet in a “nook,” and the bathtub by the window.</p>
<p>I had so many images on my desktop saved for ideas and realized they all had the common thread of black tile floors and clean, white walls with modern fixtures. I was getting a lot of inspiration from restaurant and hotel restrooms. I definitely wanted recessed lighting above the toilet (dimmers are a must for all lighting—mood!) and exposed plumbing under the sink for more leg room.</p>
<p>I ended up ordering almost everything on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>, which has phenomenal customer service by the way. I must have looked at hundreds of sinks. We realized it had to be a corner sink or you wouldn’t have enough space to get on and off the toilet. Then the toilet had to be an appropriate size. Measured twice, measure one more time, then cross my fingers when it came in. It all fit into this Tetris game of a bathroom! I wanted a sliding door that would let light through and found an old office door at Big Reuse in Gowanus, Brooklyn. My contractor cut it down to fit the doorway and painted it.</p>

<p>The renovation was running a couple months late due to waiting on permits, so taking things like a toilet and subway tile from Home Depot that were in stock was a priority. My Sweeten contractor was so easy to work with and made things stress-free on everything from dealing with the unexpected delays and permits to coordinating a time to receive a bathtub delivery. I also trusted his aesthetic and opinion on any design or materials questions I had.</p>
<p>As far as the rest of the apartment, it’s amazing what fresh paint and swapping out things like lighting, doorknobs, and some cabinet doors can do. He did a fantastic painting job and the white floors are my favorite feature of my home. My original budget was $25,000 for renovating the bathroom and repainting the apartment. I ended up going $4,500 overbudget because I live in a co-op. The process of getting permits and running into unforeseen issues with plumbing in-between the floors increased the costs and timeline. A six-week planned renovation turned into three months. I think it was really just me underestimating the cost of labor and materials, especially living here in New York City.</p>

<p>The bathroom turned out better than I could have hoped and I am so thankful for the successful renovation I had with my contractor through Sweeten. Now that I’ve experienced the process, the advice I can offer is to be prepared for it to take longer than you think. And add another month. Be prepared to spend a good chunk of time every day on it—coordinating with your contractor, arranging delivery times, looking for fixtures, going to check on things, etc. Be ready to laugh when things go wrong. And go wrong again. It’ll be worth it when you are enjoying your renovated place, I promise.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot about the kitchen—with all of my budget going to the bathroom and painting, I just took down the cabinet doors myself and painted. That’s a move I’ve done in many apartments I’ve lived in as a renter. It’s functional for now but I can’t wait to renovate this space next!</p>
<p>Thank you Christine, for sharing your story as a first-time homeowner and renovator! You proved that a few renovating ideas can make a big impact, and we love your fresh style.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Emily moved to New York City last year, she went in search of an apartment with a warm, old-world feel. Although originally from California, she had recently spent two years living and studying in Normandy, France, where she developed an appreciation for beautiful prewar buildings that wore their age gracefully. Emily loved that the apartments she came across there—no matter how small or simple—always had ornamental features that elevated the space. Paneling, vintage doorknobs, and other small details contributed to an overall elegance, and she wanted the same for her new apartment in New York.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21355" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-21349"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A six month-long search resulted in the purchase of a 435-square-foot studio apartment in an understated 1940s building on the Upper West Side. It was a prewar apartment but also a condo, a rare combination that suited Emily’s criteria. Although it was a studio, it had distinctly separate spaces: an entryway, dressing area, kitchen, bath, and main living space, which Emily liked. Unfortunately, having been used as a longtime rental property, the apartment had been stripped of most of its original ornamentation. Instead, there was paint a dozen layers thick and worn flooring throughout the studio. In the narrow galley kitchen, there were sticky off-white cabinets, peeling vinyl floors, and almost no counter space at all. The very peachy-yellow bathroom sported tiles that didn’t match in spots where they had once been replaced, and a tank-less, industrial toilet gave the small space an unpleasantly institutional vibe. To the left of the front door, two shallow closets took up valuable floor space, which Emily felt would be better utilized as an office nook.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21368 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-02" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21367" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-01" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Emily envisioned a restoration of sorts: she wanted to add paneling and crown molding to the walls of the main living space, and to create a simple bath with a vintage black-and-white theme. The kitchen would be modern but befitting the age of the building. And although the discrete spaces of the apartment were a major selling point, Emily felt that the narrow kitchen would be much improved if it could be opened up to the main living area. Pinterest provided ample inspiration, and she set out to source the materials herself, relying heavily on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a> and other online stores.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having developed a concrete plan for the renovation, Emily and her dad, John, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> to Sweeten. John had had substantial experience with construction and renovation in the past, and with his input, Emily settled on a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. The crew quickly went to work realizing Emily’s vision, and also provided helpful suggestions and additions along the way. For example, unprompted, the contractor stripped a half-century of paint from the front door, revealing the beautiful metal patina underneath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on Emily’s direction, he created a pass-through from the galley kitchen to the living area, extending the counter through the opening to create a breakfast perch with stools. Open shelving made of marble and brass took the place of upper cabinets, creating more room to breathe in the narrow space. The appliances and sink were lined up on the left, given that the counters and base cabinets on the right were a mere nine inches deep. (The entire kitchen was just about six feet wide!) An under-counter refrigerator, paneled to blend in with the cabinets, preserved the new airiness of the space. Sadly, there was no room for a dishwasher, but a 24-inch gas range fit perfectly at the end of the counter. Finishes were consistent with those found in older buildings, featuring white subway tile, marble counters, brass detailing, charcoal gray lower cabinets, and blackened metal light fixtures with a retro feel. For the floor, Emily chose a fun Spanish tile in black and white.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21360 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21380 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08.gif" alt="" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21362 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-09" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21363 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-10" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21364" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the original dressing area, the floor space was expanded once the closets were removed. Custom shelving and a desk were cut to fit inside the nook perfectly, creating a cozy home office away from the main sleeping area. In the main room of the studio, her Sweeten contractor added small details that restored elegance to the apartment. Marble ledges on the windows, as well as wall paneling, crown molding, and new baseboards transformed the space in subtle but distinct ways. The bathroom received a similarly unpretentious and classic treatment: white subway tile with a beveled edge and black trim, matched to a matte black towel rack. To prevent an accidental burn and to disguise an unsightly floor-to-ceiling radiator pipe, he suggested that they wrap it with rope.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, unlike many of Sweeten’s renovating homeowners, Emily and John managed the project from afar—they were in California while her contractor and his team worked on her apartment. They arranged for check-ins via FaceTime or Skype, and he provided photos and updates on the work on a regular basis. Despite the 2,500 miles between them, there were remarkably few hiccups on this Sweeten project. Emily and John attributed this to good communication with the contractor and his team, but also to the fact that they went into the process with a firm plan, and sourced the materials for arrival prior to the start of the job. Emily’s advice to future renovators: “There is a lot that can go wrong when you’re renovating, but it helps to start with a good idea of what you want. And if you source the materials yourself, you can cut down on some of the variables that might delay the project.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks so much, Emily, and we hope you’re enjoying your lovely new-old studio!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years after Claudia purchased her one-bedroom, one-bath apartment in a quaint Upper East Side co-op, she felt ready to renovate. Since arriving in 2001, this software engineer knew that she’d eventually need to address the 30 year-old carpeting, fixtures, and odd space issues&#8230;or simply move on and find a new home. Loving everything about the building, the neighborhood, and her lifestyle, she decided to stay put and find a designer who could bring an architectural approach and a restorative eye to this lovely space. Read on for the stunning reveal of Claudia’s thoughtful and personal apartment renovation!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18472 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg" alt="apartment renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-18306"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia first readied herself with a straightforward list of tasks she wanted to accomplish. Sure, the place hadn’t been updated anywhere in three decades, so finishes throughout were more than dated. But she also craved more space, and after seeing neighboring units without the built-ins and boxy windows that had been added in a mid-80s renovation, she realized she might be able to reclaim some hidden square footage (and long-missing electrical outlets) in her own unit. The kitchen and bathroom needed a complete treatment, and the living room and bedroom required diametrically opposed designs: out with chunky built-ins on multiple walls in the living room, and in with a thoughtful and multi-functional built-in for the windowed bedroom wall.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishlist near complete, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claudia decided to post her project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2531" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was matched with a Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who specializes in creating architecture and interior design solutions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon meeting with Frederick and his team, Claudia made an overarching goal clear: She wasn’t interested in solely installing modern finishes over the old. The original bones were just as important as the final coat of paint. That pristine 1929 appeal needed to show through and reveal itself via new design details. With extensive renovations planned in every room, Claudia moved out of the apartment temporarily to allow for Frederick and his crew to get started. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia believed that original parquet floors were hiding underneath all the carpeting, and she was right. Frederick had the wood floors sanded and refinished, bringing them back to life without introducing any new materials. With extra sheetrock walls encroaching in multiple directions, the team chipped away at the wall of boxed windows, disposing of an 18 inch layer of brick and wood. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avert your eyes if you live in a typical NYC co-op, because you will probably NEVER experience this, but somehow Claudia nearly doubled the size of her living room windows by combining them, flooding the space with lovely natural light. All of the windows were replaced with double-paned versions, up to code with the building and boasting the required heat, freeze and UV protections. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the opposite end of the room, the crew stripped away the ever-so-slightly-asymmetrical built-in shelving and cabinetry to reveal an open, wood-burning hearth. Claudia turned to a local Italian couple who specialize in old world mantels for an understated limestone facade, and Frederick brought in a specialist to design and install crown moldings along the doorways, windows, ceiling and floor boards throughout the apartment. Claudia’s mother helped source the final touch: an accent wall in a serene, neutral palette is an elegant and stylish addition to an inviting new living room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the kitchen, Claudia knew she wanted a white kitchen and was unsentimental about getting rid of the “horrible” gray linoleum floors. Cosmetic features aside, she wanted more storage space and a way to install an exhaust fan over a new cooktop. In an attempt to carve out some casual eating space, the previous owners had put some very limited cabinetry along the left-side of the galley, and appliances took up most of the storage and prep space on the right side.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claudia chose a small pearlescent stone tile in a melange of pebble hues to take the place of the severely dated synthetic floor she’d grown to detest. High-impact cabinet changes were custom fit into the small space. Claudia worked with an Italian purveyor specializing in hidden compartments for the fridge and hood, and managed to conceal all of the major stainless steel appliances except for the striking new Bertazzoni range, because, Bertazzoni! The laminate countertops were removed and replaced with a white Caesarstone slab and corresponding backsplash, and an undermount stainless sink&#8211;supplied by the same producer as the cabinets&#8211;was installed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18452 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="white Caesarstone countertop" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18453 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18454 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="stainless undermount sink" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18455" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-08-10.gif" alt="Bertazzoni range" width="600" height="797" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia knew she didn’t need to change the footprint of her bathroom to incorporate the many features she wanted here. The tub needed two shower curtains to keep water in, the full surround of blue-gray tile muted natural light, and the bulky vanity was topped with a throwback plastic ball faucet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia went with a floor tile pick that is complementary but different to those used in the kitchen, and with Frederick’s help, incorporated extra pieces into a design detail border along the wall of freshly installed white subway tiles. The tub came out and was replaced with a slightly larger and more modern German piece to coincide with new spa accessories: a rainwater shower head plus a handheld option for added luxe. The fixed shower rod was taken down to make way for a glass partition and hinged glass door that swings out for maximum function and style. Claudia chose a pedestal sink for extra floor and knee space, opting to place storage behind hidden cabinets in the wall instead. Almost all of the bathroom features were handpicked from local design shop Elegance in Hardware, including the polished nickel door knobs, which are exclusive to the outlet.  </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bedroom, Claudia and her design-build team pursued the opposite approach. Instead of doing away with built-ins, they found areas where custom additions would have a meaningful impact on space use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They added a custom closet in the hallway, outfitted  by California Closets, just outside the bath before entering the living room and introduced this same custom storage concept in the bedroom, behind a mirrored closet wall—one of the only major features that remained. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the carpet was torn out in the bedroom, Claudia approached Frederick with her hopes of incorporating a window seat before new wall treatment and molding went in. The designer re-enlisted his subcontractor to fashion a custom wooden seat built right into the new shelving set. The homeowner would just need an upholstered cushion and good book to make it complete.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia revealed to us that upon visiting her apartment, after the renovations were complete and the dust had nearly cleared, she stood and looked around the empty rooms and was filled with the sense that nothing had changed. It was as if she were apartment shopping in 1929, which, she explained, is exactly what she wanted.</span></p>

<i>Guest post by Steve Townsend, Manhattan architect and homeowner </i><br />
<span id="more-16257"></span><br />
When I moved in with my girlfriend, Lauren, to our one-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side, it was clear that the kitchen had suffered from some serious neglect. The apartment has been in her family for decades, with her parents purchasing it several years ago from her grandparents as an investment property. It has been an eternal revolving door of short-term family tenants. I am an architect and she works in television advertising, but it was apparent to both of us that the outdated design needed a remedy. Renovating the apartment was always an end goal, but having an architect in the relationship accelerated those plans, because: free obligated labor!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The design problems with the kitchen were immediately apparent. The building was constructed in the 1970s, and apart from the finishes and appliances not being replaced throughout its lifetime, the layout harkened back to a simpler time – when nobody wanted to see their kitchens and apparently there was never more than one person in the kitchen at a time. It was remarkably small and completely enclosed—an ‘L’ shape configuration with a door at each end—with very limited counter and storage space. The walls ensured that no natural light made its way in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am not typically on the client side of construction projects like this – typically the client handles finding and hiring the contractor, and as architects, we then work with whoever is contracted. Moreover, we typically engage in larger scale projects in New York and abroad, so our local network of contractors is limited. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> provided an instant network of screened contractors, who specialize in this scale and scope of project, and lined up a series of contractors who were both interested and qualified.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16284" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-01-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16285" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Because the design was finalized (rendering above) when we reached out to prospective contractors, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we were very clear with the plan</a>, we just needed someone who would complement our vision and desires. After meeting with Sweeten’s recommendations, we decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Kris</a>. His team specializes in renovations like ours, and his aesthetic was remarkably aligned with our own.</p>
<p>The objectives of the design were simple: open up the whole space, maximize counter space without sacrificing storage, and obviously replace all appliances and cabinets. The new cabinets and finishes needed to be durable and the layout functional for two passionate chefs. The plan became pretty clear: blow out the walls and consolidate the appliances to the back walls.</p>
<p>We kept the existing ‘L’ configuration, but enlarged it by demolishing all of the partitions and replacing them with a large island. The island instantly doubled our counter space while adding all the below-counter storage. Because we enjoy hosting dinners and making cooking more of a communal experience, we opted for a two-tiered island with a counter-height side at the kitchen and a bar-height side facing the rest of the apartment. And since we eliminated two closets as part of the demolition, we included full height cabinets and shelves on the wall outside of the kitchen to serve as storage and a pantry closet, without intruding too far into the space.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-16258 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="kitchen island with bar height" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p>These changes gave us vast spatial improvement to the apartment and made room for a complete update of all the appliances. We knew we wanted professional-grade appliances and we let these choices serve as the foundation of many design decisions. In order to get the feeling of a commercial kitchen, the appliances are stainless steel, which go well with the rest of the space. We opted for a large <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluestar</a> 6-burner range, which is really the centerpiece of the new equipment, as well as a Fridgidaire fridge and a KitchenAid dishwasher.</p>
<p>In order to accentuate the openness and lightness of the new design, we decided to go with all-white finishes for all the vertical surfaces – custom white lacquered cabinets and white subway tile for the backsplash and other walls. In order to contrast the white surfaces, we decided on a dark gray Caesarstone counter and a ceramic floor tile in a similar hue.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-16260 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="white lacquered kitchen cabinets" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p>Kris&#8217;s experience in this kind of work was invaluable throughout the process, and when minor hiccups occurred – as they invariably do in these types of projects – his creativity and expertise always led to innovative solutions. The end result is a really fantastic change from the original apartment. Aside from now having a better functioning and more practical layout for a kitchen, the whole apartment is brighter and more open.</p>
