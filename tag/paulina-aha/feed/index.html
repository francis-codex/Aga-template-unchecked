<p><b>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</b></p>
<p>We&#8217;re both from Poland and have been in construction for about 10 years.</p>
<p><b>How did you get into construction? </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paulina</span>: I had to be like 11 years old when my dad hired an architect to design a little fireplace outside of our house. I thought she was so cool because she came out with a lot of drawings and blueprints. I thought, &#8220;Wow, this is really, really amazing.&#8221; Ever since I met that architect, I was inspired to design. Later, when I worked for a construction company, I decided I actually wanted to design and build.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;\nP: My dad, for me, I think. The first time, oh my God, I had to be like 11. He hired an architect to design a little fireplace outside of our house and I thought she was so cool because she came out with a lot of the drawings and blueprints and stuff. And I was like, \&quot;Wow, this is really, really amazing.\&quot; So, for me, it was seeing her being an architect and designing. I wanted to design and then when I worked for a construction company, I decided I actually wanted to also do design and build.\nA: Actually, construction was like my passion. When I was 19 years old, I just started to do something small in the house. I loved this from the beginning and that's like my hobby now and I work this really, so I like my job.\nP: You did a lot of wood working.\nA: Yes.\nP: Built like stuff when he was younger.\nA: Yeah, and younger. 15 years old, I--\nP: He worked as a carpenter since he was 16 years old?\nA: Yeah.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Albert</span>: Construction has always been my passion. I did a lot of woodworking when I was very young and worked as a carpenter when I was 16. I loved it from the beginning. What used to be a hobby became something I did professionally. I love my job.</span></p>
<p><strong>What do you love most about construction?</strong></p>
<p>Different projects and the clients—you pick a project, go from start to finish, and then start again with a different project. There&#8217;s a uniqueness to the changing environment.</p>
<p><b>What is your ideal client?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Someone who has a general sense of what they’re looking for, but maybe didn&#8217;t have a chance to get the advice they needed. I like when we find somebody that we can actually help. They&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Okay! Nobody actually explained it to me like that!&#8221;</p>

<p><b>What is the biggest challenge you see for renovating in New York?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of running our workshop, for sure. We have a huge facility where we run a custom cabinetry and millwork shop which we also use for our renovations.</p>
<p><b>Yankees or Mets?</b></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t understand baseball, we&#8217;re Polish—soccer!</p>
<p><strong><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;Favorite New York City building or structure?&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,17153,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,null,1&#093;">Favorite New York City building or structure?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Albert</strong></span>: The Empire State building.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Paulina</strong></span>: I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t have a favorite one. I love New York City!</p>
