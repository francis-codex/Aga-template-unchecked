										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Renovating former rental properties to become sources of comfort, instead of income</h2>
<p>No matter how well you take care of a home, things can be damaged accidentally or worn down over time. This is especially true when renovating former rental properties. Especially when tenants move in and out year after year.</p>
<p>Sometimes, homeowners need a break from the stress of renting a property. And sometimes, they&#8217;re ready to hang up their hats as landlords and update their former leasing properties to live in themselves. To take care of the wear and tear and to suit their needs and style, these homeowners turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors. Here are four renovation projects aimed at renovating former rental properties into forever homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35590 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-723x482.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, bathroom renovation, vanity, walnut, open storage, round mirror, convert a rental into a primary residence" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>1.) Outdated Rental Property to Modern Apartment</h3>
<p>Sherry’s family purchased a Midtown East apartment in 2008. While they originally bought it as a rental property, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/millennial-apartment-renovation-midtown-east/">Sherry decided to move in</a> just ten years later. However, it hadn’t been renovated since the ‘80s and had extensive water damage from a previous tenant. Still, the apartment had good bones (and space!). Her remodel involved replacing the flooring in every room. She also completely updated the kitchen and bathrooms to reflect her modern style.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21360 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="convert a rental into primary residence, kitchen, black and white" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>2. Prewar Studio to Charming Apartment</h3>
<p>New York City’s housing market is full of prewar apartments with elaborate features. When Emily moved to the city, she was in search of just that: <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a charming apartment with original details</a>. Her six-month search ended with the purchase of a 1940s studio apartment.</p>
<p>The apartment had long been used as a rental property—and didn&#8217;t reflect its historical roots. She worked with her Sweeten general contractor to restore the apartment to its former glory. They installed beautiful crown molding and paneling throughout.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30008 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="convert a rental into primary residence, bathroom" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>3.) Former Rental Property turned Uptown Retreat</h3>
<p>Ying and her parents’ Upper East Side apartment had seen many lives. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-rental-studio-becomes-a-pied-a-terre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Originally purchased as an investment</a>, the owners and renters had lived in the apartment off and on. After the family hit their co-op’s rental limit, they decided to reimagine the space as a second home. The family added new flooring, paint, lighting, custom built-ins, and an overhauled bathroom.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30242 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-723x482.jpg" alt="convert a rental into primary residence" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>4.) Updated Urban Residence</h3>
<p>After renting out their Manhattan property for over a decade, JoAnn and Brian were ready to call the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-rental-becomes-a-cozy-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">urban residence their permanent home</a>. The couple was leaving behind a six-bedroom house in New Jersey for this mid-town one-bedroom. With that said, they needed an efficient space. That meant an emphasis on storage in the main living areas and bedroom. The kitchen and bathroom had also seen better days. The couple completely redid the two spaces while sticking to the original layout.</p>

<h3>What is design-build?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Design-build firms are a growing segment of the construction landscape. About 15% of the American Institute of Building Design (AIBD) members are now design-build firms, said Steve Mickley, the executive director of the organization, which is made up of designers, builders, and architects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the name suggests, a design-build firm takes care of both the design and construction phases of a renovation project. Traditionally, the process involved homeowners working with a designer or an architect before taking those plans over to a general contractor to execute the vision. Now, those specialties exist under one roof with design-build. Here, we explain the role of these remodeling professionals.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">How are design-build companies structured? </h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no clear-cut definition as to what a design-build firm is and who is in their employ. Usually, a firm will either be more design-forward, primarily led by an architect or a designer, or construction-forward with a general contractor taking the reins. Of course, some firms can be an even balance of both.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever the scenario of the firm and your project, “the best approach is to interview as many people as it takes to find someone you feel comfortable with,&#8221; advised Mickley. That could mean going with a design-build firm or handpicking a designer and a general contractor. This more traditional method is called design, bid, and build, or DBB. It is where the designer or architect is hired separately from the general contractor. </p>
<h4>Are professional design services always necessary for a remodel?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not every remodeling project needs a designer or architect. According to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association, only 22% of homeowners renovating a kitchen or bathroom seek professional design assistance. Instead, many chose to work closely with an experienced general contractor on their design to bring down their total costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, if the scope of your project involves structural changes like moving load-bearing walls or shifting plumbing or gas lines, you will at least need an architect or engineer to approve your renovation plans. Bringing in design help is also a good option if you want meticulous planning and attention to visual details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What are the benefits of hiring a design-build company?</h3>
<h4>&#8220;One-stop&#8221; shop</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Design-build firms operate as a “one-stop shop” for home construction, said Mickley. This means homeowners only need to explain their vision to one person who then communicates it to the single design-build team. This is also the case throughout the project. If a change needs to be made, no need to discuss it with your designer or architect and then communicate it to your general contractor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a design-build firm, you should have one point person throughout the entire length of your project who is accountable for the timeline, the budget, and delivering what the homeowner wants. “The same person who has the vision has the responsibility to make that happen,” said Mickley.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Project management help</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some homeowners want to closely oversee their renovations. Others don’t. For the latter group, a design-build firm might be a good fit. Rather than the homeowner overseeing the two moving parts of the design and construction phase, a design-build firm watches over both.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a little help with managing a project but aren’t sure you want a design-build firm to take care of the whole thing, some designers or architects may offer a service to help oversee the job. “This is where the designer or architect makes periodic site visits to make sure the general contractor is doing everything to the specifications,” said Mickley.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Guaranteed synergy</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s always a risk of a personality clash when you pair two humans together. That includes your choice of designer or architect and general contractor. They could work together seamlessly, or they could not. Working with a design-build firm basically eliminates that risk. The design half and construction half would have worked together on many projects and likely created a firm together based on their positive collaboration. “Depending on the project, you could be working with them for six to 12 months, so it’s best to choose wisely,” said Mickley.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">A faster project</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, things can go wrong with any project and slow the timeline down, including one managed by a design-build firm. However, this type of firm will likely complete a job at a faster pace. A study commissioned by the DBIA found that commercial projects using design-build firms finished about 33% faster than those that used the traditional design, bid, and build process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s reason to think residential projects could also move faster with a design-build firm. That’s because there is likely an overlap between the design and construction phase rather than a lull in momentum when the design phase ends and a general contractor takes up the build phase.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changes you make along the way could also be done faster, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary</a>, who heads up a <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>-vetted design-build firm. Often with the traditional design, bid, and build workflow, a change to your project will require some back and forth between architect and general contractor to see what’s possible and what the best way forward is. This could hold the project up for weeks or more. With a design-build firm, you have your architect and builder already working together and abreast of the project. “Pretty much within a couple of days we can have everything sorted out,” said Gary.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Less expensive (maybe)</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given that design-build is slowly gaining momentum in the residential market, the data isn’t yet available to know what workflow method is easier on the pocketbook. In commercial construction, DBIA found that projects with this category of professionals came in at six percent cheaper when compared with similar jobs using the design, bid, and build workflow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why you might NOT prefer design-build</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Less control</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we mentioned above, a design-build firm generally means less control for the homeowner, which is great if that’s what you want. However, if you know you want to be hands-on with your construction project, take that into consideration when choosing between design-build or the typical design, bid, and build.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Less choice of professionals</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again, this can be a pro or a con. It’s definitely a con if you have your heart set on an architect and a general contractor who are not part of the same firm. One thing Mickley advised when considering a design-build firm is to ensure they can produce quality designs. “Some design-build firms call themselves that, but they really don’t possess the design portion,” he said. “They just subcontract that out.”</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">More objective solutions</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having the eyes of a separate general contractor and architect could mean more objective observations about how your project is progressing. It could also mean more ideas. If there’s a problem in need of a solution, you have your architect or designer as well as your general contractor to brainstorm with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sweeten can help you hire the right firm</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regardless of which way you ultimately lean on your construction and design, selecting who you work with is a crucial decision. “Once you’ve made that decision, you have to give them your full trust,” said Gary.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<h2></h2>
<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1635933324509"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is design-build?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Design-build firms are firms that provide a homeowner with a general contractor, architect, and/or interior designer. They are considered “one-stop” shops because they offer varying services within one company. Design-build firms might be more design-based, some more construction-heavy, and others have a good balance of each. A positive aspect of these firms is communication: because these teams are built to work together, there’s less confusion about responsibilities or how to connect with the renovating homeowner.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1635933385594"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Are design-build firms more expensive?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Design-build firms can be more expensive to work with than construction-only firms because the service level they offer is higher. These firms are ideal for renovating homeowners who want to (or need to) enlist the help of an architect and/or interior designer, in addition to a general contractor. For example, homeowners doing a transformational gut renovation will likely need the help of a design-build firm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Keeping gas and plumbing in place? A contractor may be all you need</h2>
<p>Ever imagine what’d it be like to take your kitchen down to the studs and start over again? We’re not talking about knocking down walls or changing the placement of the sink or range—or anything that would mean moving plumbing or rerouting electricity. What we’re talking about is a clean swap. Out with the old—cabinets, countertop, backsplash, appliances—and in with the new. Perhaps you’re just looking for a simple upgrade for your kitchen (and by simple, we mean minimal changes to the structure, plumbing, or electrical). Or you’re dealing with budget or structural limitations that require an architect. Whatever your reasons for this kind of kitchen renovation, which typically takes between 1-2 months to complete, a general contractor may be all you need for a total refresh.</p>

</a><span class="img-label"> A <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/quick-download-greenpoint-kitchen-basks-newly-found-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen</a> in Greenpoint, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A dark, crowded kitchen in Greenpoint was in desperate need of some lightening and brightening. The original kitchen had wood cabinets with a dark finish and a matching black backsplash and countertop that consistently showed dirt. In order to give this kitchen the facelift it needed, all of the kitchen cabinets were removed and replaced with white, flat-front <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinets</a> to provide a more modern look. Some of the upper cabinets were removed to make way for open shelving to give the space an overall lighter feeling. The old countertop got swapped for stone in a medium gray shade and the backsplash was replaced with veined marble tile. While the homeowner kept the original appliances, new cabinets, shelving, counters, and backsplash gave the kitchen the boost it needed for a bright new beginning.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything in Cybele’s kitchen—old cabinets, coffee-colored backsplash, dark counters, and mismatched appliances—was ripped out, making the space an empty box ready for a fresh start. The old penny tile on the floor was removed, the subfloor was leveled, and then new flooring—faux wood porcelain tile—was installed. Walls were gutted to gain extra space for new counters and the old dark <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countertop</a> was replaced with white quartz. New cabinets were installed, including taller upper cabinets with crown molding, and some of the lower cabinets were removed to make room for a dishwasher. Old backsplash tile was replaced with glossy teal subway tile and crisp white grout. The kitchen renovation thoroughly refreshed the space without any changes to the original floor plan, and new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-appliances-worth-hype/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appliances</a> included a compact microwave with a matching stainless steel shelf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26494 mb-10 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation with high-gloss cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01-723x496.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="496" /><br />
</a><span class="img-label"> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/lisas-sweetened-upper-east-side-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisa’s kitchen</a> on the Upper East Side</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lisa’s kitchen was tiny, just 54 square feet, its cabinets were too shallow to hold her servingware or pots and pans, and the drawers were too narrow. Nothing was as it should be, so the kitchen was gutted right down to the studs and subfloor. Semi-custom cabinets with a high-gloss finish and greater depth were installed, instantly improving the form and function of the space. The stained, laminate countertop was replaced with a bright, white quartz. White subway tile took the place of the old, cracked <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backsplash</a>, and a pinstripe of gray tile was added for a bit of flair. The existing appliances, which were beginning to short out and die, were substituted with a new dishwasher, counter-depth refrigerator, range, and microwave. The new look is clean and minimal—exactly what Lisa had in mind when she set out to upgrade her kitchen.</p>
