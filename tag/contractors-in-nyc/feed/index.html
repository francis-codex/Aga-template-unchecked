<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;I'm originally from Albania.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;">I&#8217;m originally from Albania. </span>I have been in construction for about 10 years and opened up my own company about five years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;How did you get into construction?&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,17153,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,null,1&#093;">How did you get into construction?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;Coming here , moving out here, I guess, everybody seemed to be in construction. I moved here when I was 13 years old, my\u00a0dad worked in construction, and then a lot of people coming in to the US or coming to New York, they-- obviously, this was our entry way to construction. Then I grew up and I went to school, I graduated and part of me was still-- I felt something about construction. So what I did, after graduating, I looked at construction and I said it worked for me. It's something that I really liked, it's something-- building. I guess something about building and then\u00a0getting appreciation for something. Kind of build something and then you get to look\u00a0at it and say, \&quot;Wow.\&quot;\u00a0And then, you get that reaction from the people you're doing it for. So, that's very rewarding for me.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;">I moved to the United States when I was 13 years old. Coming here, everybody seemed to be in construction. </span>My dad worked in construction too, so I grew up with it. Building is something that I&#8217;ve always really liked. When clients look at my work and say, &#8220;Wow,&#8221; it&#8217;s very rewarding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Who is your ideal client?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;Ideal client &#091;laughter&#093;. Somebody whose not going to break my back all the time. No. My ideal client would be somebody who \u00a0 has a vision of what they want to do, and then me bringing in my experience and their vision together. And have a sort of collaboration to making something that maybe hasn't been done before, or creating\u00a0something fun and exciting.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;">I like working with somebody who has a vision of what they want to do, that I can help bring together. I like collaborating with my clients to do something fun and exciting that hasn&#8217;t been done before.</span></p>

<p><strong>Yankees or Mets?</strong></p>
<p><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;I don't even watch baseball, I'm sorry &#091;chuckles&#093;.
