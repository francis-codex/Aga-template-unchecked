<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date NYC</span><span class="s2"> </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Imagining your dream kitchen is easy; budgeting for it is complicated. If you&#8217;re planning a kitchen remodel, we&#8217;ll help you understand your options, and offer guidance on major expenses and hidden costs you may encounter. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">From building requirements to permits and design, here are the average kitchen renovation costs to expect in NYC. These figures are broken out by finish level, and are based on Sweeten renovations: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen renovation costs: Starting at <b>$25,000 </b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen renovation costs: Starting at <b>$35,000</b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen renovation costs: Starting at <b>$65,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Start planning your kitchen renovation now. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of many construction materials and fixtures. For homeowners interested in remodeling, it’s smart to quickly sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. We also advise locking in a start date on the contractor’s calendar. Waiting could lead to longer delays, and even more severe price inflation on materials.</span> <em><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection—at no cost to you.</span></em></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-01.png"><img decoding="async" title="cost-estimate-for-renovation" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-01.png" alt="Cost estimate for renovation" width="1080" height="380" class="alignnone wp-image-51060 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-01.png 1080w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-01-300x106.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-01-600x211.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></a></span></h3>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">From budget to high-end kitchen appliances and finishes </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Appliances, fixtures, and finishing materials all lie on a spectrum, whether you&#8217;re doing a budget kitchen remodel or a high-end one. Your choice of quality level (often called &#8220;finish level&#8221;) is a major factor in the cost of a kitchen renovation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Budget” kitchen materials are generally off-the-shelf items from “big box” stores or IKEA. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Mid-grade” kitchen materials balance cost with quality. Examples include engineered wood flooring and products from GE, Caesarstone, Kohler, or Benjamin Moore. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“High-end” kitchen materials prioritize quality over cost. Products include hardwood flooring or marble, and brands like Bertazzoni, Ann Sacks, and Farrow &amp; Ball. This category may also include special materials sourced from overseas suppliers, and fully custom fabrications.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-02.png"><img decoding="async" title="breakup-of-renovation-cost" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-02.png" alt="Breakup of cost" width="1080" height="1080" class="alignnone wp-image-51061 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-02.png 1080w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-02-300x300.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-02-150x150.png 150w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-02-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></a></span></h3>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">How much do materials for a kitchen renovation cost?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Cabinets</strong>   budget: $130/linear foot (LF)  |  mid-grade: $1000/LF |  high-end: $2000/LF <strong>Appliances</strong>  budget: $2,500  |  mid-grade: $5000  |  high-end: $17,000–$26,000 <strong>Vent hood</strong>  budget: $200  |  mid-grade: $500  |  high-end: $5,000+ <strong>Countertops</strong>  budget: $5/sqft  |  mid-grade: $50/sqft |  high-end: $100/sqft <strong>Backsplash</strong>  budget: $3/sqft  |  mid-grade: $15/sqft  |  high-end: $35/sqft <strong>Flooring (tile)</strong>  budget: $3/sqft  |  mid-grade: $15/sqft |  high-end: $35/sqft <strong>Sink</strong>  budget: $150  |  mid-grade: $500  |  high-end: $2000+ <strong>Cabinet hardware</strong>  budget: $5/piece  |  mid-grade: $30/piece |  high-end: $300/piece <strong>Lighting</strong>  budget: $50/piece  |  mid-grade: $200/piece |  high-end: $500/piece</p>
<ul class="ul1"></ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A note about cabinetry: In high-end kitchens that feature custom millwork, the cabinetry often accounts for a high percentage of both materials and labor costs. The starting point for basic custom cabinetry is <b>$1,000</b> per linear foot. There are many other factors—drawers are costlier than shelves, and features such as Lazy Susans, pull-out pantries, specialized compartments, and soft-close hinges all increase costs. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Custom cabinets are not just for large houses; apartment owners with limited kitchen depth may benefit even more by going custom. Shallower cabinets can fit tighter spaces, while deeper cabinets can hold larger dinner plates and platters. You may also have an odd-shaped space or awkward corner that you&#8217;d like to accommodate with a cabinet, to maximize a small kitchen&#8217;s storage. Choices like these require custom work, because prefabricated cabinets offer fewer options. Read more about the difference between <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">custom and prefab cabinets here</span></a>.</span></p>

<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Kitchen renovation costs for permits, design, and behind-the-scenes items</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The average kitchen remodel costs are comprised of both visible and invisible items. Here are the &#8220;invisible&#8221; behind-the-scenes budget items to keep on your radar.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Building requirements</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Building boards / HOAs can play a significant role in dictating design and budget needs for apartment owners. These requirements can range from insurance coverage minimums, which limit your ability to work with professionals who aren’t carrying high-value insurance policies, to alteration agreements that require anyone doing any work in the building to have far-reaching coverage for problems they may never encounter, like asbestos removal or collapse scenarios.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive requirements tend to have higher operating costs and can meet higher insurance requirements, more stringent debris removal expectations, limited noise and hours-of-work requirements, and stricter parking rules. While there is no exact figure on this, you may see this translate into higher rates overall for teams that can meet those demands.</span></p>
<h4>City permits</h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Plumbing services:<b> $2,000 –</b> <b>$3,500. </b> Possibly higher, if you have more than the usual number of plumbing fixtures. </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Plumbing permits: <b>$2,000 –</b> <b>$5,000 </b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Electrical permits: <b>$900</b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Asbestos inspection: <b>$500</b> – <b>$1,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The City’s Department of Buildings requires a permit for any plumbing work that exceeds a minor repair or a direct swap of a similar fixture. Adding outlets or electrical circuits will require an electrical permit. You may also need an asbestos inspection, depending on your building’s requirements and any work that requires opening the walls.</span></p>
<h4>Design costs for kitchen renovation</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the design stage, you&#8217;ll collaborate with the professionals you hire, who will create detailed drawings for all the tradespeople to follow. The design will cover details of the room footprint, plumbing, cabinetry, counters, sinks, backsplashes, flooring, lighting, hardware, and appliances. Kitchen renovation design costs will depend on the scope, and also who you hire. In some cases, your Sweeten general contractor will have design experience and will be able to make recommendations and draw up basic plans. For a higher level of service, some general contractors operate full-service design/build firms, with dedicated designers on staff. Some contracting firms also have architects on staff; many can refer an architect. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">If you are considering major layout changes, such as removing walls, rerouting gas or plumbing lines, and rewiring electrical, you are looking at spending at least <b>$32,000</b> for a basic kitchen gut. If you are considering this kind of transformative work, you’ll need architectural designs from a registered architect and to plan for the cost of permits, building approvals, high insurance coverage requirements, and more involved oversight from your general contractor. </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">These “soft costs”—expenses critical to the success of the work but often invisible or unforeseen—can represent 15 to 20% of the total cost of a kitchen renovation.

<h4><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04.png"><img decoding="async" title="cost-estimate-of-demolition-and-site-preparation" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04.png" alt="Cost estimate of demolition and site preparation" width="1080" height="551" class="alignnone wp-image-51063 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04.png 1080w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04-300x153.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04-600x306.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></a></h4>
<h4>Demolition and site prep</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the site prep stage, your general contractor needs to do significant work behind the scenes to ensure that your kitchen renovation maintains its value over time. Old materials and fixtures need to be pulled out and disposed of—this can be complicated on busy city streets with limited parking. Your contractor will probably need to strip the walls and flooring in order to frame and level the room. This step is labor-intensive, typically costing around<b> $4,000</b>. Other site prep includes protecting surfaces and valuables outside the renovation area, fixing any problems discovered within the walls, and adding insulation or waterproofing.</span></p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is the main event. High-quality materials are only as good as the installation—if hinges are not properly aligned on drawers or cabinets, or if the shelving is not completely level, these faults can make the work look shoddy, can make your kitchen harder to use, and can lead to your expensive fixtures aging poorly. Appliances are often installed by the store where you made the purchase (as a built-in cost or an added delivery/installation fee), while countertop suppliers often also manage installation. If installation costs aren&#8217;t included in an item&#8217;s purchase price, they&#8217;ll typically fall under the “general construction” or “labor” budget and be handled by your general contractor.</span></p>
<h3>Behind-the-scenes kitchen renovation costs</h3>
<h4>Overhead costs</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">General contractors always factor in a percentage of the project to cover overhead costs, including insurances, administrative support, and the inevitable costs of growing a business. Sweeten contractors range from two-person crews to firms employing dozens of professionals (including designers, project managers, millworkers, laborers, bookkeepers, and operations staff). No matter the size of your contractor’s business, you will absorb some of the cost increases they bear from year to year.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s6">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span></a><span class="s1"> explained that as a business grows, costs also go up. “Insurances increase yearly, and anything related to MEPs (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) has also increased a bit as these subcontractors—especially plumbers—have seen an increase in their costs.” This is because the rules have become more stringent and there needs to be “more eyes on the project.” Additionally, he mentions, “Buildings are being more stringent on their [insurance] requirements which cause us to keep up with those needs.”</span></p>
<h4>Raw material costs</h4>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, the industry is affected by global trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For 2021, Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as the main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts mainly due to Covid related issues, from what we have seen,&#8221; said <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span>. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;</span></p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions about kitchen renovations in NYC</h3>
<h4>How long does a kitchen remodel take?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anywhere from 3 weeks to 4 months, depending on the complexity of your project. Will you be altering the room’s footprint? Changing or adding electric wiring, plumbing, or gas lines? Ordering custom cabinetry or millwork? Each of these options will add significant time. You may also encounter delays with the city’s permitting process, or with permission from your building’s board. </span></p>
<h4>Do you need a permit to remodel a kitchen?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ll be changing the kitchen’s footprint, making changes to wiring, gas lines, or plumbing, or removing asbestos, you’ll need the appropriate permits from the city. If you live in an apartment building, you’ll almost certainly need approval from the building’s board for any construction work. Discuss with your Sweeten general contractor if they’ll assist with the permit process which is typically 10% of the budget. </span></p>
<h4>How do I remodel a kitchen on a budget?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to make a clear, prioritized list of must-haves and nice-to-haves. Next, you should think about your wishes for appliance quality, quality of materials and fixtures, and overall finish level. Explore scaling back the biggest budget items: footprint changes, changes to wiring/plumbing/gas, custom cabinetry, and millwork, high-end appliances. Your Sweeten general contractor may help find creative solutions—like Ikea cabinets with a similar look to the custom ones you were considering, or ways to accomplish your goals without moving walls. Sweeten recommends setting aside a 10% contingency budget, so you won&#8217;t have to worry about unwelcome surprises.</span> Ready to budget for your NYC kitchen renovation costs?

<p class="schema-faq-answer">The first step is to make a clear, prioritized list of must-haves and nice-to-haves. Next, you should think about your wishes for appliance quality, quality of materials and fixtures, and overall finish level. Explore scaling back the biggest budget items: footprint changes, changes to wiring/plumbing/gas, custom cabinetry, and millwork, high-end appliances. Your Sweeten general contractor may help find creative solutions—like Ikea cabinets with a similar look to the custom ones you were considering, or ways to accomplish your goals without moving walls. Sweeten recommends setting aside a 10% contingency budget, so you won’t have to worry about unwelcome surprises.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a quick overview of budgets for some standard renovation projects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Gut renovation: Starting at <strong>$100</strong> per square foot (psf)<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen remodel: Starting at </span><span class="s3"><strong>$20,000</strong>—<strong>$25,000</strong></span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at </span><span class="s3"><strong>$30,000</strong>—<strong>$40,000</strong></span><strong><span class="s4"> </span></strong><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at </span><strong><span class="s3">$68,000</span></strong><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Budget bathroom remodel: </span><span class="s3">Starting at<strong> $12,000</strong>—<strong>$15,000</strong></span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Starting at </span><strong><span class="s3">$21,000</span></strong> <span class="s5">or <strong>$600</strong> psf.</span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">High-end bathroom remodel and extension: </span><span class="s3">Starting at <strong>$40,000</strong></span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Adding square footage: Starts at <strong>$120</strong> psf<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Total Gut Renovation Costs for a DC Home</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A total gut renovation in Washington DC that brings a home down to its frame and studs could start at around </span><span class="s4"><strong>$100</strong> psf</span><span class="s1">. Doing it all at once will get you the best price per square foot if you are already planning multiple projects. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much does a Washington DC kitchen remodel cost per square foot?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A best-value kitchen remodel typically starts between </span><span class="s3"><strong>$20,000</strong>—<strong>$25,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. This allows the replacement of cabinets and countertops from big-box stores, a stocked appliance package, and tile flooring.<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">For a mid-grade kitchen, expect starting costs between </span><span class="s3"><strong>$30,000</strong>—<strong>$40,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. This pricepoint would include semi-custom cabinets, hardwood floors, upgrade in appliances, and an island (with no sink).<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/washington-dc/"><span class="s2">report</span></a> found the average cost in the Washington DC area costs around <strong>$68,000</strong>. This works out to be <strong>$340</strong> psf. About 60 percent of the cost is recouped in the value it adds to your home. With a budget of this amount, you can remodel a 200-square-foot space with countertops, semi-custom wood cabinets, and a stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet. It also allows the addition of a built-in microwave, dishwasher, and custom lighting. Other than<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/"><span class="s2"> adding a kitchen island</span></a>, the layout, such as where the oven and dishwasher are installed, must remain the same as the original design. Keeping your layout will be the biggest influence in a low budget down.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">For a high-end kitchen remodel, costs start at </span><strong><span class="s3">$68,000</span></strong><span class="s1"> and include a stone or marble countertop as well as opening up the space or removing a wall.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A luxury remodel comes in at an average of <strong>$135,000</strong> for Washington DC, the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/washington-dc/"><span class="s2">report</span></a> found. The psf cost is <strong>$675</strong>. This project can add 58 percent of the budget to your home’s value. A high-end kitchen remodel can consist of custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported ceramic or glass tile backsplashes. The appliances would also kick up a few notches to include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood. The kitchen can also have designer faucets and a water filtration system.</span></p>

<h3></h3>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much does a DC bathroom remodel cost per square foot?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">For a best-value bathroom, expect a typical project to start between </span><span class="s3"><strong>$12,000</strong>—<strong>$15,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. At this budget, it would not be a gut but a refresh.<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A mid-grade bathroom remodel has costs at </span><strong><span class="s3">$21,000</span></strong><span class="s1"> or <strong>$600</strong> psf. These figures come from the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/new-england/boston-ma/"><span class="s2">report</span></a>. For this price,  you can remodel a 35-square-foot bathroom. It includes adding a porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. This renovation can add <strong>$14,000</strong> to a home’s value. That’s 65 percent of the project’s cost.<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A high-end bathroom remodel starts at </span><strong><span class="s3">$40,000</span></strong><span class="s1">. This budget includes a 3 or 4-piece bath such as the sink, shower/tub combination, and toilet. For <strong>$67,000</strong>, a 5-piece bathroom could be installed.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the 2020 Cost Vs Value report, the average price in this category is around <strong>$67,000</strong>. For this price, you can expand your bathroom from 35 square feet to 100 square feet. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/remodeling-a-bathroom-six-trends-to-consider-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new bathroom</a> can have features like a freestanding soaker tub. On top of that, you can have a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. Your budget can also afford a double sink and double-mirror vanity with custom draws and wall cabinets.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding square footage to your DC home </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enlarging living space to an existing floor plan starts at <strong>$120</strong> psf and can easily go up to <strong>$20</strong>0 psf. The most economical addition is adding square footage over a crawl space. An extension where you are adding or adjusting the foundations will come in around <strong>$150</strong> psf. The cost increases to <strong>$200</strong> psf if a wet space—bathroom, laundry, or kitchen—is added. </span><span class="s1">The cost of adding a second floor can start at <strong>$150</strong> psf.  </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Remodeling costs in DC: Permits</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The District of Columbia is a compact city of only 69 square miles. The Council of the District of Columbia issues building permits for this area. Permits cost two percent of the budget for work over <strong>$1,000</strong>. For example, a permit for <strong>$20,000</strong> bathroom will cost <strong>$400</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Prince George’s County, to the east and south of the city, uses an equation for <a href="https://princegeorgescountymd.gov/DocumentCenter/View/23559/DPIE-Fee-Schedule-PDF?bidId="><span class="s2">permit fees</span></a>. <strong>$50</strong> + (Construction Costs x 0.008) = permit fee. So, a <strong>$20,000</strong> renovation would cost <strong>$210</strong>. Watch out for specific fees for projects such as basement finishing which is <strong>$340</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Montgomery County, the area to the north,<a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/DPS/Resources/Files/IT/AllFees.pdf"><span class="s2"> building permits</span></a> for alterations, additions, and repairs start at <strong>$270</strong>.</span></p>

<p>When shopping for cabinets, your lifestyle, plus the materials available, will guide and influence the appearance of your cabinet doors. Do you like the traditional Shaker-style door with its raised frame and crisp edges? Or a sleek flat-front contemporary panel? Are your kids opening and closing doors all day with sticky fingers? Or is your kitchen the entertaining hub of your home, one that you like to keep looking neat for visiting friends and family?</p>
<p>Just about any style of door panel you choose will offer a range of finishes, many of them protective. Here,<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, lays out how to choose the right kitchen cabinets.</p>
<h3>How to choose your cabinet door style</h3>
<p>Most commonly, the door is a flat panel, a raised panel, or a slab front. What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>A raised panel</strong> has a raised rectangular-shaped center and the surface surrounding it is recessed, creating a frame-like appearance. The raised center may be surrounded by other detailing, such as a beveled edge, and/or an arched top, providing a traditional appearance, like antique cabinetry. This style looks beautiful with painted or stained finishes that play up the three-dimensional qualities.</p>

<p><strong>A flat panel</strong> is three-dimensional as well, but the center panel is recessed (though still flat) and framed by two stiles (rectilinear panels at either side) and two rails (panels at top and bottom). This construction is not simply decorative. It was developed (hundreds of years ago!) to keep the door shape stable with fluctuating temperatures and moisture. Popular examples are Shaker and Craftsman style. You can also find some additional variation, with a glass insert that replaces some or all of the center panel (much like a true divided light window), or a beadboard center panel for a country or cottage effect.</p>

<p><strong>A slab front</strong> is made from a single piece of material—solid hardwood, MDF, or a wood veneer. Because it is one surface with no corners or recesses to capture grime, it is easy to keep clean with the swipe of a cloth.</p>

<h3>Cabinet door materials</h3>
<p>Are you warm to wood or is a sparkling white kitchen more your craving? You can find a vast variety of looks in budget, high-end, and luxury cabinets. The rarer the material—think, solid wood—the greater the price tag. Here’s a quick guide to materials from lowest to highest price:</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30487 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above) </em>Custom cabinets with a walnut and mahogany veneer and inset doors in</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-studio-co-op-renovated-for-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Kim and Ian’s kitchen</a></p>
<p><strong>MDF or medium density fiberboard</strong> is manufactured under high pressure and temperatures by combining wood fibers with a resin binder to create door panels as well as the cabinet box. Because this type of material can be manufactured efficiently from wood byproducts, it’s typically the material for stock cabinets. It takes well to paint. Manufacturers will offer different glaze options to apply on top of the paint, so you can still achieve a custom look for a stock price.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36580 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />

<ul>
<li>Thermafoil is a scratch-resistant surface that is thermally glued and vacuum-sealed to MDF. It’s an option in the stock category and great for a lifestyle where the kitchen sees a tremendous amount of activity since it’s easy to maintain. Color choice is limited to white or linen.</li>
<li>Laminate is common in countertops. With laminate cabinets, it’s still a resin-saturated printed paper (commonly a high-res photographic representation of wood) fused to a particleboard or MDF core to create the panel. This offering is available in the stock category.</li>
<li>Veneer cabinets have real wood door panels for less than the price of solid wood. The wood surface here is less than a quarter of an inch and wrapped around an MDF panel for stability—good for areas with high humidity. The risk here is that if the wood is chipped or dinged, you will see the synthetic core, and it can’t be satisfactorily repaired; however, if your cabinets don’t see a lot of hard use, this is a well-priced option in the stock category.</li>
<li>Solid wood is the high-end or luxury category for cabinet doors. Each panel is unique, like the tree it was milled from. The big decision here is what species of wood. The most common are oak, maple, hickory, and cherry. All are hardwoods with a natural beauty and all take stain or paint well. Woods that are prized for their natural color and grain, particularly hickory and cherry, shouldn’t be painted.</li>
<li>Maple is a very hard wood, with a finer grain than oak, so it’s a good choice if you want a perfectly smooth finish for paint and/or glaze. With a clear finish, it takes a contemporary look, and with a deeper stain, it becomes more traditional.</li>
<li>Birch and ash are also durable hardwoods good for kitchen cabinets with more pronounced grains. You may remember pine from your grandma’s days. You can still find this classic, and its knotty grain has a rustic appeal, but as one of the softest woods, it will dent more readily than other species.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation of door styles</h3>
<p>The style of your kitchen cabinetry doesn’t stop with the door design. How the door lays on the box also affects the overall appearance; it’s another decision you will have to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full overlay: Doors (and drawers) cover the front of the cabinet box; hinges are hidden.</li>
<li>Partial overlay: Doors cover just a portion of the face frame; hinges remain concealed.</li>
<li>Inset: Doors are flush with the face frame of the cabinet box; hinges may be concealed or exposed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are the types of kitchen cabinets?</h3>
<p>Your selection process will begin with the door material, as it takes the brunt of the action, swinging open and shut all day, every day. Cabinet doors attach as a cover to the storage compartment they serve to conceal—typically, a box made of wood, plywood, or a wood composite. Construction offered by manufacturers, along with price, is defined by three categories:</p>
<h4>Stock cabinets</h4>
<ul>
<li>$60/ linear foot</li>
<li>Door material: MDF (covered in thermafoil, veneer, or laminate)</li>
<li>Box material: MDF</li>
</ul>
<p>Doors and their boxes come in a limited range of standard sizes. Boxes and doors tend to be made of MDF (medium density fiberboard, which is a composite of sawdust or wood fibers with resin to bind it) and covered in thermafoil, veneer, or laminate. Available from large retailers like Home Depot or Ikea, these cabinets can be good quality but are also the thriftiest choice. Prices vary across the country, starting at about $60 per linear foot and rising to a few hundred dollars, depending on any features you add. Most major manufacturers have a stock line. You may think that there are no options for customization in this category but some brands do offer upgrades such as glass doors or a selection of molding.</p>
<h4>Semi-custom cabinets</h4>
<ul>
<li>$90/ linear foot and up</li>
<li>Door material: solid wood</li>
<li>Box material: MDF or plywood</li>
</ul>
<p>A greater range of sizes and styles according to the manufacturer’s offering. Boxes may be constructed of MDF or plywood. Solid wood doors should be part of the selection, along with MDF and veneers. Expect to pay $90 per linear foot and upward, depending on what organization features or finishes you add on. Find this category at some home centers as well as independent kitchen showrooms that carry national brands offering both semi-custom and custom, such as Wellborn or KraftMaid.</p>
<h4>Custom cabinets</h4>
<ul>
<li>$200 &#8211; $500/ linear foot</li>
<li>Door material: solid wood</li>
<li>Box material: higher quality plywood</li>
</ul>
<p>Built to order to exact size specifications. Boxes tend to be higher-quality plywood and doors are solid wood in a range of species. You may be able to find custom cabinets for under $200 per linear foot, but since everything is made to order to your exact dimensions (and will take longer to arrive at your doorstep, as much as three months, compared to five to six weeks for stock or semi-custom), the price rises considerably. You may pay as much $500 per linear foot and into the thousands for special woods and exterior details. Custom cabinetry is also available from national retailers, such as<a href="https://www.poggenpohl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Poggenpohl</a>,<a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Bilotta</a>, and<a href="https://henrybuilt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Henrybuilt</a>.</p>
<p>As you survey the landscape of kitchen door panels for your cabinets, be sure to ask for samples. You may even be able to borrow a door panel from a local showroom. As with any investment for your home, you will want to try it out before you commit. Hopefully, this Sweeten guide helps you choose the perfect cabinets best suited for your needs and style.</p>
