<p>In the 21st century, an increased awareness around wellness has led renovators and contractors alike to seek ways to turn homes into healing spaces. More knowledge about lighting, paint, non-toxic materials, soundproofing, and heated flooring have helped transform homes into soothing sanctuaries. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, asked some of its contractors and architects the best approaches to bringing a philosophy of wellness and healing into their home renovations.</p>
<h3>Bring in the light</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most affordable way to make your home a healing space is with lighting. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Sean</a> recommended installing dimmer switches on every light fixture. You might have a headache from a day at the office with bright lights, but dimmers allow you to adjust the lighting to your liking in every space. “Coming home should be a sanctuary,” said Sean, who met his business partner at a meditation retreat. Their business is founded on renovating homes for mindfulness, healing, and safety. With dimmers, Sean said it’s important to remember installing the switches will require a master electrician and possibly approval for meeting state codes. After these requirements are squared away, though, you could be coming home to a comfortable ambiance in short order.</p>
<p>When it comes to lighting during the day, windows are key. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5093" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Julia</a> tries to incorporate natural, sustainable materials into homes as much as possible, which includes glass, native plants, and light. You want windows that invite as much natural light into your home as possible. If your windows are on the small side and you’re unable to expand them, there are some creative fixes. Julia has used white epoxy paint and mirrors as reflective surfaces to amplify natural light. Contractor Sean also said he maximizes natural light with mirrors.</p>
<h3>Install radiant heat flooring</h3>
<p>Even the most motivated person might have difficulty leaping out of bed once winter arrives, especially when your feet hit a cold floor. Radiant floor heating is just one way <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Scott</a> said clients feel like they have spent wisely. This cost-efficient way to heat your home provides warmth via electric wires or hot-water tubes hidden beneath the floor. This means no radiators clanking, random heat pockets, or vents with heat surges. An even blanket of heat rises from under your feet, meaning you can turn down the thermostat and reduce heating bills.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37088 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (Above) Sweeten homeowner Christina <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/alcove-studio-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproofed her floors</a></span></p>
<h3>Soundproof walls and floors</h3>
<p>Many New York codes now require <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproofing</a> between floors, and the softening of footfalls can result in other healing side effects—the extra cushion could extend both the life of your floors and your ankles.</p>
<p>Scott said insulation inside walls or on the surface of walls, foam, for instance, can also create a peaceful setting by diffusing outside noise. He added that soundproof windows can help silence everything from garbage trucks to fire sirens. As with all renovations, soundproofing comes with an increased cost based on square footage and labor. The low end of soundproofing walls might increase renovation costs by 5 to 10 percent while the high end could double costs. As for soundproofing floors, Sean gave a range of 10 to 30 percent of an increased expense over a typical floor renovation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Scott&#8217;s clients have been amazed at how healing it can be to keep unnecessary sounds out of their home.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40679 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08.jpg" alt="" width="997" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08.jpg 997w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px" /><span class="img-label"> (Above) Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/mid-century-mad-men-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bathroom renovation</a> with images of nature</span></p>
<h3>Consider the color palette</h2>
<p>The walls could be the next spot to consider for transforming your home. Sean recommended soft, earth tone hues with paints that are low-VOC—or lower in the volatile organic compounds they contain. In some cases, he also employs wallpaper with images of nature. “We can put a garden of birch or cypress in a foyer that can be breathtaking,” Sean said.</p>
<p>Julia has studied Japanese design strategies and recommends minimalism to create an environment that prevents feeling overwhelmed. She likes a focus of one to three colors and offers a reminder that white can be a wise choice to maintain simplicity and enhance mindfulness.</p>
<h3>Think about insulation alternatives</h3>
<p>Feeling safe is essential to being comfortable in your home. Humidity and dampness, especially in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">basements</a>, can create toxic molds. One of the key ways to prevent toxic mold is proper insulation, including in-wall solutions such as MemBrane. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Elizabeth</a> is on the cutting edge of using natural, non-VOC (volatile organic compounds) and non-toxic materials throughout homes. Elizabeth said it might cost a little more for renovators to ensure their home is both environmentally-friendly and safe for their health, but it might not cost as much as they think. “It doesn’t cost twice as much, but it costs a little more,” she said. “I compare it to buying organic foods.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth lists several insulation materials that aren’t harmful: cellulose, rock-wool, denim, mineral wool board, and GUTEX. Rock-wool and denim insulation, she said, are especially easy and low-cost and might lend themselves to DIY. Elizabeth has completely stopped using spray-foam insulation.</p>
<h3>Create efficient cook spaces</h3>
<p>Sweeten general contractor Sean said he ranks the places where we both make our food and eat it as high priorities for creating a healing environment. “We pay special attention to making the kitchen/dining areas, where we nourish and nurture ourselves, into a welcoming space with easy-to-clean, well-lit work surfaces,” he said. “We also encourage the client to choose efficient appliances that keep foods fresh and make quick work of healthy meals and we locate them in the space for the most comfortable, ergonomic layout.”</p>
<h3>Designate a Zen room</h3>
<p>Some people want to create a specific room to serve as a designated sanctuary. In this case, many of the elements highlighted so far can apply to a room for yoga, meditation, or any other restorative activity.</p>
<p>For example, some contractors incorporate elements they’ve used in creating commercial yoga or Pilates studios into the home. When creating a Pilates studio, Julia used natural light to its full effect. After discovering a skylight in the back of the room, she used reflective epoxy white paint on the floors to magnify the abundance of natural light streaming in through the front windows.</p>
<p>Other touches might be used as well. At a yoga studio for children, Scott turned a space behind the building into a grass turf so children could practice yoga comfortably outside.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, Scott said, he wouldn’t have given much thought to the possibility of a peaceful space for yoga or meditation anywhere. &#8220;Now, the option is on his mind constantly. “If a client is comfortable, they feel like they got bang for the buck.”</p>
<p>A healing space can create the right environment that helps well-being carving a new path to your dream home. Said Sean, “If we don’t take this time for self-care, we’re no good to anybody.”</p>
<p>—</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jamie and Chad landed their first place in Ridgewood, countless hours researching DIY methods and hosting “bad first dates” with contractors were not enough help for their Tuscan-tiled master bath.

</a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Jamie, Queens homeowner  </span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My husband and I dreamt of buying a brownstone in Bed-Stuy. This dream was apparently shared by everyone else in New York, because trying to find a place—any place—was a humbling experience in getting outbid by foreign investors and other first-time buyers with resources greater than ours. After a year of frustration, we found a condo in a recently remodeled brick building in Ridgewood, Queens—a quirky little Polish-Ecuadorian neighborhood on the Brooklyn-Queens border that none of our friends had ever heard of. The good news was that the apartment was huge: the building’s original six units had been merged into three, giving us a yard and a finished basement to go with our ground-floor living space.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bad news was that the renovations had been undertaken in an aesthetic that my husband and I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">described as “late-life Euro bachelor”: dark wood fixtures and liberal use of large brown Tuscan tiles that gave certain rooms the yellowish air of an Adirondack rental property you’d regret renting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-17412"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17412 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first year in Ridgewood was dominated by DIY projects—refacing cabinets, painting, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gardening—that improved the overall look of our apartment. The projects that remained were too complicated to be mastered through YouTube videos and trial-and-error, which put us on the market for a contractor to do some larger projects. First in line: our trainwreck of a master bathroom, which when we bought the apartment had been renovated in a very dark (read: creepy) and not-so-functional (read: the showerhead didn’t line up with the tub) way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our search for a contractor stretched over a year. I interviewed people from all over—recommendations from coworkers and friends of friends, names from Brownstoner’s community forum, references in interior design books. There was also Angie’s List, which was effective in introducing me to a series of contractors from Long Island and Brooklyn who were well-versed in bathrooms that featured lots of fogged glass and Jacuzzis—not the bright, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ELLE</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Décor</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-type vibe I was going for. These candidates would generally show up, late and complaining about parking in my neighborhood, then tell me how the fixtures I wanted were going to be too expensive for my budget, how they thought the current bathroom was fine as-is, how I should do a better job training my dogs not to bark.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was like a series of first dates that I knew were going to be awful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somewhere in the process I had read about Sweeten, but let’s be clear: I was far too jaded to be anything but skeptical. I went to their site and decided to </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4383" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of sheer desperation. They first connected me with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my Sweeten general contractor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and from day one, I was impressed. He showed up on time, listened carefully to what I was hoping to achieve, and demonstrated strong attention to detail, noticing things like the slope of the floors and the fact that the recessed lights were out of alignment. He was quick to turn around a quote (some contractors took weeks; others required me to follow up multiple times), and was very responsive to my many emails regarding questions and concerns. I took the leap and hired him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-17413"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17413 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the start, working with Erion and his team was a delight. They showed up promptly at 9am each day, motivated and ready to begin work. And these guys worked hard! I swear, I barely saw them stop to eat! Construction debris and dust is part of the deal when you embark on a project like this, but Erion and his team were extremely tidy and took extra care to protect our house and hardwood floors. Even at the end of demo day, our house was surprisingly clean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part of my experience with Erion was his openness to what I wanted and his tireless pursuit of making this a reality. I wanted a bright, clean, fresh, and timeless space—something that would age well with the house and provide a spa-like atmosphere. This bathroom has no natural light, so I made sure to choose materials that reflected light (beveled mirrors, polished nickel fixtures, high-gloss paint). Erion considered all my sourcing decisions, weighing in where I asked him to and letting me handle things everywhere else. I spent a lot of time researching the fixtures I wanted and although the approach was a bit piecemeal (and largely dictated by stores for which I had gift cards), it worked.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-01.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-17404"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17404" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="luxurious bathroom remodel" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the tile we wanted to keep it light and clean and I worked with the lovely people at Ann Sacks. Their showroom is beautiful, pricing competitive, and customer service exceptional. On the bathroom floor, we chose large marble squares (16 x 16) with a honed finish because it’s not as slippery as polished marble and tends to show fewer scratches. We also decided to install radiant heat to keep our toes warm in winter. For the shower walls, I knew I wanted a larger tile (less grout to clean!) but something with a bit more character than subway tile. At first, I was unsure about going with a handmade 6 x 18 tile because each cut was slightly different, but in the end it turned out beautifully and the hand-made nature of the tile gave it a textured appearance that we absolutely love. As for the shower floors, we did a micro-mosaic which makes me happy every time I look down at it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As unexpected challenges or issues arose—as they always do in remodeling—Erion handled them with a calm demeanor, thoroughly explaining my options and letting me know how they would affect factors such as time and cost. He would talk through the pros and cons of various options and together we would make a decision on how to move forward. At no point did I ever feel steamrolled, or like he was cutting corners. Erion demonstrated an exceptional dedication to quality and was just as concerned as I was that everything be done right and look good. The end result is a beautifully serene space and the sort of justification for all my time and anguish that I’d hoped for.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Postscript: While writing this blog post, our apartment suffered severe water damage from a neighbor’s apartment. The silver lining in this situation is that we knew exactly who to call and who we could trust to do the work. Erion dropped everything to help us navigate this urgent situation, going above and beyond to help us triage damage and map a way forward. He has truly become our technical and professional liaison for maintaining and improving our largest investment, and the confidence I have in his practices, tastes, and commitment to quality cannot be overstated. Thank you, Sweeten, for connecting us.</span></p>
