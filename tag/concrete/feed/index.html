										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>In 2021, bathroom trends are breaking traditional rules about materials, style, and function</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48339 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-13.jpg" alt="Image of black and white geometric wallpaper in powder room" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-13.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-13-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-13-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />In 2020, we looked for a respite from the outside world. We needed to focus on self-care to help us navigate the stress of the pandemic. Enter the bathroom! It was a key spot to take time to ourselves, to relax with a glass of wine and a soak, or to nourish ourselves through daily beauty routines. Naturally, with a renewed focus on the bathroom comes the desire to renovate and refresh. Sweeten sees thousands of renovations a year, and in 2021, these bathroom trends are appearing in more and more homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>2021 bathroom trend: Doorless showers</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21435 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04.jpg" alt="Image of bathroom with walk-in shower " width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Walk right in! Homeowners are forgoing shower doors in their bathroom renovations. It&#8217;s all about the look and feel of the bath, and without a shower door to close off the space; bathrooms can appear larger and more luxurious. It can also help to make the space look fresh and contemporary. (One other upside: there&#8217;s also one less thing to clean!)</p>
<p>In the bathroom above, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovators Kate and Arthur </a>replaced the tub with a wet room—an open shower without curtains or doors—to keep the lines clean and open up the room.  Their Sweeten contractor included a wing wall to keep the water from splashing out. Other Sweeten renovators are following this trend too. Check out Sweeten homeowners, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/an-l-a-bath-remodel-reveals-wet-room-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liz and Kevin</a>, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brownstone-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giulia</a>, who designed their dream baths sans shower doors.</p>

<h3>2021 bathroom trend: Concrete bath counters</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34511 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06.jpg" alt="Image of bathroom with bathtub and concrete counters" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Traditionally, countertops in bathrooms have been ceramic, porcelain, or natural stone. Lately, there has been an uptick in the call for other materials, such as concrete. Concrete is seen as a major selling point as well as a way to modernize a space. It is durable and strong. You will need a fabricator and contractor to install it, however. And it is a bit more pricey than quartz or granite. But many think it&#8217;s worth it for industrial charm. Here, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovators</a> added it to their remodeling plans as a point of interest in their otherwise white bathroom.</p>
<hr />
<h3>2021 bathroom trend: Whimsical wallpaper</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46962 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-13.jpg" alt="Image of black and white geometric wallpaper in powder room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-13-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Wallpaper is a great way to make a statement. It can be dramatic or subdued in color, texture, and pattern. Half-baths are the best candidates for wallpaper with a smaller footprint than a master bath. While many are concerned that steam would be an issue, there are <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wallpaper products made to resist</a> humidity.</p>
<p>Whichever type of bath you are looking to renovate, think about your design style and match it accordingly. These Sweeten renovators selected a black-and-white wallpaper for their powder room. &#8220;I wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all eyes to be on the geometric wallpaper,&#8221;</a> says homeowner Kirsty. &#8220;How could they not be?&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<h3>2021 bathroom trend: Bold and black</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="gold-faucets-fixtures-in-white-bathroom" class="alignnone wp-image-48283 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-After.jpg" alt="bathroom with black walls and floating sink and toilet and gold faucets and fixtures after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-After-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-After-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Color is back and it&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">black!</a> Opposite to what many believe, using a black hue can actually make rooms look bigger because it allows the corners of the room to be undefined. And since they are not defined, it isn&#8217;t easy to tell where the walls start and end. In addition, black has a way of elevating a design. It is sophisticated and really matches any style decor—from contemporary to rustic.</p>
<p>For the bathroom above, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-bath-refresh-from-leaky-to-luxe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovator Veronica</a> decided to embrace the darkness of her space. “The bathroom got very little light to begin with, so I decided to embrace the cave-like atmosphere and go dark.”</p>
<hr />
<h3>2021 bathroom trend: Medicine cabinet comeback</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brown-floating-vanity-black-floor-tiles" class="alignnone wp-image-44077 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-Richardson-blue-tile-bathroom-2.jpg" alt="brown floating vanity and large white sink in bathroom with clear glass shower door and black patterned floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-Richardson-blue-tile-bathroom-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-Richardson-blue-tile-bathroom-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-Richardson-blue-tile-bathroom-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Medicine cabinets used to be a thing of the past. However, today they are enjoying a newfound appreciation. In addition to many providing a mirror, they are great for storage. Homeowners choose them because mirrors are a necessity in the bath, so why not get some extra space for toiletries too? You can get one that is mounted on the wall like the <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/apartment-vs-house-a-brooklyn-family-decides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovator</a> did above. Or, you can have your contractor install an inset one so that the front is <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/88-year-old-master-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flush to the wall.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>It’s versatile, durable, and looks good too</h2>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In renovation and design, there’s always a “hot” material or finish that somehow seems to be on everyone’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sweeten_home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>—and in everyone’s home. Right now, cement is having its moment, and while it may be trendy, the oft behind-the-scenes material is a timeless choice too. These renovators, who came to Sweeten to find general contractors, all used cement in their kitchen and bathroom projects.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38191 size-full" title="concrete walls" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="concrete walls in a bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mix of luxury and raw finishes turned </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/concrete-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karun’s once-crumbling prewar bathroom into an industrial-chic retreat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He wanted to align his bathroom with the rugged-meets-luxe style found in the rest of his home. The edginess of the unfinished, raw cement walls is balanced out with more polished elements such as bronze hardware and Carrara marble tiles.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34511 size-full" title="concrete countertops " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06.jpg" alt="concrete countertops in bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura and Walter’s apartment overhaul</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of their biggest goals was to use natural materials as much as possible. The concrete sink, which they designed and cast themselves, is one such example. In their otherwise traditional white bathroom with walls of subway tile, the concrete and wood sink adds rugged appeal. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Melissa-Flashman-Kitchen-04.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38476 size-full" title="wrap-around-floating-corner-shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Melissa-Flashman-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with flush pull handles and gray countertop with undermount sink and white square backsplash tiles and wrap around floating wooden corner shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Melissa-Flashman-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Melissa-Flashman-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Melissa-Flashman-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Melissa-Flashman-Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/mid-century-scandinavian-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first step to finding</a> (and honing) the light in this Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, kitchen was knocking down a wall. After that, choosing the right materials that reflect and refract natural light took priority. From the glossy, square subway tiles to the matte concrete countertops and floors, the renovator found the right mix of textures and color.</p>

<h3>A closed-off Brooklyn kitchen with potential</h3>
<p>A beautiful neighborhood, an optimal layout, and a lot of natural light led Melissa to purchase her corner apartment in Brooklyn’s Clinton Hill Co-ops. The literary agent planned to renovate the kitchen and remove walls to take advantage of the light from the living area. Melissa also wanted to reflect the building’s mid-century style in her own space. “I wanted mid-century-Scandi-style-kitchen-meets-’70s-Italian-modern with warmer accents in the textiles and color,” she shared. Nearly 14 years after she bought her apartment, Melissa posted her renovation project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>. She was <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with a contractor</a> who helped her bring her kitchen dreams to life. The wait was worth it. (Even <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/scandinavian-white-ikea-kitchen-design-remodel-photos-266002">Apartment Therapy </a>thought so, as they covered the transformation as well!)</p>

<h3>Removing walls to create space in the kitchen</h3>
<div class="desc simple-text tt-content">
<p>Melissa worked with her interior designer, Danielle Herman of Persephone’s Spring, and a Sweeten general contractor to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establish a kitchen plan</a> and open up the space. The walls blocking the kitchen off from the living area were the first to go. Fortunately, the impact was instant: the room immediately brightened up. To take advantage of the newfound light, she chose a mix of materials, including matte <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovation-materials-shine-in-designers-full-home-reno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concrete floor and counters</a>, to balance out the stainless steel appliances. “The goal was to reflect and refract the natural light,” Melissa shared. White Ikea cabinets and floating shelves contribute to the airy and spacious look.</p>
<p>A new peninsula offers additional seating while a built-in nook holds mugs, trinkets, and books. The location of the appliances remained as-is, but without the walls, the cook space <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed a better flow</a>.</p>

<h3>The team brings a Scandi-style kitchen to life</h3>
<p>Melissa’s designer worked hand-in-hand with her Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor executing the vision</a> and selecting finishes, paint colors, and other details.

He provided a detailed breakdown of the job, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget</a>, and timeline, and &#8220;stuck to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her only regret of the project? <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Not doing it sooner</a>. Melissa wakes up every day excited “and delighted to return to cook dinner.”</p>

<p>Often on the wish-list, islands are the perfect kitchen workhorse but don&#8217;t need to look so hard-working. The waterfall style gives this piece of furniture a finishing touch. From wood to concrete, here are seven ideas to pore over.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Storage</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Concrete floors and oak closets transform the former home of a storied local Queens newspaper</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25181 mb-0 size-full" title="living room and kitchen with concrete floors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02.jpg" alt="concrete floors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michael and Chenta had been looking for a new place for about six months when they visited a duplex apartment in the former home of the Ridgewood Times, a local newspaper of record in the area. They fell in love with the space and saw a lot of potential in it. The creatives—Michael designs sweaters and Chenta is a director in web design—were drawn to a warm but minimalist look, and knew immediately how they could alter the apartment to achieve their desired surroundings. The prewar industrial building was situated in Ridgewood, Queens, right on the border of Brooklyn, and dated back to 1932. It also briefly housed a school, and then was converted to condos in 2009. The structure&#8217;s original industrial elements, including steel beams and wood materials, concrete floors, high ceilings, and great expanses of windows, were preserved in the conversion. The space was everything that Michael and Chenta were looking for, with an interesting history to boot.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While they were in contract on the property, Michael and Chenta began reaching out to general contractors independently, but felt overwhelmed. They would call contractors and hear nothing back. Michael then <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/12757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project</a> to Sweeten’s site, explaining they wanted to reveal the concrete floors under beaten-up hardwood planks, and to create a new closet system for the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/designers-concrete-floors-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master suite</a>. The couple was matched with several experts, and ultimately decided on their Sweeten general contractor. The contractor and her team worked with the duo to achieve the right combination of concrete, wood, metal, and paint colors to produce what Michael called a “modern Scandi style, but without the Boho elements.” They wanted “clean and simple lines, but we&#8217;re also trying to not make it look too cold or sterile.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25192 size-full" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-02.jpg" alt="before" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25181 mb-0 size-full" title="living room and kitchen with concrete floors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02.jpg" alt="concrete floors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of the biggest changes, the contractor’s team first ripped up the wood flooring to expose the concrete floors underneath on both levels of the duplex. They next applied an Italian product called Wall2Floor, a concrete-based mineral coating that had to be applied by hand to the existing substrate. The application creates a seamless surface and is usually used in luxury spaces. It gave the apartment floor a polished, sleek texture and paired nicely with the wooden banister and kitchen cabinets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To continue the streamlined effect, Michael and Chenta asked their Sweeten contractor to remove baseboard moldings and door frames. This accentuated the gallery-like feel of the loft space: walls were floated—meaning that the drywall stops short of the floor, and is not covered with base moldings, and when closed, doors were completely flush with the walls that surrounded them. Their choices of warm white paint in the living area and dusty pink in the living room provided a warm contrast against wood, metal, and concrete.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the master suite, they made layout changes to accommodate a walk-through (rather than walk-in) closet. The existing closets on the left wall were demolished, and a floating wall was created to section off the closet area without closing it completely. “It’s all very open with a lot of natural light,” Michael explained. New custom closets were designed with metal framed interiors and floor-to-ceiling oak doors and placed to face the new wall. They also opted to paint the walls inside the closets dark gray for more depth. All the hardware was finished in a matte black. “We didn’t like any of the standard finishes, so our contractor made the changes to help us achieve the clean lines and simplicity that we were looking for,” said Michael.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25189 mb-0 size-full" title="concrete floors and stairwell" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07.jpg" alt="concrete floors" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, Michael and Chenta worked with their Sweeten team to ensure that each step was smooth. But like many renovations, there were some hiccups: they had to move in before the renovation was finished since they didn’t want to continue paying rent when they had started paying their mortgage. They waited until the concrete floors were finished (and protected with a plastic sheet), and then <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lived through the rest of the work</a>. “All our moving boxes were stacked in the middle of the living room, and we were sleeping on an airbed in a construction site,” describes Michael. Despite this, the couple felt that their contractor “was great from the beginning. She understood our vision and always had great ideas. She was the kindest person and talked us thoroughly through the process, even when Chenta and I had meltdowns.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michael’s advice to would-be renovators? “Stay calm and put some money aside. It will work out in the end, but you will be over budget. It was a system that we weren’t familiar with, and although I understand how to create a product, I didn’t realize just how complex it would be to renovate an apartment. It takes so many steps to even properly <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paint</a> a wall! And all these little things need to be done to create a great end result, although they seem unnecessary when you are not familiar with the process.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tile revamps ho-hum walls and floors in an instant—from tile flooring to backsplash tile.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22453 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg" alt="Geometric tile backsplash" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Geometric tile backsplash in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet&#8217;s Crown Heights kitchen</a><span class="img-label"> .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are, your home has tiles somewhere—the bathroom and kitchen, or maybe a foyer or mudroom. While they serve a practical purpose—waterproof, easy to clean, protects surfaces—tiles have now emerged as a pivotal element in taking a space from flat to fabulous! Look to tile as a style and even a fashion choice, as manufacturing advances such as high-definition (HD) printing and slip-resistant finishes help to create a personal statement on floors, as well as walls. Consider these five trends:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Faux effects</h3>
<p>Improvements in HD printing have translated to tile with highly realistic interpretations of natural materials like wood and stone, as well as concrete, plaster, and metal. And the options don’t stop there. In addition to the oak or walnut look, these woods are coupled with different finishes and treatments—pickled, distressed, reclaimed (with the faux paint still intact), sustainable alternatives to exotic hardwoods like a mirror-polished cherry or mahogany that you might previously have found only in a palace or a yacht. This tile also lets you take “wood” where you previously might not have&#8230;inside a shower, for instance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for stone, you can install a luxurious-looking faux marble for your entire bath at a tenth the cost of the real thing, and without the habitual upkeep, such as sealing. No need to worry about scratches or water or wine stains with glazed porcelain. Why not combine a faux-wood and a faux-stone look in a bath? Most tile comes 3/8-inch thick, so it’s easier to combine these looks in tile than to align the differing heights of real wood planks with marble slabs on a floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a more industrial look for, say, a loft or home office, check out faux concrete in a super-size, like 24” x 24”—again, without the need to seal and with no risk of cracking, like poured concrete. If you crave color but don’t want those glossy 4” x 4” squares you remember from the school washroom, look for porcelain tiles that mimic encaustic cement tiles, with their luscious hues and patterns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Add various textures</h3>
<p>As described above, faux effects are achieved from highly realistic HD printing. Textures are also now being incorporated during the manufacturing process. Some faux weathered wood porcelain tile includes the dings and saw marks you’d expect to find in reclaimed planks, minus the splinters!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brick is making a comeback too, and with the introduction of faux brick tile comes a realistic pebbled surface. Consider paving your entryway with this tactile material—a perfect crossover from the outside in. Colored glazes in myriad choices give this brick fresh, contemporary appeal, and can provide a touch of texture to a space where a neutral color dominates like a shower or backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also expect to find tile with finishes that resemble fabric, from nubby linen to lace to fine twill. These styles look especially warm underfoot, and bring sophisticated depth when used on walls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Consider three-dimensional</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, 3D tile was very popular in those cool mid-century houses that were never renovated. If it was ever on your wishlist, you likely had to pay a lot for something that was hand cast or, alternatively, rough around the edges (literally). However, the demand for 3D has risen among designers for hotels and restaurants, and homeowners are now reaping the results. Manufacturers offer lots of interesting sculptural surfaces, from shallow recesses that resemble waves or indentations worn into stone by water to alternating raised and recessed hexagons to abstract and organic shapes that seem to spring from their surfaces. These tiles are good for feature walls and vertical areas, such as hallways that transition from one room to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Beyond basic shapes and patterns</h3>
<p>The hexagon is one of the more popular shapes to appear in kitchens and baths; it combines graphic interest with a classic outline, providing a strong motif around which you can play with size and color. One manufacturer created a wall tile with alternating rising and recessed discs. The 3” x 6” subway tile is seeing a renaissance, and reinterpreted in a thinner and longer dimension like 2” x 10” or even 2” x 20”. The rectilinear shapes lend themselves to a lot of different patterns when installed, like herringbone, chevron, and the running bond as an alternative to the traditional stacked. If you’re in the market for something more sensual, consider an arabesque-shape tile. Smaller versions will work on the floor, where the grout lines prevent slipping; it also makes a pretty backsplash or wall behind a vanity in a master bath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Choose your size</h3>
<p>If you’ve visited a tile store lately, you’ve probably noticed tiles are getting, well, bigger. Rectangular shapes can be found twice as wide as you may be accustomed to, such as 12” x 24”. Squares, too, have doubled in size, from 12” x 12” to 24” x 24”. Besides their fashion-forward appearance, there are several additional benefits: these larger sizes or formats actually make a small space, such as a bath, appear larger. There’s also fewer grout lines, which means faster installation and easier upkeep. However, the size trend doesn’t stop there. Designers are mixing sizes to create interesting effects, and you can, too. Combine wide and narrow wood planks, for instance, to achieve a custom effect, or alternate four small squares with one large square in the same size.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>A word about grout</h3>
<p>A decade or so ago, most tile installations used a white or off-white grout. It was adequate to blend into the tile’s appearance and still show the pattern. Now you can choose from dozens of colors to match your selection. Contrasting grout, however, has caught on, particularly with subway and other rectangular formats, to get a more graphic effect or to emphasize the shape of the tile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8212;<br />
Your choice in tile can influence the entire space it occupies. Here is how <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arthur and Kate</a> used stacked patterns in minimalist fashion, while <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kellys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-sweeten-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kelly</a> went bold with cement tile on the floor but subtly glamorous on the wall. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet’s</a> geometric backsplash become the kitchen’s centerpiece, while <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua’s</a> subtle 3D tile struck a perfect balance.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Each week, we aim to translate insight from Sweeten experts into information you can use to make better decisions about improving your home. This week and next, let&#8217;s take on flooring. I might be biased, because new floors were the very first step I took in renovating my tiny East Village apartment, but I cannot possibly think of a better way to get a bigger bang for your buck. If you are looking to transform the way your home feels, you can do it with new floors in less than a week&#8217;s time. For proof of its impact, scroll through these flooring selections some of our favorite homeowners have made in the last year. <em><strong>Next week, check back for the full low-down on the process and cost of re-doing your floors.</strong></em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Williamsburg, <a href="https://sweeten.com/2013/10/31/katie-elliots-williamsburg-townhouse-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katie and Elliot renovated</a> with Mirage Knotty Walnut floors throughout the first floor of their townhouse. The natural knots and irregularities serve as a counterpoint to the clean cabinet lines and modern lighting fixtures. I&#8217;m always amazed at how<span id="more-11520"></span> simple white walls set against warm wood tones makes a space feel clean, bright, and relaxed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11527 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Kyle and Angela replaced their Clinton Hill parquet with white oak, left unstained. The simple color and texture of the new floors is such a smart complement to the custom walnut millwork, saturated green accents, and mid-century modern decor that makes this home so unique.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11522 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_AMarch-42ndStCombo-1000w.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_AMarch-42ndStCombo-1000w.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_AMarch-42ndStCombo-1000w-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Hell&#8217;s Kitchen, a homeowner combining three apartments unified the space with a custom engineered white oak floor from Master Floor, an Italian company. The planks are pre-finished with a matte effect, which keeps your eye focused on these incredible views and amplifies natural light throughout the apartment without adding any glare.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11536 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-05.jpg" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-05-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11528 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_01.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="340" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_01.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_01-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen of their Brooklyn row house, Allison and Jovito chose a porcelain tile, finished to look like wood. For extra visual impact, they laid the tile in a herringbone pattern. Porcelain was an especially smart choice for these cat owners: tile is more durable than softer wood materials and is easy to keep clean in a high-traffic area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11537 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-111.jpg" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-111.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-111-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_04.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11531 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_04.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="340" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_04.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_04-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Chelsea, this homeowner, an architect and designer, kept the wood floors that were original to the iconic London Terrace building but transformed them with a matte black finish. The decor choices throughout this apartment are so glamorous &#8211; this dark matte finish helps diversify the feel and gives a little bit of grit and texture to the space.</p>
