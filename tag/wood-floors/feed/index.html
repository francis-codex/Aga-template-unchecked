<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural, versatile, timeless&#8230;wood floors can last for decades or even generations. But if there&#8217;s damage after years of wear, or the stain just isn&#8217;t suited to your style, replacing them may be your best bet for safer and better-looking floors. Ahead, we share five reasons Sweeten homeowners decided to replace hardwood floors and revitalize their spaces.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Improving the overall home design</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35230" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-07.jpg" alt="home renovation, living room renovation, open floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-07-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With low ceilings at just a little over eight feet high, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maggie and Adam worked to create an illusion</a> of a taller height. A ceiling plan for each room was planned out by the couple. This included narrow interior doors, white walls, colorful art, and 7-inch wide hickory flooring throughout.</span></p>
<h3>Adding soundproofing to floors</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36986 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08.jpg" alt="Murray Hill living room renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>When Christina decided to renovate her studio co-op in Murray Hill, the building requested that she <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/alcove-studio-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">install a layer of soundproofing</a>. Even if soundproofing isn’t mandated, it can add a layer of ease and “acoustic comfort” to your space. And, Christina pointed out that the installation process isn’t as bad as you might think. About replacing her floors, she said: “the entire removal and installation was surprisingly a relatively fast process.”</p>
<h3>Repairing subfloor water damage</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35603 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17.jpg" alt="This homeowner replaced water-damage flooring for light, wooden oak floorboards" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
In Sherry&#8217;s midtown apartment, the wood floors <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/millennial-apartment-renovation-midtown-east/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suffered from water damage</a>.  A previous tenant had left the windows open for weeks when Sherry&#8217;s family rented the apartment out. When she was ready to move into the space, she changed out the damaged floorboards for sleek, new oak wide-paneled wood flooring.</p>
<h3>Replacing uneven (and noisy) hardwood floors</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38259 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792.jpg" alt="Warm red oak wooden floors replace the once uneven, creaky wood flooring in this city apartment" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />When Katie and Marcus&#8217; bought their apartment, they knew they&#8217;d have to replace the noisy and uneven wood floors. Their contractor started to rip open the floorboards, only to find there was no subfloor. He worked to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/replacing-wood-floors-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add in new subflooring and soundproofing</a> and replace the floors. They decided on a warm red oak that complements the exposed brick fireplace.</p>
<h3>Reflecting more natural light</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37459 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a.jpg" alt="Replacing wood floors with a lighter stained wood adds a light and airy vibe to this Manhattan space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Sometimes, the best reason to make a change is the simplest: because you want to. A Manhattan couple decided <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/kips-bay-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replacing wood floors with a lighter finish</a> would give their space a brighter look. Their designer helped refresh their space by painting the walls a warmer white hue and by adding translucent drapes to let in more natural light.</p>

</ul>
<h3>A home with potential</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s incredible what you can do to a house without knocking down a wall. We had to look beyond a lot of challenges, 40-year-old decor, </span><span class="s1">an antiquated electrical system, and thin, stained wooden floors. But we saw something we could work with.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42954 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait.jpg" alt="renovators on couch with dogs" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43007 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior.jpg" alt="exterior 1920s house remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house had a great layout. We loved the open first floor, with its nine-and-a-half-foot ceilings and perfect flow—the foyer, living room, and dining room were all open but the spaces were distinct. The second floor lacked overhead lighting and had wood paneling in every room, but was accessed by a beautiful staircase. Potential! We knew we could make it modern while preserving its ‘20s spirit.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42944 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors.jpg" alt="Black double French doors, living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42945 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway.jpg" alt="remodeled foyer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Hidden architectural designs</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not that it would be easy. The family we bought the house from had owned it for 34 years and it had a very retro feel. We hoped that the layers of carpet and wallpaper might conceal architectural delights, but were disappointed that the few special details we uncovered, like parquet inlays, were beyond salvaging.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We knew that foundational work would eat most of the budget, with the floors and walls requiring considerable attention.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The initial scope that we listed out for Sweeten offered a basic overview of our project, listing last: “</span><span class="s3">Inspect/clean electrical panel.” We mentioned the possible need to replace or expand it, but didn’t realize how much work it would actually require. Finding out that we needed to replace all of the wiring</span><span class="s1"> was one surprise that our renovation served up. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We scheduled walk-thoughs to see the work at various stages, including&#8230;the electrical portion. Seeing exactly what had been done before the walls were closed up was informative and reassuring.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42951 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3.jpg" alt="living room renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Combining the old with new</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We didn’t move or remove a single wall but we did add French doors in the foyer to create a barrier to summer heat and winter cold. Because most of the first floor is open concept, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interior doors help to keep</a> the temperature even and comfortable year-round, while also creating a dramatic entry into our living space. [See more <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/home/photo-gallery/45749027/image/45749041/Modern-Meets-Country">inspiring living rooms here</a>.]</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">One of our goals was to build in details that appeared original. Where we could, we blended the old with the new that included a molding update. We complemented the existing molding on the stairs with new molding on the adjacent wall. </span><span class="s1">Our contractor matched the living room ceiling to the dining room’s original trim and a ceiling medallion was installed, a hint at deco design. It was in this room that the house finally gave us a gift. Our contractor unearthed a window hidden inside the dining room exterior wall—a lovely find that, with some attention, brought us a lot more light.</span></p>

<h3>Choosing the materials</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We stripped, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skim coated</a>, and painted the walls and redid two bathrooms investing in materials that would last. New floors were installed, windows were repaired, and energy-efficient ductless AC went throughout the house. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house felt instantly spacious and bright. The two things we were looking for in every choice we made: quality and classic style. From flooring and tiles to paint and different types of fixtures, we chose finishes we knew would last and look good for decades. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our color scheme, like everything else, is stark, graphic, and, most importantly, bright. White with the occasional swath of black feels timeless and pulls together everything from the foyer to the upstairs bath. A discreet beach vibe is there for those who look—low-key seashell references are hidden in a few small spots, a nod to the fact that we&#8217;re a 25-minute walk from Marine Park.</span></p>

<h3>Getting things done to code</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We wound up doing nearly twice as much work and extending our schedule to four times the original plan. We spent a little over $120,000, including materials, a four-month apartment rental, and contractor costs. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">We were scrupulous about everything being done to code. Our Sweeten contractor had great communication skills and sent updates, photos, and videos via WhatsApp. We scheduled walk-throughs to see the work at various stages, including the point when the electrical portion was complete. Seeing exactly what had been done before the walls were closed up was informative and reassuring. As a civil engineer, Luke was heavily focused on ensuring that the electrical, plumbing, and structural elements were sound.</span></p>

<h3>An extensive renovation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This renovation taught us a lot! It wasn’t our first experience, but our biggest by far. We used many subcontractors, including electricians, HVAC specialists, plumbers, hardwood flooring installers, and plaster experts, and asked a lot of questions about the best processes, the ideal order for tasks, and how to complete them on a reasonable schedule. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The best part of the renovation? Seeing the “after” months later, after being so overwhelmed by the “before”! We didn’t gut the house, but we came close. The difference is dramatic. We are absolutely thrilled.</span></p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Welcome to #5 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating and answer questions we hear on a daily basis! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new queries, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance.</em></p>
<p><em>Feel free to email me at <strong><a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a></strong> with any reno questions or dilemmas you&#8217;d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Are wood floors a good investment?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>With so many flooring choices available, everyone can express their own sense of aesthetics. The reason why wood floors make a good investment as a type of material is their versatility. They allow you, or the next owner, to sand them down and restain or refinish them. Obviously, you could pull up an existing carpet and start over again, or you could re-tile, but wood floors allow you the capability of refinishing the same wood surface which makes them a very attractive option. When I&#8217;m asked the best way to transform a space on a budget, my answer is to redo the floors. This can change every square foot of your home, with one renovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">A loft apartment rediscovers its historic roots by exposing its beams, maximizing 11-foot ceilings, and bringing the walls down</span></h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Meg and Brett had grown comfortable with their rental—despite its tiny shower, inadequate climate control, and chronic water problems—but dreamed of something to call their own. Having searched for years without success, they finally landed on just the thing: a spacious loft apartment in Hamilton Heights with a history. They went to work restoring some of the industrial charm that previous owners had plastered over with drywall, and the result is a stunning combination of original wooden beams, salvage finds, and touches of warmth that make an apartment a home. Read on for Brett’s take on how he worked with Sweeten to create the ideal space for his growing family.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24990 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Hamilton Heights homeowner Brett</span></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had been renting in NYC in different neighborhoods for many years, including most recently, our rental of eight years at the corner of 63rd Street and 2nd Ave. We loved our rental, but it had its share of problems&#8230;it would heat up like an oven in the summer, and in winter, it was so cold we could see our breath in the living room. It flooded every other year, and we could hear honking almost 24/7. It was imperfect but it was comfortable, and we loved it. We thought about purchasing a place for many years, but every apartment we looked at was a step down from where we were. Then we found it…the perfect place in the perfect neighborhood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">&#8230;after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment! </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment we found was an 1,800-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath condo loft in the historic district of Hamilton Heights. In an old carriage house that had been converted to residential lofts, the building was one of the few remaining carriage houses left in the city. We can track its existence back to 1903 from old ads in the Tammany Times, but I am sure it was built before then.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The place had been renovated not too long ago and was finished nicely. It had everything we ever wanted, and had we moved in as is, it would have been a huge step up from our current place. Most people would have moved in and not changed a thing. Our friends, our parents, and our brokers all thought we were crazy to even touch it. But after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as our vision was concerned, we wanted our loft apartment to feel high-end, but not stuffy or fancy. It should have a modern and clean feel to it, while still being classic and forever. We wanted to feel like we were on vacation when we were at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This place had a lot of history and interest to it, but we felt that the previous owner covered up a lot of the historical aspects, and aimed to expose them literally and figuratively. We describe it as smashing-a-modern-apartment-into-a-barn because that is kind of what we did. Attention wasn&#8217;t paid to trends, design rules, or motifs. We picked what we liked, and things that would be forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love watching &#8220;<a href="https://youtu.be/t221YNSCFLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open House&#8221; NYC</a>, our normal weekend activity, and saw an ad for Sweeten come on. Knowing that work needed to be done on the place, we thought of this as a good sign and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/8578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed up on the site</a>. Looking through their bios and past work, we found a few contractors who we were matched with that we liked. After speaking to three on the phone, there was a good feeling with one Sweeten design/build firm. His pictures showed he could do nice work, and he seemed like a straight shooter. We met with him at his office and got a quote on the scope of work. My wife and I liked the Sweeten contractor and felt him to be honest. We never got another quote or met with another contractor. His price wasn’t cheap but I didn’t want cheap work. I wanted someone I knew would do the job right.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I discovered during this renovation that developers will often square things off and use preset sizes for things to make the job easier and cheaper. After we did some demo, we found a ton of extra storage space just behind the sheetrock in the kitchen—and built an 8-foot-tall <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry</a> into the wall to the left of the fridge. Don’t be afraid to knock a few holes in walls. It’s all going to be painted anyway. After all, ours ended up being floor-to-ceiling in the kitchen which rivals most suburban pantries. Lastly, we recessed all the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a> except pendants over the peninsula, which we replaced with classic handblown Simon Pierce light fixtures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the exposed brick in the living room—which had 11-foot-high ceilings—and looked to continue the theme. We walked around and knocked on the drywall—if it felt hollow, we put a hole through to see what was underneath. This method allowed us to find original beams and columns all over the apartment and expose them. The wooden beams were original to the carriage house, whereas the iron beams were installed to support the original structure at some point in the building’s history. Some of the beams had initials in them, and we even found a horsehair or two caught in the wood!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wood-burning fireplace was originally wrapped in an ugly stone, so we wrapped it in black steel and replaced the mantle with a natural soapstone. Behind the fireplace, we built a niche for all the electronics and hung a TV above the mantel. We stripped the yellow varnish off the wide-plank oak <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a> throughout the loft apartment and refinished them with an eco-friendly, non-toxic, two-stage fuming process. The ceiling was painted the color of the sky—Benjamin Moore Grey Sky—and recessed LED lighting was added. A large custom table was built for the space by RE-CO Brooklyn from a single tree that fell during Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I found the tall ladder in the boiler room of an old factory in the Bronx. I work for a company that owns a few buildings in Hunts Point, and there are generations of industries and companies that have come and gone in those buildings. In my downtime, I like to explore the old abandoned spaces. Sometimes you can find the coolest stuff if you aren’t afraid to get a little dirty. The ladder was blackened from the fumes and probably at least 40 years old. I sanded it down and now use it to reach for items and to add some vertical interest. For the plant hangers, I used various industrial parts I found at a supply store to create a way to attach and hang plants to the beam.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, we went for a classic look: white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> with Carrara marble countertops and backsplash, with pulls and knobs in silver. The original kitchen cabinets had a shiny yellow wood finish that was not our style, so they were stripped down and painted in a nice white. Various sections were distressed to better fit the style of the loft apartment. The counters and backsplash are 3.5-inch-thick Carrara marble—the distributor said it was too hard to deliver and install such a thick piece in one slab because of the weight. But we insisted and they had to use 10 men to bring it in and install it! We also enlarged the sink with a Kohler stainless steel model. The range is a Bertazzoni Pro. Next to the sink is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mini-fridge</a> that is stocked with the same items you would find in a hotel mini-fridge—even things I don’t like!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, in the master bath, we went with a large 4-inch <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hex tile</a> in Carrara marble, with a simple white subway tile on the walls to match. I found our sink at an old steel warehouse in the South Bronx—it was filled with debris and pigeon poop at the time but was in surprisingly good shape. It’s a 48-inch Kohler slop sink circa 1948, and our Sweeten contractor was able to create a custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> underneath to fit the unusual shape of the sink. Our contractor also custom-made the mirror above to match.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the kitchen, we found space behind walls in the bathroom and created three linen closets. This room also holds the thing that I’m most excited about in the whole renovation: the shower. It’s spacious and comfortable—I had to duck down to get into our old shower and I’m only 5’8” on a good day. My wife’s favorite thing about the entire renovation is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer/dryer</a>! I didn’t even have to ask what it was…at our old building, the washing machines looked so old, I swear they ran on steam power. Clothes would come out dirtier than when they went in.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom, we redid the floor-to-ceiling closets with custom wooden doors and hid a TV inside. We also added custom wood shutters to the windows, which accentuate the unique shape of the windows. They are super deep, tall and arched. Without many good options, we concluded this was the best way to address the arch without ruining the architectural interest of the windows. As for the rest of the bedroom, it feels very serene and relaxing. Sleep is important to my wife and me, and we wanted it to feel like a retreat from the city. We didn&#8217;t want any industrial elements in here. We wanted it to feel refined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the entire process, our Sweeten contractor stayed on budget, which was very important to us. He completed the project within the time frame we discussed, even though I kept adding more and more work. He was pleasant to work with and fixed every concern or problem I brought up. Even after the project was complete, he repeatedly checked in and fixed a problem or two that was missed during the renovation. Now that we’re done, I’d say that the hardest part was staying on budget with a project of this scope. We kept finding more things that we wanted to do. My advice to future renovators is to anticipate this and to make a list of things that need to be perfect. Don’t be afraid to move backwards or sideways. Better to take your time, and get what you want than rush and end up with something subpar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">A developer&#8217;s dark style is transformed by its new owner with high-gloss cabinets, drawers turned sideways, and a comfy window seat</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24340 mb-0 size-chrono" title="window seat" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-Portrait-723x1085.jpg" alt="window seat" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</b></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redesign a kitchen</a> with a bright sheen in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: There was much to love about the two-bedroom condo in Bed-Stuy that Ursula, a math teacher, recently purchased. The developer, who had just converted a brownstone into four apartments, did a good job. However, the brand new kitchen just wasn’t her style. The dark mahogany cabinets and kitchen island weighed it down as did the floorboards of a similar color. The cabinets above the range also gave the space a claustrophobic feel. “The developer seemed to have an imagination when it came to painting. The walls were blue and yellow and very specific to his taste,” said Ursula.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>After</b></span>: Since her new apartment only has windows on the front and back, Ursula used <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, <span class="s1">a free service matching homeowners with general contractors to </span>tap her Sweeten contractor and harness that light. So out went the dark cabinets. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wood floors</a> were stripped and restained. To open up the kitchen, the cabinets and microwave above the range were out, too (“it just isn’t a pretty appliance,” said Ursula, speaking of microwaves). In their place is now a sleek <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hood</a>. With the space more open, the hexagonal tiles chosen for the backsplash became a focal point. “I think it must be the math teacher in me, but there is just something about them that I love,” she said. A &#8220;dresser&#8221;-style <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island</a> features three drawers for silverware, cutlery, dishes, and some pots and pans. &#8220;My beech cutting board is always on top of the kitchen island for food prep,&#8221; says Ursula. &#8220;It is conveniently in front of the oven, so I just have to turn around to cook.&#8221; The storage unit&#8217;s glossy gray tone offers contrast to the mostly white space. Her Sweeten contractor also utilized every inch of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinet space</a> including a stubborn area next to the oven. There, a drawer installed on its side—a cabinet wouldn&#8217;t fit—became a convenient <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pull-out spice rack</a>. As for the microwave, a much smaller one is hidden in the upper cabinets.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: Ursula&#8217;s Sweeten contractor used the same kitchen cabinet system from Ikea to create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bench seat</a> near the window. Now, there’s more storage space and extra seating for when guests come over. “That&#8217;s one of my favorite areas in the apartment because it is a little unexpected,” she says. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s dispatch comes from the interior designer of a New York City apartment re-do. Samantha was brought on to help modernize a client’s apartment, and while she was up for leading the ambitious design needs, she needed help finding a general contractor who could execute beautifully on the plans. Her client had filled his home with art and travel finds over the course of four decades in the space, and what started as a “refresh” project evolved into a total apartment renovation to create a light and bright canvas for treasured pieces and cherished friends. </span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Samantha Stein, Interior Designer</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stars aligned when a good friend put me in touch with a potential client I’d known for years. Ron, the homeowner, had been living in the same Upper East Side post-war apartment for 40 years (!) and was ready for some interior changes to freshen it up. We met to discuss priorities and a design vision, and then turned to Sweeten for help choosing a contractor for </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were able to use Sweeten’s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">network to narrow our contractor choice down to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1458#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one firm</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which was experienced and great to work with. They had a reasonable price for our initial wish list, and after we began working with them, we grew more comfortable expanding into more custom solutions and additional scope, for what would ultimately become a full gut renovation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, the theme of the renovation was a relatively minimal ‘refresh’ &#8211; new paint, strip and refinish floors, clean-up details such as the custom five inches of crown molding in the living room, add custom millwork covers for the old and dilapidated radiator units, and complete a full renovation of the very outdated kitchen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18494 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18493" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron, the client, wavered back and forth about updating his traditional apartment into a more modern space with an open-concept living and kitchen area. Ultimately, however, his classical taste and the way he uses the apartment in his daily life led us to leaving an enclosed kitchen, but updating its finishes and changing a few details to make the whole living area feel larger and flow more seamlessly. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We removed both doors to the kitchen in favor of open entryways, demolished the two china cabinets that were edging into the dining space, and intended to continue the existing parquet into the kitchen. But, the more we discussed matching the existing parquet in rooms that had either outdated carpeting or badly damaged linoleum, the trickier it seemed it would be to get the clean, flowing feeling that Ron was looking for. After weighing costs and options with George&#8217;s team, we decided that going with a wide-plank engineered wood throughout the entire apartment (with the direction of the planks leading your eye out to the living room windows) was the right solution for a cohesive, flowing apartment. Ripping out the parquet allowed us to fully level and soundproof the subfloor, as well as fully waterproof the kitchen area. Great sighs of relief went up all around when the 40+ year old parquet and carpeting pieces were hauled out, and the textured wood floors (supplied by Glen Floors) look fantastic. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron has a fabulous lifelong collection of china, music, and incredible books on art, music, and travel that were hiding around the apartment. So, one of the top priorities for the renovation was storage. Curating a selected display of these items felt to me the best way to celebrate his travels and life experiences – they should be an integral part of the apartment without looking kitschy or messy. I had originally proposed a huge built-in wall of custom shelving and cabinetry, but pricey bids from other contractors made us step back. Once we started with George&#8217;s team, however, we felt confident we could bring back this concept to make up for the lost kitchen/dining storage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We drew inspiration from several interiors that featured shelving surrounding a ‘nook’ for the sofa, and Michael and Dennis were able to help us flawlessly execute this vision with a stunning custom piece. The weight of the real wood doors, soft-close hinges, adjustable shelving, and hardware we selected from Nassau Suffolk Hardware make it all fit in perfectly—it’s hard to believe it wasn’t there before. We added two brass sconces from Ralph Lauren Home to softly light the sofa area at night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18497 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03.jpg" alt="dark wood floors" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> </span><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18498" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04.jpg" alt="traditional dining table" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen was where the majority of the hard work happened. Our expert team was able to match my every demand. We re-centered the sink on the windows, removed a dropped ceiling section just above the windows, and gained upper cabinets by replacing the double wall ovens with a more conventional range. We saved a ton on appliances with some lucky timing with a big sale at Thermador, and chose a refrigerator, gas range, recirculating hood, and dishwasher from their Professional Series line. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The custom cabinets, again made from real wood, fit perfectly and are of incredible quality. We ordered the Kohler sink from Wayfair and the Rohl faucet from Nassau Suffolk Hardware. Our experts helped us choose Caesarstone quartz countertops instead of a pricier granite or marble, and we are impressed with their quality. Under-cabinet lighting and a few LEDs above the sink, in addition to the overhead fixture, make for lots of different ways to light the kitchen at night. The kitchen alone makes the entire apartment feel new and fresh, and its traditional accents (crown molding and the custom bevel on the countertops) keep it in the same design family as the rest of the apartment. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bedroom and living room, we carefully selected vintage rugs to soften the newly wood-clad floors. Custom millwork radiator covers with picture-frame molding and Caesarstone tops replaced falling-apart metal enclosures for the A/C and heaters under the windows. Each has a powder-coated metal grill inset into the top and they act as gorgeous shelves to display a few more curios. These new units alone make the apartment look so much better! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michael and Dennis also helped us outfit each of the seven closets in the apartment with custom shelving, so that we could reorganize all of Ron’s belongings to make more sense for his daily use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-18504 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11.jpg" alt="custom radiator millwork covers" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18505" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12.jpg" alt="traditional bedroom aesthetic" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were so happy with their work that toward the end of the project, we even decided to hit on a long term wish list item for Ron: a deep-soaking tub in the master bath, and brand new shower and sink hardware (all from Rohl through Gracious Homes) in both bathrooms!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18507 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="rohl shower faucets" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18508" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15.jpg" alt="large format white shower tiles" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the full renovation took a lot of hard work, energy, and time. Ron loves showing off his new space and everyone is thrilled with the results. We’re grateful to the team at Sweeten for matching us with George and his crew, who were dependable and creative. They were flexible enough to work with us to incorporate lots of changes on the fly, and helped make our initial fantasy vision into a tangible reality.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years after Claudia purchased her one-bedroom, one-bath apartment in a quaint Upper East Side co-op, she felt ready to renovate. Since arriving in 2001, this software engineer knew that she’d eventually need to address the 30 year-old carpeting, fixtures, and odd space issues&#8230;or simply move on and find a new home. Loving everything about the building, the neighborhood, and her lifestyle, she decided to stay put and find a designer who could bring an architectural approach and a restorative eye to this lovely space. Read on for the stunning reveal of Claudia’s thoughtful and personal apartment renovation!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18472 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg" alt="apartment renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-18306"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia first readied herself with a straightforward list of tasks she wanted to accomplish. Sure, the place hadn’t been updated anywhere in three decades, so finishes throughout were more than dated. But she also craved more space, and after seeing neighboring units without the built-ins and boxy windows that had been added in a mid-80s renovation, she realized she might be able to reclaim some hidden square footage (and long-missing electrical outlets) in her own unit. The kitchen and bathroom needed a complete treatment, and the living room and bedroom required diametrically opposed designs: out with chunky built-ins on multiple walls in the living room, and in with a thoughtful and multi-functional built-in for the windowed bedroom wall.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishlist near complete, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claudia decided to post her project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2531" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was matched with a Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who specializes in creating architecture and interior design solutions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon meeting with Frederick and his team, Claudia made an overarching goal clear: She wasn’t interested in solely installing modern finishes over the old. The original bones were just as important as the final coat of paint. That pristine 1929 appeal needed to show through and reveal itself via new design details. With extensive renovations planned in every room, Claudia moved out of the apartment temporarily to allow for Frederick and his crew to get started. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia believed that original parquet floors were hiding underneath all the carpeting, and she was right. Frederick had the wood floors sanded and refinished, bringing them back to life without introducing any new materials. With extra sheetrock walls encroaching in multiple directions, the team chipped away at the wall of boxed windows, disposing of an 18 inch layer of brick and wood. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avert your eyes if you live in a typical NYC co-op, because you will probably NEVER experience this, but somehow Claudia nearly doubled the size of her living room windows by combining them, flooding the space with lovely natural light. All of the windows were replaced with double-paned versions, up to code with the building and boasting the required heat, freeze and UV protections. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the opposite end of the room, the crew stripped away the ever-so-slightly-asymmetrical built-in shelving and cabinetry to reveal an open, wood-burning hearth. Claudia turned to a local Italian couple who specialize in old world mantels for an understated limestone facade, and Frederick brought in a specialist to design and install crown moldings along the doorways, windows, ceiling and floor boards throughout the apartment. Claudia’s mother helped source the final touch: an accent wall in a serene, neutral palette is an elegant and stylish addition to an inviting new living room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the kitchen, Claudia knew she wanted a white kitchen and was unsentimental about getting rid of the “horrible” gray linoleum floors. Cosmetic features aside, she wanted more storage space and a way to install an exhaust fan over a new cooktop. In an attempt to carve out some casual eating space, the previous owners had put some very limited cabinetry along the left-side of the galley, and appliances took up most of the storage and prep space on the right side.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claudia chose a small pearlescent stone tile in a melange of pebble hues to take the place of the severely dated synthetic floor she’d grown to detest. High-impact cabinet changes were custom fit into the small space. Claudia worked with an Italian purveyor specializing in hidden compartments for the fridge and hood, and managed to conceal all of the major stainless steel appliances except for the striking new Bertazzoni range, because, Bertazzoni! The laminate countertops were removed and replaced with a white Caesarstone slab and corresponding backsplash, and an undermount stainless sink&#8211;supplied by the same producer as the cabinets&#8211;was installed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18452 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="white Caesarstone countertop" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18453 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18454 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="stainless undermount sink" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18455" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-08-10.gif" alt="Bertazzoni range" width="600" height="797" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia knew she didn’t need to change the footprint of her bathroom to incorporate the many features she wanted here. The tub needed two shower curtains to keep water in, the full surround of blue-gray tile muted natural light, and the bulky vanity was topped with a throwback plastic ball faucet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia went with a floor tile pick that is complementary but different to those used in the kitchen, and with Frederick’s help, incorporated extra pieces into a design detail border along the wall of freshly installed white subway tiles. The tub came out and was replaced with a slightly larger and more modern German piece to coincide with new spa accessories: a rainwater shower head plus a handheld option for added luxe. The fixed shower rod was taken down to make way for a glass partition and hinged glass door that swings out for maximum function and style. Claudia chose a pedestal sink for extra floor and knee space, opting to place storage behind hidden cabinets in the wall instead. Almost all of the bathroom features were handpicked from local design shop Elegance in Hardware, including the polished nickel door knobs, which are exclusive to the outlet.  </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bedroom, Claudia and her design-build team pursued the opposite approach. Instead of doing away with built-ins, they found areas where custom additions would have a meaningful impact on space use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They added a custom closet in the hallway, outfitted  by California Closets, just outside the bath before entering the living room and introduced this same custom storage concept in the bedroom, behind a mirrored closet wall—one of the only major features that remained. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the carpet was torn out in the bedroom, Claudia approached Frederick with her hopes of incorporating a window seat before new wall treatment and molding went in. The designer re-enlisted his subcontractor to fashion a custom wooden seat built right into the new shelving set. The homeowner would just need an upholstered cushion and good book to make it complete.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia revealed to us that upon visiting her apartment, after the renovations were complete and the dust had nearly cleared, she stood and looked around the empty rooms and was filled with the sense that nothing had changed. It was as if she were apartment shopping in 1929, which, she explained, is exactly what she wanted.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gregg and Kelly were right where they wanted to be. The couple had just closed on a sought-after two-bedroom in a very popular Brooklyn co-op. But there was a big nagging problem lurking in the &#8220;heartbeat&#8221; of their home: severely dated decor wrapped in really bad wiring. The new homeowners just couldn’t focus on a future in their new apartment when the kitchen was so obviously stuck in the dark. Read on down for Gregg’s take on their sleek new kitchen renovation! </span></i></p>

</a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Gregg, Brooklyn homeowner</span></i><span id="more-17761"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For about one year, Kelly and I searched all over Brooklyn to not only find the perfect apartment, but also the perfect neighborhood. The more we saw, the more our search started to narrow to Clinton Hill and the Clinton Hill Co-ops in particular. Located on what I think is one of the most beautiful streets in Brooklyn, the Clinton Hill Co-op campus had everything we were looking for: a sensible layout, sturdy prewar structure, and great value for the money.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We zero’d in on a two-bedroom unit that was in need of a lot of work. Many of the apartments in the Co-ops have been renovated before; this one never had and it was a mess. In fact, it was so untouched that even the light switches were still push button rather than actual switches. But, having seen numerous posts on Sweeten, we knew the potential of the space and had a vision for what it could be. The first and most important thing for us to get to was the kitchen and dining room area. We </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten and found </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Mick</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help us with the project.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17773" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were a few things we really wanted. First, we wanted something light and airy. Our old apartment only had two windows and both were in constant shadow, so we wanted something that really allowed the light to filter into the living space. We also wanted a place that we could host people in and have a couple of different gathering spots. And finally, I wanted a place that would be easy to cook in and easy for storage. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mick guided us through all that needed to be done, had suggestions along the way about how to make the space work even better, and let us know what to expect as things went on. We were lucky to have someone who was so honest and upfront as the apartment was in such bad shape. For instance, after knocking down some of the walls, we really got to see how bad some of the wiring was. Mick walked us through the options and took care of everything. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17775" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With walls down and new wiring installed, we were ready for the fun stuff. We wanted finishes that were clean and bright, again to allow the sunlight to come in and to make it feel fresh and open. We decided to go with modern white IKEA cabinets because of the solid quality and affordable pricing. Mick, as someone who normally creates custom cabinetry, was able to really help us design a plan that would make the cabinets not feel so cookie-cutter. For the countertops, we went with honed black granite because we wanted the look of a soapstone or black marble, but with a little more durability. The stone looks fantastic and is really a great contrast to the high-gloss cabinets. It was Mick who recommended we get a counter-depth fridge in order to keep things more open with clean lines. It turned out to be a great recommendation.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We put in new wood floors ourselves that I think bring some much needed warmth to the space. They are engineered floors and we really liked that they felt lived-in but not in a way that seemed artificial. We wanted something that was matte, had character, but would also be durable. This flooring ticked off all of those boxes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, we couldn’t be more thrilled with the results. The before and after photos really tell the tale. Mick was able to do a fantastic job&#8211;and on budget. Not only that, he has an attention to detail that is very hard to find in many NYC contractors. Most contractors are concerned with getting the job done and that is it &#8211; Mick is concerned with getting the job done and getting it done right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has been several months since the renovation and we both still say “we can’t believe this is actually our apartment”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re back in beautiful Brooklyn Heights to tour the rest of Hari and Kaity’s gorgeous one-bedroom apartment. Last week, we showed off the couple’s </span><strong><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hari-kaitys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new kitchen and bath</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and now we’re on to the creative ways in which they upped the glamour of their living and bedroom spaces and doubled (quadrupled?!) bedroom closet storage. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hari-kaitys-living-room-closet-renovation-brooklyn-heights/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17601 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-living-room-closet-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights Renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-living-room-closet-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-living-room-closet-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a><span id="more-17599"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hari and Kaity certainly did their homework when it came to collecting interior design inspiration and research. Perusing Pinterest and just about every architecturally-focused gallery out there, they pooled ideas and thought about renovations that had taken place in a neighboring apartment. They both loved the look of NYC’s quintessential pre-war buildings but also wanted to leave some room for more modern finishes. While the couple’s original </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten project post</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was mainly focused on upgrading their kitchen, their renovation evolved with the help of their </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and his team, as it began to make sense to take on work in other rooms while they were all at it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apartment’s floors had lost their luster, the living room was a blank slate, and the bedroom closet was clearly not cut out for a couple. Their contractor got to work, devising a plan to deliver smart upgrades in those high-impact places.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17503 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamal and his team sanded and stained the wood floors, bringing a rich depth and gleam to the wood planks that would serve as the basis for transformation in the living room and bedroom. Hari and Kaity initially pictured adding wainscot paneling to their living room and hallway, but after much debate decided it would be wasted once hidden behind furniture, so they opted for a series of decorative picture frame moldings instead. The simple addition was a low-cost and non-invasive way to give dimension to the boxy living room, and helps play up the shape of the apartment’s lovely window. They also decided to do away with ceiling fans, adding a glamorous tiered West Elm chandelier. This before and after is a testament to how refinished flooring, fresh paint, and luminous lighting choices can be enough to completely change a home!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17495 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-10.jpg" alt="west elm chandelier " width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-10.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-10-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17496 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-11.jpg" alt="picture frame moldings" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-11-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up, the bedroom and its limited closet space. Square footage in the bedroom left plenty of room for furniture, but the single closet was not a long-term option. Their Sweeten contractor set his sights on the bedroom’s far wall, seeing just enough room to create closets out of thin air without cutting off access to the bedroom window.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17504 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-04.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17511 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-01.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17497 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12.jpg" alt="full-size closets" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17603 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" alt="black knobs" width="600" height="899" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He built out two full-size closet structures, filled the interiors with Kaity’s vision for custom shelving and storage, and finished the additions with detailed paneling on the new closet doors. Hari and Kaity replaced all of the silver lever door handles throughout the home with brushed black knobs—another simple upgrade with striking effect. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what to do with the old bedroom closet? Because the original closet was so close to the bedroom’s entryway, an open office nook was a smarter use of space. The sliding doors were removed and a cozy little studious retreat fell into place. </span></p>

<span class="img-label"> Guest post by Deniz, Clinton Hill homeowner</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Clinton Hill apartment is part of a large co-op building right between Myrtle and Willoughby on Clinton Avenue. We purchased our one-bedroom in 2000 &#8212; it&#8217;s on the 12th floor and has wonderful views of Brooklyn, including all three bridges. It had been updated in the standard format of all the apartments remodeled by the co-op and had a closed-in kitchen with a sliding door, plus a pantry directly across from the kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband, Ramon, had long had the idea of opening up the kitchen but we didn’t really update anything as 15 years went by. Fast-forward to 2015 and we now had a teenage son. We were basically “living” in the living room, allowing him the privacy of the bedroom. While it could have been the other way around, we enjoyed having access to the kitchen and living area once he was asleep, and we liked that when his friends came over, they had their own room for play.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17321 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17320" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we had the opportunity to fully renovate the apartment, we stumbled across <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a>, and met this Sweeten architect and designer. Our architect really listened to my husband&#8217;s years of thinking of the best ways to open up and restructure the apartment. He was able to help us accomplish what we ultimately wanted, which was to create a large and open kitchen that highlighted our views, and brought light from all the windows into the space. The architect skillfully designed the space and helped us work with our limitations. After all, no matter how many walls we tore down, it&#8217;s still less than 1,000 square feet, and space is always an issue. The architect designed the living room to be completely convertible so that we could use it as a bedroom and/or open living space for guests or dancing (our favorite way to spend time together).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to invest in new floors as our existing floors were quite pockmarked and difficult to find replacement tiles for quick fixes. I am a former modern dancer and soft, even floors that I can feel my bare feet on and dance and move on are something that I have always dreamed of having in my home. I really wanted the kitchen floors to match the rest of the apartment and knew it was possible to do that with the right kind of wood floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I fell in love with the Madera Trade floor samples and we chose a light color/tone to brighten the apartment and make it look large. We also invested in the countertops and backsplash in the kitchen, choosing granite in Brown Antique. These materials, along with a Viking stove and Fisher &amp; Paykel double-drawer dishwasher and wine cooler, were the high dollar investments. We went with IKEA cabinets as custom design was too expensive for our budget. We also soundproofed with sub-flooring, added soundproofing in two of our walls, and brought in a number of lighting fixtures (including some old Tiffany stained-glass shades that Ramon restored).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I love the easy maintenance of the floors. They are amazingly strong, and because of the way they are made (see Madera Trade details), they don&#8217;t scratch or stain. The stone countertop is also an object of daily appreciation, with easy maintenance that will last and last. After a year in the apartment, it still looks brand new.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten was easy to use and helped us find our fit easily. The architect and his team worked quickly to get the design completed and he helped us navigate finding the right crew for the job. Our contractors were highly professional and were here every day, essentially keeping to the time allotted. We did have some budgetary limits, and since we invested in some expensive materials, we have yet to complete the interior paneling which will ultimately create a convertible living room space. We are taking our time with the interior aspects and consider that a &#8220;phase two&#8221; of the project.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the meantime, we love the open space, the light, and the energetic flow of the apartment. We still have some decisions to make about the space, and since we are here long term, we are in no rush.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Here&#8217;s a space that needs some sweetening.</h3>
<p>This one bedroom prewar apartment is on Clinton Avenue in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The building is located brilliantly, on a lovely residential block close to the subway station, shops and restaurants.  The apartment is on the second floor and faces a quiet rear courtyard, with three large windows that let in lots of light.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1092 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has been unoccupied for many years and looks as if it hasn&#8217;t been remodeled in about forty years.  It has its original wood floors, crown and base moldings, and window trim, although they&#8217;re in poor condition.  The building has masonry walls and a hot water heating system with cast iron radiators.  The original wood windows have been replaced with insulated aluminum windows.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1093 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1094 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The bathroom is roomy but has an awkward layout. The fixtures, wall tile, and floor tile all need to be replaced, and there&#8217;s a gaping hole in the ceiling.</p>

<p>The apartment has no real kitchen, just a freestanding stove and sink near the entry.  The plastic laminate cabinets are in bad shape and there are no counters.  The refrigerator is currently in the living room.</p>

<p>It would be easy to look at this apartment and turn away.  The floors, walls and ceilings all need to be repaired and refinished.  It has no closets or built in cabinets.  The small side windows look out onto  light wells.</p>
<p>But a closer look at the plan reveals that it&#8217;s actually quite wide, 14 feet, which allows for some flexibility in the layout.  It would be possible to reconfigure the kitchen and bathroom so that they&#8217;re more accommodating and more functional.  The windows at the rear of the apartment are quite large.  They bring in a lot of light and overlook a quiet space.  The entire layout could be opened up to bring more light from the back windows into the center of the apartment.</p>
<p>This apartment is in a great location and has a generous footprint.  It would benefit a great deal from just a little bit of sweetening!</p>
