<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting started on commercial renovations can be both an exciting and overwhelming time. Perhaps you’re launching a business you’ve been dreaming about for a long time, or, if that dream has already proven successful, you’re expanding (congratulations!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches business owners to the best general contractors and helps the renovation stay on track, offers these guidelines for taking on commercial renovations, whether you are gearing up for an office build-out, a restaurant, retail space or some other venture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We based this article on New York City, but it has relevance to wherever you are in the country. The majority of US states base their codes on guidelines from the International Code Council. Cities and towns also have similar procedures when it comes to requirements such as building permits and Certificate of Occupancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few ways to get a head start with your own research. For example, taking a look at your potential building&#8217;s Certificate of Occupancy (CO) or browsing through online building records to get an idea of existing violations. Once you are seriously considering either buying or leasing a property or renovating what you have, that’s the right time to bring in a pro—an engineer, an architect, or a good or knowledgeable general contractor—so there are no surprises down the road.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few things to consider before unleashing the sledgehammer, and in some cases, signing a lease.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40003 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/HowSweetenWorks.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="50" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review the certificate of occupancy</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Number one, two, and three on your checklist before even committing to a lease should be: check the CO, check the CO, and check the CO. The document shows what you can legally use a property for—an office, a private residence, a restaurant, etc. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Here’s a <a href="https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/bsqpm01.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> to search in New York City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changing a CO is a costly process and, in some cases, it’s impossible to shift it to another use, according to Mercedes Hernandez from S&amp;M Expediting. Expediters are an optional addition to your building team to speed up the slow grind of permits, especially for commercial renovations in bureaucratic cities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We get a lot of calls after the fact when they start the process of getting necessary licenses. That’s when they realize they have a problem,” she said. One client signed a lease with the intention of turning a space into a gym. However, the certificate did not allow for a health club in the premises. That client is still trying to change it and it has already been 12 months. The easiest route is to lease or buy a space where the CO fits your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COs can also dictate smaller issues. For example, if you want to use the property’s backyard for additional restaurant seating, the certificate needs to specify that this is allowable. Otherwise, the CO will need <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/cofo_guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updating</a>. Smaller additions such as this are a much easier fix than a change in the legal use of a property, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><br />Understand existing violations on your property</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Especially if the property you’re eyeing hasn’t changed hands or had a new tenant for some time, it’s possible it already has building violations. It could be that someone did work without a permit, installed a rooftop AC unit incorrectly, or the fire sprinkler system isn’t functioning. “When you go to get a permit, these things are scrutinized and discovered,” explained <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. If the violations aren’t corrected, that could mean a costly stop-work order on your construction project later on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To kickstart this process, like COs, city councils often keep online databases where you can search open violations, when a permitted job was last completed on a building, and what that job was. Complaints about the building—such as work without a permit or a business operating without the correct CO—might also give you a hint at what violations you could encounter. The good news is with a commercial lease it is common to get these violations taken care of by the landlord, but the lease needs to specify this, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While you might get a sense of a building’s open violations from your own research, it’s unlikely you will spot every one of them on your own. The best plan is to walk through a potential location for your business with an architect, engineer or a GC, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Mark</a>, another Sweeten general contractor. That pro will help you decide if a property is a workable fit for your vision, he said. It’s also something that pros often do as a complimentary service to potential clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you need to determine if your property can handle the weight of your business. And in some cases, we mean that quite literally. Hernandez’s example illustrates the point: if you want to flip a clothing retail space into a car showroom, it’s a wise idea to make sure the floor can support the added weight. Or how about creating an open-plan office that’s perfect for teamwork? Before drawing up those plans, you need to know what walls are load-bearing and if they can be moved. If moving that wall (or not) is a deal breaker, it’s best to know the capabilities of a space before signing on the dotted line. “You need to ask what are the limits of design,” said Sweeten contractor Colin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessing the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEPs) situation is crucial especially if you’re turning a space into a food establishment with a kitchen. Gas, plumbing and electrical will be under more pressure, so can the property’s existing infrastructure handle it, or is an extensive overhaul required? If it is, prepare your budget and timeline realistically. That’s <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/nycbe/downloads/pdf/nycstarter_guide_restaurant.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another reason</a> besides the existing CO that some business owners take the express route of leasing a property that was previously a restaurant. While it&#8217;s not a given everything will be up to code (don’t forget those existing violations), it is easier and cheaper than starting from scratch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39363" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01.jpg" alt="Babeland storefront" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/babeland-retail-commercial-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A retail renovation</a> in Downtown New York by Sweeten contractor <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Checking on a building&#8217;s envelope</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An envelope is building speak for whatever separates the outside from the inside—windows, doors, roof, etc. It’s another area worth looking into before starting your project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessibility for the disabled is often overlooked. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair. While many older buildings may have had their compliance grandfathered in, major commercial renovations could <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2006/rpt/2006-R-0335.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trigger</a> the need for properties to line up with the ADA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other areas that could change the scope of your project include asbestos in window glazing, which would need to be replaced. A property that is a landmark or in a historic district could also <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/lpc/index.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impact</a> if and how you can alter your building’s facade, including doors and windows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What are your facility requirements?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most health codes will require an employer to provide access to toilet facilities. For offices, this could mean a shared bathroom on a floor, according to Hernandez, the expediter. “They have to make sure employees have access to a bathroom from within the building,” she said. One client suggested sending employees to another building, but this was not permitted under the health code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The size of a food establishment will likely determine how many bathrooms are required for patrons (some sort of bathroom access is always required for employees). In 2012, New York City actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/nyregion/rule-shift-cuts-restroom-requirements-at-new-york-restaurants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowered</a> the required bathrooms, permitting small cafes, restaurants, and bars with fewer than 31 seats to have one bathroom, not two. Those with fewer than 20 seats are <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not</a> required to provide a bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like any project, commercial renovations that are well planned and equipped with the right team of people can be exciting. Just be sure to consider these five areas early to keep your renovation on the straight and narrow.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064728861"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>What is a certificate of occupancy?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A certificate of occupancy (CO) is a document that details what someone can legally use a property for, and the limits to which the property can be changed for that use. For example, a CO could state that a property can be used as an office, a private residence, or a restaurant. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Sometimes, it is possible to change a CO to cover a different use, but this can be costly and time-consuming.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064746876"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to renovate a commercial building</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">First, review the certificate of occupancy. This will tell you what you are legally allowed to use the building for (an office space, a residence, a gym, etc.) Then, research whether there are any existing violations on the property. Review the space with an architect or contractor, and check for unpermitted work. Also review the structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work. Will you be able to move walls? Can the current flooring support your business use? Make sure the building’s envelope–the windows, doors, and roof–are in good working condition. Consider people with disabilities. Is there a way for wheelchair users to enter the building? Lastly, understand your facility requirements, like mandatory bathrooms.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Tell us a little bit about Chikarashi and how the brand began.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chef Michael:</strong> The brand began with an idea from Ivy and Selwyn wanting to bring a Polynesian restaurant to Chinatown. They had some ideas considering the food culture and popularity that were going on in the market when I was brought into the project. I thought about the ingredients that are common and used my Japanese training to add to chirashi (a big bowl of rice mixed with fish and vegetables) and to an overall poke concept.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the opening of your brick-and-mortar store?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Selwyn:</strong> For our initial location, we were looking to do a nice concept in the Chinatown neighborhood that was not Chinese food. We had always been enamored with Japanese cuisine and saw the bubbling trend of the poke coming up. We liked the concept, but didn’t like any of the execution that was going around, so we partnered with Chef Mike to create our own take on it. The brick-and-mortar space was obviously something that we needed. We had come across a small space that was available and knew this concept wouldn&#8217;t require a full, traditional kitchen build, but could be done quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> How does your new restaurant space represent your brand?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ivy:</b> We serve Japanese chirashi and poke-inspired bowls, so in terms of the design, we would naturally lean towards Japanese minimalism. We took design cues from smaller shops in Japan and brought them into our space here. In both the Canal Street and this new location, we brought in a lot of earth tones with the walls paneled in maple wood. You get a similar sense if you were to walk into a ramen shop or a sushi restaurant in Japan, or Kyoto. We decided to not have a large space, but that something roughly 700 square feet was a nice size to work with. It’s a little bit more cozy and mainly for people to come in to take their bowls to go or to sit down. We have eight seats.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> How did you, as a client, work with Sweeten and how do you think Sweeten can help business owners like yourself?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Selwyn:</b> Sweeten has been really wonderful because it’s almost a one-stop shop, if you will. They offer a lot of guidance and the vetting of their partners is pretty extensive. We felt really comfortable when it came time to select a general contractor to work on the project itself, that the company would fulfill the needs of the build but also would fit well from a chemistry standpoint. I think Sweeten handles that matching process wonderfully.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> Did you have any last questions going into the project that you felt that Sweeten was able to help you with?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Selwyn:</b> Yeah, absolutely. Sweeten was always there to kind of help navigate at every step of the process. Any questions were always answered in a quick fashion and they really offered their years of expertise to make the entire process a smooth renovation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: What is Fool’s Gold Records and how did the brand begin?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ben Jacobs, Fool&#8217;s Gold Records:</strong> The company was founded by two DJs, A-trak and Nick Catchdubs, as a Brooklyn-based record label in 2007. We&#8217;ve morphed into a retail brand and a bit of a marketing agency, but first and foremost we&#8217;re a record label.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26311 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-Before-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="1085" />Original retail shop on Metropolitan Ave in Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: What led to the opening of a brick-and-mortar store?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR: </strong>We felt it was important to have a retail presence as an extension of the brand and the art that we create. Our first retail store and offices were actually in the same space on Metropolitan in Brooklyn. We were making tee shirts and either selling them online or tossing them off stage at shows. We decided, “Let’s take advantage of this space and open it up to the public.” It was a success and just came to a point where we outgrew it and it was a little too small to do enough with it. I happened to walk by this building—147 Grand Street—and saw a big open space for rent. The wheels started turning and we decided to come up with a new space that was more functional for how the brand was evolving.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How does your new retail space represent your brand? Why did you need to leave your former location? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR:</strong> The old space was very narrow. Everything was fixed and there wasn’t much room to grow. The idea for the new space was not only to be bigger but a little bit more modular. For events, we have the flexibility to pull the podiums out or move the DJ booth over a bit. We’re doing art shows, workshops for kids, and DJ workshops—a range that ties into New York’s creative, arts and music community.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26248 size-chrono" title="DJ booth" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-03-723x482.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26252 size-chrono" title="retail shop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How was your vision executed by working with Sweeten? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR:</strong> I worked closely with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Sweeten contractor</a> who did the work to make the space a reality. We had a pretty defined concept visually, but it was a bit up in the air in terms of how we were going to execute it. These enfilades that we’re sitting under, these three structures, were an experiment. We had to figure out how we were going to get the polycarbonate to stand and be sturdy and supported during events. Due to the nature of a lot of the materials we selected, there was a fair amount of trial and error and I appreciated the contractor&#8217;s willingness to experiment until we found the right methods and his patience throughout the process. We wouldn’t have been able to do that without him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">&#8220;The enfilades were a simple way to get a strong view right when you walk in. It also takes all the aspects of Fool&#8217;s Gold and puts them on display individually, sort of like laying out the ingredients for a recipe.&#8221; &#8211; Designer Dong-Ping Wong</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How did you, as a client, work with Sweeten?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR: </strong>We found Sweeten through our designer, Family New York. I definitely noticed how quickly and efficiently we were able to get bids and that it wasn’t a disjointed process. From the receiving end, it was like, “Wow! We’ve got a lot of general contracting options here, and a lot of good people who are interested in this job. Great!” It simplified the process and gave us a very strict and transparent way of comparing our options and what’s out there. During the renovation, there was a lot of communication with our Sweeten contractor—emails, calls, weekly meetings. He was very involved in the process and genuinely concerned with making sure it turned out exactly as we were hoping.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26259 size-chrono" title="office" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-12-723x482.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26258 size-chrono" title="conference room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do you think Sweeten can help small business owners like yourself?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR:</strong> Sweeten helps business owners by simplifying and demystifying the process a bit. It’s pretty daunting if you’ve never been through the renovation process before. So you&#8217;ll have questions like, “Where do I start? What are the first steps? When do I know I’m done?” All these different questions you have going into it kind of blind. It definitely takes a bit of the edge off of figuring out what to do and if you’re feeling a little bit lost.</p>
