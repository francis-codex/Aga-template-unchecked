<p><span style="color: #76808f;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Samantha</span></i></span></p>
<h3>Recreating an under-used garage</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running their creative agency, VERSUS, in New York City takes up a lot of their time during the day. So Samantha Louise Barnes and her husband, Justin, like to </span>relax at their weekend home in Fairfield County. It&#8217;s located in Weston, which is a quaint small town with tree-lined streets, good schools, and notable architecture. The town is known for its mid-century modern architecture and their home is no exception. It was built in 1948 by architect Lloyd Flood, who was an early associate of architect Edward Durell Stone.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>The couple shares the home, which was previously renovated, with their two-year-old rescue cat, Louise. Set on a dead-end street, Samantha wanted to make the most of her 1,750-square-foot home. That meant converting the garage. They rarely use the second bay. Samantha and Justin take their car to the train station every week and leave it parked there until the weekend. So what to do with this underutilized space? Create that ceramic studio Samantha had always dreamed about, of course.</p>
<h3>In search of a contractor</h3>
<p>Samantha wanted to get the renovation done quickly—preferably in a month’s time. So she started researching, pricing, and locating the equipment needed for the soon-to-be ceramic studio. It was challenging but she found a kiln in South Carolina. Apparently, a lot of people had the same idea to create a ceramic studio during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Once this was taken care of, she set her sights on hiring the right contractor for the job. She posted the project on Sweeten to find a general contractor. “[Sweeten] offered advice every step of the way,” said Samantha. “I felt confident that I would be happy with who they vetted.” Samantha and Justin hired a Sweeten contractor and the project began.</p>
<h3><b><img decoding="async" title="grey-and-black-industrial-design-storage-cum-display-unit" class="alignnone wp-image-50929 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-15.jpg" alt="Grey and black industrial design storage cum display unit with open shelves" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></h3>
<h3>Figuring out the layout</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea was to choose the shorter bay—made smaller by a closet located in the back—and converting it into the studio. Twenty-five percent of the closet would make space for the kiln while the other 75 percent remained as a closet accessible via the other garage bay.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But Samantha also worried about getting the electric requirements correct. So, she worked closely with her Sweeten contractor and his electrician to ensure that the kiln would run safely. They gave the kiln its own outlet and dedicated breaker box.</span></p>
<h3>A ceramic studio comes to life</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of the renovation is a beautiful, artistic space. They kept the back window to allow light to shine through behind the kiln. And added another window above the air conditioner to give a bright airiness to the space. Their contractor also assisted with picking out the double French doors that replaced the original garage door. And figured out the right air conditioner/heating unit to match the electricity needs.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Having my own space separate from the house is wonderful,” said Samantha. “It’s additional creative space we just love having access to.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Connecting with the main house</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the aesthetics, Samantha and Justin chose to keep some consistency with the main house’s design. For example, the flooring in the main house is a poured concrete so they went with that in the ceramic studio. The concrete fits in nicely with the artistic vibe of the space. Plus, it’s safe to use under the kiln and Samantha likes the “rough” look. The trim is the same as in the main house as well. Material choices and style were to keep a cohesive look and feel. </span></p>

<h3>Finding their general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Samantha and Justin first started thinking about renovating, they knew it wasn&#8217;t going to be a big job. However, they did want to find a trustworthy, qualified contractor. &#8220;We are only at our home on the weekends, so we still consider ourselves new to the area and needed a jumping-off place to find someone,&#8221; said Samantha. &#8220;Instead of running through a slew of contractors on the Internet, I thought of Sweeten.&#8221; The result met all the couple&#8217;s expectations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having my own space separate from the house is wonderful,” said Samantha. “It’s additional creative space we just love having access to.”</span></p>

			<h2>Whether done in houses or co-ops, kitchen renovations for families make life easier</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-open-kitchen-with-cabinetry" class="alignnone wp-image-50708 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8.jpg" alt="white open kitchen with cabinetry and dining nook on a hardwood flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">&#8220;After&#8221; photos by Kate Glicksberg for Sweeten</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you have young children, you realize quickly what does and doesn’t work about the space you’re in. Common issues are a lack of storage or insufficient dining space. Perhaps you need a better flow between rooms. Or, it might be all of the above.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here, three Sweeten renovations show how parents transformed kitchens and bathrooms into spaces that work for their families—adding functionality and, of course, beautiful form to their homes.</span></p>

<h3>Borrowed Space Makes the Difference for a Brooklyn Kitchen</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><a href="https://sweeten.box.com/s/crjlud4mi0is4f3ywrnzpis0uci1o877"><img decoding="async" title="homeowner-sitting-with-her-child" class="alignnone wp-image-50710 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-portrait-13.jpg" alt="Homeowner sitting happily with her child" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-portrait-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-portrait-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-portrait-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><em><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;"> </span></em></span><span class="s3"><em><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">“After&#8221; photos by Kate Glicksberg for Sweeten</span></em></span></p>
<h4>An inhospitable kitchen</h4>
<p>Betsy, a teacher, and Zach, an executive at a retail company, live in a two-bedroom, two-bath duplex garden apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The couple now has Amina, age 2, and two dogs, Tristen and Archie. Their duplex in a 19th-century brownstone was in decent shape but didn’t quite match their design aesthetic.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><span class="s4">They held off on renovating for a few years, but once Amina was born, they decided to take the plunge and finally renovate to have their home suit their ever-changing needs. They wanted to make the most of their 1,200-square-foot main floor. “</span><span class="s1">We bought knowing we would ultimately like to renovate, but the apartment was pretty updated; it just wasn’t our aesthetic,” said Betsy. “We had been living in the space for nearly three years, and the kitchen was especially difficult.” The refrigerator was apartment-sized and the peninsula-shaped design meant that only one person could be in the space at a time. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">So <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/28307#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Betsy and Zach posted their project</a> on Sweeten to find a general contractor who could help with all of their design challenges and in addition fix the poor lighting in the main living area. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Mixing old with modern elements</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To make more room and utilize the space more efficiently, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Sweeten contractor</a> reduced the size of the hall bathroom to add a bit more space to the tiny kitchen. The floors were converted from a dated yellow to a beautiful hardwood. They added a mix of traditional elements (classic hardwood floors) with a modern aesthetic (flat-panel cabinets). Multiple sources of lighting like a chandelier were installed over the main table as well as high hats to keep the open space bright and airy.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Our Sweeten contractor was great in every small decision, from the pull-out storage options for utensils to hiding the unsightly microwave in a garage cabinet to making the fridge seamlessly blend into the cabinetry—a big feat considering we now have a 36” french door refrigerator,” said Betsy. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When asked about her advice for renovators, Betsy had this to say: “Be smart about your budget. We went with a quote that was comfortably below our bottom line, and this gave us the flexibility to spend more in certain areas and save in others without constantly being stressed about going over.”</span></p>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Seeking space to grow</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Paul, a collegiate swim coach, and Margaret, a pediatric nurse practitioner, bought their 1,</span><span class="s1">700-square-foot, two-bedroom condo, they knew they wanted to renovate it right away. “We had been living in the Heights neighborhood of Jersey City, but wanted more space for a growing family,” said Paul. “North Bergen’s mix of affordability, family-friendly amenities, and proximity to work appealed to us.” However, to make the house family-friendly, they turned to Sweeten. </span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/50727" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul and Margaret posted their project </a>on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4145" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired a general contractor</a> to renovate their kitchen. “Sweeten was helpful in showing us qualified contractors in our area,” said Paul. “Being New Jersey residents, we valued Sweeten’s referral model.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They wanted a contractor who could take their kitchen into the 21st century, updating their old laminate-and-tile kitchen into a more modern space. They wished for additional counter space as well as storage—common must-haves for a young family. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">A new layout brings high impact results</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-with-granite-countertop" class="alignnone wp-image-50717 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="White kitchen with granite countertop along with double door fridge after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-with-glass-countertop" class="alignnone wp-image-50714 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="White kitchen with glass countertop on a kitchen peninsula after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinetry-with-black-granite" class="alignnone wp-image-50716 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="White kitchen cabinetry with black granite countertop and double hung window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple worked with the firm to give their space a clean, contemporary feel without having to do a major overhaul. They didn’t remove or move any walls but they were able to reconfigure the existing layout to work better for their family. They extended the countertop and added cabinetry for additional storage. Plus, they included a nod to New York by way of a simple subway tile backsplash. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Our contractor was helpful in keeping the project moving despite material delays and the start of the pandemic,” said Paul. These first-time renovators could not be happier with their now user-friendly new kitchen. </span></p>

<h4>Reduce clutter, expand livable space</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A 1925 side-hall colonial was in need of a remodel for homeowners Jennifer and Sauyee. They made plans to live in the 1,740-square-foot home in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, for a few years before embarking on a renovation. With two small children, they wanted to make sure when they did decide to renovate that they could pinpoint exactly what was needed to make their busy lives more convenient and comfortable.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The layout lacked usable counter space and had way too many countertop appliances to be functional. Plus, the flow from the kitchen to the rest of the house needed to be reconsidered to make it more family-friendly. They also desperately wanted more usable space and a lighter, brighter vibe. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/63305" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They posted their project</a> on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to find a reliable general contractor in their area. </span><span class="s1">Jennifer and Sauyee were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5676" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with a Sweeten contractor</a> and the work began.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Remodeling for family home cooking</span></h4>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The finished product is a more modern, usable space—one that reflects the couple’s personality and everyday needs. The pantry unit is perfect for the kids’ snacks as well as additional storage for their kitchen essentials. And even though it is not as obvious as some of the other aesthetic details, the homeowners are equally appreciative of the properly vented range hood. As a family of four, cooking is very important and any cook knows a bad vent hood can be a real nuisance. So, it was an upgrade they really wanted. They chose gray Shaker cabinets, light quartz countertops, and redid the hardwood floors throughout to make a cohesive design statement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-dining-space-with-dining-table" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50727 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="White dining space with dining table on a hardwood floor after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-walk-in-shower" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50730" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="White bathroom with walk in shower along with a pedestal washbasin and a rectangle bathroom mirror" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">In addition, they decided to also remodel the bathroom since the kitchen was getting a facelift. They went with a gray color palette: <span class="s5">light, marble-style tile for the floor and shower wall, with an accent dark, geometric shower floor. But t</span><span class="s1">heir favorite part? The heated floors—appreciated by the kids and adults alike. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>During COVID-19, certain renovation projects became even more important for homeowners</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44610 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4.jpg" alt="Image of the interior of a renovated Hamptons ranch home" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) A Sweeten homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/southampton-home-renovation-transforms-garage-into-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #76808f;">turns the garage into a living room</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic forced us to take a hard look at our homes. Many were grateful for the security and comfort our homes offered. But many more made note of the features that their homes lacked. At a time when almost half of the workforce was working from home and schools relied on distance learning, renovation projects became top of mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the renovation mindset may be a little different going forward. Jean Brownhill, the founder and CEO of Sweeten discussed the current state of renovation on <em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sweeten-founder-jean-brownhill-on-new-rules-renovation/id1520457603?i=1000504585856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Time</a>,</em> a podcast hosted by <em>Domino</em> editor-in-chief Jessica Romm Perez. One trend they discussed is the emergence of practicality and functionality.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone&#8217;s goal is to make their finished project picture perfect. But to actually live in the space, other things may be more important. Here are some top projects Sweeten saw grow in popularity over the last year.</span></p>
<h3>Top COVID-19 renovation projects</h3>
<h4>Creating new living areas</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With people spending so much time at home, they adapted their living spaces to new uses. Many people upgraded their outdoor living areas by adding outdoor kitchens and other living spaces. Also, it wasn&#8217;t clear if a vacation away would be possible, so outdoor living space became more important. It also makes it possible to socialize with others if indoor entertaining isn’t an option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because health clubs and gyms were closed, many people looked for ways to squeeze a workout space into their living areas. People <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-modern-basement-renovation-produces-a-clean-slate-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adapted spare rooms or unfinished areas</a> like basements to create home gyms. </span></p>
<h4>Kitchen and bathroom remodels still in the spotlight</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchen and bathroom renovations are still popular. Although kitchens have always had many uses, their multitasking ability became more important during the pandemic. Kids often did their remote learning there, and adults used them for makeshift home offices. That&#8217;s in addition to the regular cooking, eating, and cleaning that goes on in a kitchen. The National Kitchen and Bath Association reports that in addition to upgraded appliances, there was an increase in requests for easy-to-clean surfaces, video watching ability, and device charging stations in the cook space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bathrooms became personal sanctuaries more than ever before. After a few weeks that turned into months into the pandemic, people came to value self-care more than ever. Even those who had not considered bath renovations undertook them to improve on their self-care routine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some bath update trends include oversized showers that feature multiple spray heads and body sprays, as well as a steam option. Voice commands can activate preset water temperatures and start music from a personal playlist. Ventilation fans do more than removing moisture: some have LED lighting that helps prevent mold growth. Others feature multi-color lights to change the mood of the room. Many spa-like features can be controlled by smartphones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that most renovations had in common was ease of maintenance. You can renovate a space that looks great, but you have to live in it. &#8220;I think that is one reason why porcelain tiles and planks are so popular,&#8221; said Jean. &#8220;They are easy to clean and they can be made to look like any material. &#8220;</span></p>
<h4>Reworking existing spaces</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, we can relate to how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our work habits. The typical household can get hectic with everyone vying for counter space where they can work, as well as computer time. The problem was frequently solved by setting up work and play areas throughout the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jean mentioned the trend of installing temporary glass panels in the home. These solve the noise problem that happens when someone is on a video call while someone else is unloading the dishwasher, other people are having a conversation, and kids are running around playing. Panels and interior windows give people acoustic separation. &#8220;We’re not looking for visual separation, but what we do want, and need, is acoustic separation,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A closet organizing system that lets you store things neatly and efficiently may be of more use than a room straight out of the pages of a magazine. &#8220;As someone doing a renovation, you don&#8217;t rise to the level of your goals so much as you fall to the level of the systems you put in place,&#8221; said Jean. While we usually want our homes to look fashionable, the emphasis for homes was on function for 2020. </span></p>
<h4>Using unused space</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As floor plans were reconfigured, any unused or underutilized areas became prime real estate. Guest bedrooms became home offices or study lounges. But the real stars were spaces like basements, attics, and garages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attics became playrooms for children. Basements were also used as play areas, but many were converted to home gyms. Some drywall and flooring, and maybe a little weatherproofing, turned these storage areas into useful living spaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some places, such as Los Angeles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people are adding ADUs</a>. An ADU is short for accessory dwelling unit. It is a new living space added to an existing building. Garages are being converted to home offices, but also studio apartments. The apartments can be rented out in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic presents new reasons to think creatively about our living spaces. Although we hope the pandemic will stay a once-in-a-lifetime event, we can all take cues from these COVID-19 renovation projects to inspire our own spaces at home.</span></p>

</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you and your client come together?</p>
<p><strong>Piper:</strong> Packet sought an interior design agency to align its growing office space in Lower Manhattan with its dynamic, emerging brand. Packet’s co-founder and CMO, Jacob Smith, reached out to another one of our tech clients (White Ops, who is also a customer of Packet) for a referral, and after noting our work there, gave us a call.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What is the client’s brand?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>Packet creates the high-touch aspect of high-tech — making cloud infrastructure more delightful to consume for the top digital businesses in the world. Clients, partners, and employees needed to experience the brand the moment they entered the office and throughout their journey in the space.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the opening of this new office space?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>The tech company, which was founded in 2014, had recently doubled its staff and was planning on another year of team growth. While the company is about 70% remote, NYC is its headquarters and one of its global “hubs” where the team gathers regularly. When another floor in the building they occupy became available, Packet <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/office-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">immediately grabbed it</a>.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do your new design and the materials used to represent your brand?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>The brand colors dictated our palette but it was important for us as designers to go beyond an easy and obvious link. It was essential to convey their brand experience throughout the space.</p>
<p>When selecting materials for their Manhattan office renovation, the sense of tangible authenticity—a certain “human-ness”—guided our choices. We opted for wood floors with character, felt walls, linoleum work surfaces, and a special dyed-through MDF that you leave exposed (as opposed to painting.) In addition to tactile fabrics, patterns that reference those seen in their cloud data centers further connected the space to the physical aspects of the product and brand.</p>
<p>In terms of space planning, Chapter Interiors strived for activity-based workplace design. Instead of asking the person to adjust to the space; we investigate how clients work and build spaces to suit. This results in an array of environments for employees—spaces that facilitate certain aspects of work and help optimize performance. An example was helping Packet design for different types of work (e.g. talk-heavy sales vs headphones-on engineering) while finding places for people to gather, recharge, exchange ideas, or be active.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45553 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-13-1.gif" alt="office phone booth" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) A phone booth for calls and video meetings</span></p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> With companies working remotely because of COVID-19, do you foresee companies downsizing their commercial workspaces? How will office spaces change and service in the post-COVID world?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>Yes! Reducing your footprint is an excellent opportunity to redesign your space (and save money.) In the short term post-COVID world, barriers will be erected and procedures will be put in place to minimize germ transmission. The longer-term implications are rethinking why people should go to the office.</p>
<p>Companies still need space for employees to gather. Moving forward, I see workplaces geared towards collaboration, team building, and brand connectivity with consumers and partners. Dedicated desks and independent work while at the office is less and less important. Numerous studies during the pandemic have proven that working from home does not hinder overall productivity.</p>
<p>It makes sense to combine working from home with time at the office. The best analogy I’ve heard so far is that working from home versus going into the office will be similar to eating at home versus going out to a restaurant. Employers need to make coming into the office special by providing spaces that foster activities that are worth traveling for. This ties into our strong belief in activity-based-workplace-design.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How was your vision executed by working with your Sweeten general contractor?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>The site manager was wonderful. From day one it was clear she cared about the quality of work and was very hands-on. Together, we worked to problem-solve several issues to make sure the <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-renovation-costs-pacing-your-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">final product was cost-effective</a>, durable, and displayed craftsmanship. I would love to work with her again!</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you, as a client, work with Sweeten?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>We work with contractors all the time— yet still, find the process of finding the right contractor daunting. For Packet&#8217;s office renovation in Manhattan, I had very targeted needs, and Sweeten helped me quickly vet and compare contractors.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Can you describe the “before” space?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>Words can&#8217;t describe this space before! It was raw, with filthy carpet and random paint patches throughout. Bad shape… But the potential that Packet saw was great, with pervasive natural light, airy ceiling height, and breathtaking views.</p>

<p><em>Guest post by Sweeten homeowner Rachel</em></p>
<h5>A Manhattan duplex remodel (instead of moving)</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is our first home, which we bought about six years ago just after we got married. When we were planning to expand our family, we knew we had to renovate or move. There was enough square footage, but we needed more distinct rooms or spaces. The apartment is a duplex co-op in Greenwich Village which was built in 1910. We love Greenwich Village so much and I really wanted to have the experience of raising a baby here. So, we renovated!</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Living here for so long before the renovation was really helpful since it gave us plenty of time to think about the best possible use of the space. We had a two-bedroom, two-bath, but wanted another bedroom for a baby. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/swap-rooms-better-layout-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old layout didn&#8217;t really work for entertaining</a>, either—the kitchen and dining room were upstairs while the living room was downstairs. Marco and I also wanted our own personal spaces within our home for his hobbies and for my closet/office. Overall, we hoped to create a comfortable family home that met everyone&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I always thought of our apartment as a hidden gem—a colorful, fun place where you could see a little girl growing up, sophisticated yet flexible enough to allow for events like playdates and parties. The general contractors we found through Sweeten were really amazing. On top of being creative problem solvers, they were incredibly nice guys!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The top floor would be a combined kitchen/dining/living area, so the kitchen needed to be functional but also beautiful enough for a dinner party. We hid most of the appliances behind paneled cabinets; an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221; and snack storage were organized inside hallway cabinets outfitted with marble countertops. When we have family-style dinners, we set up the self-serve dishes and bar in those spaces. So, yes, you&#8217;re in a kitchen, but it&#8217;s also an elegant dining room.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h5>Customizing the almost-black kitchen</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I cook a lot and was so excited for the stove. I wanted one of those fancy French stoves that come in custom colors, but they are so expensive! Instead, I found one from a U.S. manufacturer for maybe one-third the price. (They also do custom colors.) The cabinet color was chosen to match the stove, so this appliance is &#8220;hidden,&#8221; too. We wanted something different from the typical all-white kitchen that would also complement the light wood floors. This almost-black shade is just a little more interesting than plain black. It took lots of trips to the paint store for swatches!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We put a lot of thought into maximizing space and brainstorming with our Sweeten contractors. We really pushed them to be creative. I just kept saying, &#8220;We need to hide the trash and we need a spice cabinet. Where can we do it?&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t let up! The answer was wrapping the cabinets around the pillar and also where the lower cabinets end, which created a finished look. There were other details: I don&#8217;t think you can go wrong <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with big molding</a>. I chose the largest size I could find for the ceilings, doors, and floors! It makes a big difference for not a huge cost.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think you can go wrong with big molding. I chose the largest size I could find for the ceilings, doors, and floors! It makes a big difference for not a huge cost.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few challenges, like the flooring. It took a couple of tries to get it just right, including completely refinishing the downstairs floors more than once.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then there was the fireplace, which was very old and didn&#8217;t work. Our contractors figured out it was a faux fireplace that took up space for no reason, so it was removed.</p>
<h5>Matching new and old brick</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also needed to make our brand-new brick match with the brick from 1910. Our contractors came up with a solution that was even better than what we had imagined. We repaired some portions, which was very expensive, and painted the wall solid white, stripping that paint off layer by layer to create the current washed effect. That helped to blend the new and (very) old brick.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom needed updating, too. It was really old with a weirdly-shaped, very deep, mini tub. We installed a beautiful regular-sized tub and shower tile I had seen in another project our contractors had done, which I loved. I pushed hard to put in a double-wide mirror, even though there were a lot of issues with making a recessed cabinet fit the space. I&#8217;m glad I persevered because it makes the room so much bigger.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h5>A bedroom transforms into personal hobby spaces</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marco and I have always believed in having our own spaces. We divided what used to be a huge bedroom into two separate spaces to create his office and my closet. Marco needed his own space where he could work on his hobbies without driving me crazy! He likes to do things that create dust and noise and play his music really loud. He works hard during the week, so he should have a place to do that! The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office is actually soundproofed</a> so he won&#8217;t wake the baby.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32176 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-couch-blue-wall-painting" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-723x482.jpg" alt="blue couch and blue painting on wall and brick wall with metal open shelf" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, Sweeten was great; they continually checked in with us. I knew I could go to them if there was ever an issue with our contractor. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you need to pick finishes in person whenever possible. It&#8217;s really hard to imagine what crown molding, counters, or other elements look like on a computer screen.</p>

<h3>Moving back to the city</h3>
<p>We relocated back to Manhattan several years ago after residing in the Midwest and South for work. It was simply time to return home to our families in the Tri-State area. Bob and I met in NYC while studying for our MBAs, and Bob grew up here. While away, we owned several single-family homes—a few we had renovated—so we weren’t strangers to the process. There was a high likelihood of renovating to make a space our own as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we started the buying phase</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44562" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1.jpg" alt="NYC renovation portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>We rented for a few years until we located an apartment on the Upper West Side that would satisfy our love of prewar architectural details while accommodating modern living. Our home was purchased through an estate sale and we immediately started renovating. It had been updated in the early ‘90s, when the owners created an open floor plan of living room, dining room, and foyer which was a big draw for us. And there are two windows in every room except the bath, so the light was a huge selling point.</p>
<div></div>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Mapping the &#8220;musts&#8221; for an empty nest renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While Bob rents office space, I required a fully functional home office in a dedicated space. Also, a washer/dryer. We lived without them for a few years in Manhattan after having a laundry room in suburban homes, and we didn’t want to do that ever again. Both the kitchen and the bath needed better functionality and major cosmetic updates. Storage was essential throughout the apartment, as well as better lighting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our vision for the apartment was classic and period-appropriate but updated for today. We felt it was important to keep within the prewar aesthetic, including subway tiles, wood flooring, wide baseboard and door frame moldings, classic single-panel doors, radiator covers, and shaker-style cabinets.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44566 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-19.gif" alt="closet turn home office" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>More storage and a tip for staying cool</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The primary bedroom initially had a large double-door closet. We flipped it to be used in the second bedroom next door as a home office. We created built-in drawers and cabinets, as well as added new closets to account for the one given to the home office. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I loved ditching the tub for a large shower stall and completely rearranging the primary bath. We went for a custom industrial-style shower screen, mosaic floor tiles, and classic subway tiles with a twist: a crackle pattern. Plus a black metal grate for heat. The design worked.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">I sourced what I needed at the onset so we weren&#8217;t crunched for time in selecting and getting product delivered in time.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Electrical rewiring was not expected, but it had to be done. Then we replaced all the lighting and added ceiling fans in the bedrooms and kitchen. It’s a trick from the south because you can cut down on A/C bills. And it’s a plus in a prewar building where you can’t regulate the heat in winter.  We went for sleek, custom radiator covers that are great for display on top, too.</span></p>
<p>In the foyer, we extended the closet out by six inches and added shelving on top. So what was non-functional became completely utilized, with tons of space. We added bookshelves in the living room—we love books and are avid readers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44554 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg" alt="stainless steel kitchen counter" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Enlisting Sweeten during a hurdle</h3>
<p>Bob would say the stainless steel countertops surrounding the range are a throwback to a &#8217;50s kitchen we had. Those tops are indestructible! It was the only design element he wished to have a “say” in. Bob is the expert in paint colors. I can give him a palette of 10 colors and he can narrow them down so that they flow together from room to room.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While we had renovation knowledge, every experience has its unexpected nuances. We were very relieved to have <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten as the backstop</a> when needed. It was great to have someone who could assist in holding the contractors accountable. </span><span class="s1">We had problems with the contractor with a leak after moving in. So parts of the kitchen had to be dismantled, the leak fixed, and put back together again. <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> stood by us and made sure the job was completed correctly. </span></p>
<div></div>
<h3>When planning for the unexpected pays off</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I wish I had engaged Sweeten to talk through the contract, which might have avoided several issues. Having a second set of eyes is never a bad idea! For example, while I was very specific on the type of cabinetry I wanted, we found the budget in the contract did not align with reality. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To help alleviate the overage, I hit the sales.  Also, I sourced what I needed at the onset so we weren&#8217;t crunched for time in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selecting and getting product delivered in time</a>. Additionally, we had allocated extra funds for overages and the unexpected.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our new home makes us feel joyful. Our daughter commented that the space is aesthetically a culmination of all of our past homes, with a bit of industrial thrown in. It’s truly who we are at this stage of life, a mix of the past and present: kids grown, empty nesters with a puppy in the house!</span></p>

<h3 class="p5">Landing the perfect space</h3>
<p class="p4">We had a clear vision from the day of the close: to create a living space with a look and feel of casual luxury. The building, in historic DUMBO, is a block from both Brooklyn Bridge Park and the waterfront. The apartment is a true two-bedroom—with windows and natural light in both—overlooking the street and trees. The price point was reasonable enough that we could buy the condo and have money to renovate before moving in. Mitzie is a furniture designer and we were confident the space was a good canvas. It would make a good home.</p>
<p class="p5"><b><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16.jpg" alt="open concept kitchen and living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41443" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></p>
<h3 class="p5">New home office, featured wall panels, coordinated bathrooms</h3>
<p class="p4">We were looking to add character to each room, with a focus on mixed materials and quality finishes. We were excited about renovating the kitchen as well as two bathrooms using the same tile in different ways. The master bedroom would be outfitted with wall paneling. Maximizing storage was key since Mitzie works from home. The second bedroom would be her workspace, and she wanted (needed!) to separate work from life with an office. We were determined to accomplish it all, transforming the condo into a home reflecting both our personalities and styles.</p>

<h3>A mood board emerges</h3>
<p>Once we’d hired our Sweeten contractors—and asked a lot of questions about costs and the timeline—we began with concept boards. These kept us organized with the number of decisions we had to make throughout the planning. We started with a set of detailed floor plans and measurements (CAD renderings were helpful for seeing the big picture). The color palette was off-white, blue, and gray, with accents of pink in textiles and black for hardware. We created a list of materials we wanted to incorporate such as marble, brass, and wood. All of these hues and surfaces are visible in our living room, which is the heart of our place.</p>

We installed <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/should-i-refinish-my-hardwood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white oak wood floors</a> throughout the apartment to lighten up the entire space. It has a subtle, scraped texture that feels wonderful to walk on barefoot. Since the same wide floorboards were used throughout the apartment, we eliminated the saddles at our door thresholds to maximize that continuity. We made a schedule for ordering materials and a checklist for received items—a system that carried us through the renovation, helping us track appliances, fixtures, hardware, and odds and ends.</p>

<h3>The key to open concept spaces: built-in cabinets</h3>
<p>The kitchen was a dark and boxy room that needed love. Our goals were to maximize storage, update the appliances, and simplify the overall aesthetic. This was especially important as the kitchen opens to our living room. A large island was a key addition, to function as a dining and entertaining area. We chose a refrigerator and freezer with panel doors matching the cabinets. On the other end of the kitchen wall, our contractors removed the door frames holding the washer/dryer for a streamlined effect.</p>

Our apartment was filled every day with a team of busy contractors and subcontractors. It surprised us, but once the project was complete, we missed seeing and chatting with these talented guys.

<h3>Wall paneling defines a plain wall</h3>
<p class="p1">Wall paneling was added to give our bedroom depth and character which became a feature. This accent wall moved the attention away from some existing buildouts in each corner of the room, and a recessed area that could not be reconfigured. Our contractors hired a master carpenter who created the wall paneling with 2 1/2&#8243;-wide lengths of plywood, and finished the wall with satin-finish paint. In this room as well as the second bedroom, which became Mitzie’s office, we added custom closets and remote-control blinds. Mitzie’s plants in her office were outfitted with grow lights to keep them green year-round.</p>

<p>We found a great tile company and chose the same style for the floors in both bathrooms but installed in different patterns. Our big goal for the master bath was to add a double vanity—a tight squeeze and ultimately a feat, since we didn’t find a 60-inch-wide unit with storage that we both liked. The vanity we chose has no cabinets, but luckily, during demolition, our contractors pointed out an extra 6-8&#8243; in depth between the wall studs—space for hidden storage. The carpenter who’d created the bedroom paneling custom-made a four-door, concealed built-in. The shower recesses and door saddles are cut from the same marble slab as the kitchen countertops.</p>

<h3>During the renovation process</h3>
<p>Throughout the renovation, our Sweeten general contractor proved critical in the job’s technical aspects. Their invaluable suggestions included creating a dropped ceiling to add recess lighting, hiding wires and cables, adding electrical sockets and USB plug-ins, and installing dimmers. Our apartment was filled every day with a team of busy contractors and subcontractors, including painters, an electrician, a carpenter, and a plumber. It surprised us, but once the project was complete, we missed seeing and chatting with these talented guys. Sweeten helped us find our renovation team and advised us on important points like timelines and communication strategies.</p>

Mitzie and I didn’t know how hard conveying a bathroom-tile design over FaceTime could prove—the flooring almost broke us up! But a five-month renovation is survivable, even when in the end you are living out of a suitcase at a dear friend’s house. In the end, we were thrilled with our relaxed and beautiful apartment and proud of our role in making it.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Jenifer and Mitzie, for sharing your home with us!</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting started on commercial renovations can be both an exciting and overwhelming time. Perhaps you’re launching a business you’ve been dreaming about for a long time, or, if that dream has already proven successful, you’re expanding (congratulations!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches business owners to the best general contractors and helps the renovation stay on track, offers these guidelines for taking on commercial renovations, whether you are gearing up for an office build-out, a restaurant, retail space or some other venture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We based this article on New York City, but it has relevance to wherever you are in the country. The majority of US states base their codes on guidelines from the International Code Council. Cities and towns also have similar procedures when it comes to requirements such as building permits and Certificate of Occupancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few ways to get a head start with your own research. For example, taking a look at your potential building&#8217;s Certificate of Occupancy (CO) or browsing through online building records to get an idea of existing violations. Once you are seriously considering either buying or leasing a property or renovating what you have, that’s the right time to bring in a pro—an engineer, an architect, or a good or knowledgeable general contractor—so there are no surprises down the road.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few things to consider before unleashing the sledgehammer, and in some cases, signing a lease.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40003 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/HowSweetenWorks.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="50" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review the certificate of occupancy</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Number one, two, and three on your checklist before even committing to a lease should be: check the CO, check the CO, and check the CO. The document shows what you can legally use a property for—an office, a private residence, a restaurant, etc. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Here’s a <a href="https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/bsqpm01.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> to search in New York City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changing a CO is a costly process and, in some cases, it’s impossible to shift it to another use, according to Mercedes Hernandez from S&amp;M Expediting. Expediters are an optional addition to your building team to speed up the slow grind of permits, especially for commercial renovations in bureaucratic cities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We get a lot of calls after the fact when they start the process of getting necessary licenses. That’s when they realize they have a problem,” she said. One client signed a lease with the intention of turning a space into a gym. However, the certificate did not allow for a health club in the premises. That client is still trying to change it and it has already been 12 months. The easiest route is to lease or buy a space where the CO fits your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COs can also dictate smaller issues. For example, if you want to use the property’s backyard for additional restaurant seating, the certificate needs to specify that this is allowable. Otherwise, the CO will need <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/cofo_guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updating</a>. Smaller additions such as this are a much easier fix than a change in the legal use of a property, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><br />Understand existing violations on your property</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Especially if the property you’re eyeing hasn’t changed hands or had a new tenant for some time, it’s possible it already has building violations. It could be that someone did work without a permit, installed a rooftop AC unit incorrectly, or the fire sprinkler system isn’t functioning. “When you go to get a permit, these things are scrutinized and discovered,” explained <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. If the violations aren’t corrected, that could mean a costly stop-work order on your construction project later on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To kickstart this process, like COs, city councils often keep online databases where you can search open violations, when a permitted job was last completed on a building, and what that job was. Complaints about the building—such as work without a permit or a business operating without the correct CO—might also give you a hint at what violations you could encounter. The good news is with a commercial lease it is common to get these violations taken care of by the landlord, but the lease needs to specify this, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While you might get a sense of a building’s open violations from your own research, it’s unlikely you will spot every one of them on your own. The best plan is to walk through a potential location for your business with an architect, engineer or a GC, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Mark</a>, another Sweeten general contractor. That pro will help you decide if a property is a workable fit for your vision, he said. It’s also something that pros often do as a complimentary service to potential clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you need to determine if your property can handle the weight of your business. And in some cases, we mean that quite literally. Hernandez’s example illustrates the point: if you want to flip a clothing retail space into a car showroom, it’s a wise idea to make sure the floor can support the added weight. Or how about creating an open-plan office that’s perfect for teamwork? Before drawing up those plans, you need to know what walls are load-bearing and if they can be moved. If moving that wall (or not) is a deal breaker, it’s best to know the capabilities of a space before signing on the dotted line. “You need to ask what are the limits of design,” said Sweeten contractor Colin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessing the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEPs) situation is crucial especially if you’re turning a space into a food establishment with a kitchen. Gas, plumbing and electrical will be under more pressure, so can the property’s existing infrastructure handle it, or is an extensive overhaul required? If it is, prepare your budget and timeline realistically. That’s <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/nycbe/downloads/pdf/nycstarter_guide_restaurant.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another reason</a> besides the existing CO that some business owners take the express route of leasing a property that was previously a restaurant. While it&#8217;s not a given everything will be up to code (don’t forget those existing violations), it is easier and cheaper than starting from scratch.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Checking on a building&#8217;s envelope</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An envelope is building speak for whatever separates the outside from the inside—windows, doors, roof, etc. It’s another area worth looking into before starting your project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessibility for the disabled is often overlooked. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair. While many older buildings may have had their compliance grandfathered in, major commercial renovations could <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2006/rpt/2006-R-0335.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trigger</a> the need for properties to line up with the ADA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other areas that could change the scope of your project include asbestos in window glazing, which would need to be replaced. A property that is a landmark or in a historic district could also <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/lpc/index.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impact</a> if and how you can alter your building’s facade, including doors and windows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What are your facility requirements?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most health codes will require an employer to provide access to toilet facilities. For offices, this could mean a shared bathroom on a floor, according to Hernandez, the expediter. “They have to make sure employees have access to a bathroom from within the building,” she said. One client suggested sending employees to another building, but this was not permitted under the health code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The size of a food establishment will likely determine how many bathrooms are required for patrons (some sort of bathroom access is always required for employees). In 2012, New York City actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/nyregion/rule-shift-cuts-restroom-requirements-at-new-york-restaurants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowered</a> the required bathrooms, permitting small cafes, restaurants, and bars with fewer than 31 seats to have one bathroom, not two. Those with fewer than 20 seats are <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not</a> required to provide a bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like any project, commercial renovations that are well planned and equipped with the right team of people can be exciting. Just be sure to consider these five areas early to keep your renovation on the straight and narrow.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064728861"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>What is a certificate of occupancy?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A certificate of occupancy (CO) is a document that details what someone can legally use a property for, and the limits to which the property can be changed for that use. For example, a CO could state that a property can be used as an office, a private residence, or a restaurant. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Sometimes, it is possible to change a CO to cover a different use, but this can be costly and time-consuming.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064746876"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to renovate a commercial building</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">First, review the certificate of occupancy. This will tell you what you are legally allowed to use the building for (an office space, a residence, a gym, etc.) Then, research whether there are any existing violations on the property. Review the space with an architect or contractor, and check for unpermitted work. Also review the structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work. Will you be able to move walls? Can the current flooring support your business use? Make sure the building’s envelope–the windows, doors, and roof–are in good working condition. Consider people with disabilities. Is there a way for wheelchair users to enter the building? Lastly, understand your facility requirements, like mandatory bathrooms.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03-600x400.jpg" alt="conference office table" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone wp-image-45503" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>(Above) A <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/an-nyc-office-renovation-to-expand-working-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new commercial office remodel with Sweeten</a> for an NYC-based tech brand</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps you have outgrown your home office or coworking space or maybe your business is in need of a fresh location or configuration. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office renovation</a> will give you a chance to dream long-term about where your business is heading and interpret that direction into blueprints for a space that will facilitate growth. In this guide, we&#8217;ll consider the many pieces of your office renovation cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An office renovation can be as simple as an improvement project that is negotiated between the landlord and the tenant before signing a lease. Often these are very basic renovations such as fresh paint and some new walls that the tenant ultimately pays for in the cost of the lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are after something more custom, there are, of course, many variables that will determine the cost per square foot. Is the location a new or old building? Was it previously an office? What part of the country will your office be in? What are your business needs? And what quality of work will match those needs?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new building with a basic build-out of carpet, paint, and lighting, including equipment such as a photocopier and coffee machine costs about $40 a square foot, according to <a href="https://42floors.com/us/nv/las-vegas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42Floors</a>, a national search engine listing real estate for office space. On the higher end of the scale, a build-out with finishes such as wood veneer doors and a stone reception desk could hit $100 to $150 a square foot. The office renovation cost could also increase if you are renovating in an older building where quirky spaces and issues, such as slanted floors, must be taken into account. Whatever your tastes and needs, here are budget line items to consider.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs to hire an architect for an office renovation </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people will choose to hire an architect or designer. Expect that to take 20 percent of your renovation budget, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Carla</a>. That could mean $40,000 of a $200,000 budget. Bringing in a design professional early on may save heartaches in the long run. Along with the overall look and feel of the project, architects can also take care of code issues, assess if the workspace size will be comfortable for the number of employees, ensure handicap accessibility, design custom work areas, and more. “You can express creativity and individuality,” said Carla.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office lighting and electrical costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While planning an office remodel, first consider who will be coming to your office, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3218">Anthony, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. If clients are making regular visits, “you don’t want it to look like you’re working out of a bomb shelter,” he said. Decent lighting is one of those elements you can use to impress your clients, an impression that will hopefully lead to more business. Basic lighting can cost about $250 a point (a light with a switch is considered two points), according to Anthony. For each 110 volt outlet, put $150 in your budget, and don’t forget things like lighting for emergency exit signs, which are about $300 each, according to the website <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Move Your Office</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for millwork and finishes in an office</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is another area where you can keep costs down while still wowing potential clients with your new office space. “I’ve done work in lawyer&#8217;s offices where inside it is a vanilla box with cubicles that the clients never see,” said Anthony. “Then you have a lobby and conference room that is decked out with custom woodwork and imported marble.” One sample office budget at Buildings.com put the cost of millwork and finishes at about $25 a square foot. The total office renovation cost for that build-out came to $90 a square foot.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWIyD5_VuQ8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40888 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs to build walls</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similar to lighting and millwork, walls can differ greatly in cost. A basic partition wall that is ten linear square feet could cost around $60. Glass walls are not often priced per square foot and are instead sold as a package. However, using executive design elements such as glass walls could push the entire cost of your office renovation towards the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/64oqcghu49v4txd/Kirksey_ConstructionCostUpdate_2015_0.pdf?dl=0%20Paint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$150 </a>a square foot range.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office flooring costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commercial-grade carpet or a vinyl tile can cost <a href="https://naiglobal.com//journal_item_attachments/000/551/662/original/construction_costs.pdf?1421682262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as little</a> as $4 a square foot to supply and install. Wood plank floors can <a href="https://www.remodelingexpense.com/costs/cost-of-plank-flooring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost</a> around $7 a square foot for a 5,000-square-foot office. If there will be an industrial theme in your new office, then concrete flooring might be an economical option starting at $2 a square foot, according to the <a href="https://www.concretenetwork.com/concrete/interiorfloors/cost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concrete Network</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office bathroom costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many office buildings will have a communal bathroom area on each floor for tenants. If there is no bathroom, you must install at least one. <a href="https://americanrestroom.org/the-united-states-code-of-federal-regulations-for-toilet-facilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US code</a> requires one bathroom per one to 15 staff members. That climbs to six bathrooms for 111 to 150 staff.  A single restroom could cost a little under $15,000, according to <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Move Your Office</a>. If your staff likes to shower at work after jogging or riding into the office, a shower (make sure it is handicap friendly as per the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>), will cost just shy of $6,000.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace14-600x388.jpg" alt="" width="725" height="468" class="alignnone wp-image-30090" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace14-600x388.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace14-300x194.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace14.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /><em>(Above) The office kitchen and go-to snacking area from <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/dominos-new-office-is-so-domino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domino&#8217;s NYC office renovation with Sweeten</a></em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office kitchen costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An office kitchen can help team members feel appreciated. In the office renovation cost outline at the end of this article, Sweeten contractor Anthony installed an office bathroom and kitchenette. The total budget for those two items was around $16,000. The kitchenette, which consisted of a sink and fridge, took about 25 percent or $4,000 of that budget. Because the kitchenette and the bathroom were near each other, the project made double use of the plumbing to reduce overall costs. “It really depends on how much plumbing and millwork you need,” said Anthony. “You could have a simple cabinet or a whole countertop with a microwave, fridge, and sink.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fire protection</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on the building you are leasing, this could (hopefully) already be in place. If there is a sprinkler system, it is well worth spending a few hundred dollars to have an engineer inspect it to ensure it works and that it is up to current code. Installing a system from scratch in a small to a medium-sized office could set you back between $5,000 to $10,000, according to Anthony. He estimates that a sprinkler system will cost about $200 per sprinkler head, plus an additional $2,000 to have a plan drawn up as well as permits and inspections.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HVAC for offices</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping an office well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature can have a big impact on employee productivity. So, installing an HVAC—heating ventilation and air conditioning system—might be worth it if there isn’t already one in your new location. An HVAC system could cost between $15 to almost $30 a square foot or 15 to 20 percent of your entire office renovation cost, according to the Builder’s Association.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Labor costs for an office remodel </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a typical office renovation, labor should take about <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ten percent</a> of your entire budget. However, consider the geographic differences in labor costs. For example, the cost of labor in New York City is 70 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/costs/kitchen-remodeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr</a>. Philadelphia is 40 percent and Dallas ten percent above the national average. Charleston, South Carolina, and Scottsdale, Arizona, are both one percent below the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certain factors in individual cities can add another variable. For example, in New York City, there are union and non-union buildings. For union buildings, tenants are required to use union labor, which can almost double the office renovation cost of a project, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. The basic build-out of an office in a non-labor building can be as little as $40 a square foot or as much as $100 a square foot in a labor building, according to <a href="https://42floors.com/edu/space-buildout/gauging-the-cost-of-an-office-build-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42Floors</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, a real budget for a 5,500 square-foot office renovation in NYC from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Paul</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30365 mb-0 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>It was brimming with potential: a corner, prewar loft on a main street in Greenwich Village. The apartment took full advantage of its southern and western exposures with oversized, industrial windows that wrapped around two sides of the loft. Much of the space was open-plan with 14-foot-high ceilings; a mezzanine above the kitchen is accessible via a charming spiral staircase and can be used as a guest bedroom or home office.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30366 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before02-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft21.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30417 mb-0 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft21-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>The homeowner saw an opportunity to add value to the apartment by taking advantage of its structural beauty and abundant natural light. The building was converted in the late &#8217;70s from an industrial manufacturing space into residences and the unit had been relatively untouched since. Parquet wood tiles and warped cork would be replaced, and the decades-old kitchen and bath desperately needed a makeover. A few tweaks to the layout would also maximize the space to its full potential as an investment and a primary residence. He decided to go for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30368 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft11-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft15-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30406 mb-0 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft15-1-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After purchasing the co-op apartment, the homeowner lived in it for six months before renovating. Modern finishes would be a more suitable backdrop to the gorgeous natural light that poured through the six oversized 10-foot windows. He also decided to use pocket and barn doors for a seamless look and flexible use of spaces. Enter <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors. The homeowner <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/18338" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted his project</a> and was matched with a Sweeten design-build firm, and they got to work to fulfill the vision.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30370 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before01-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30373 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, they ripped out the kitchen’s outdated Formica counters and &#8217;70s-era cabinets, and completely gutted the old bathroom. The kitchen ceiling was cut away from the windows by about 18 inches to make more of the windows visible. An entryway closet was reduced so that the view from the kitchen window could be seen from the entrance of the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The floor on the mezzanine was also pulled back from the window and outfitted with a railing along its edge. The hardwood was repainted; the ceiling was scraped and painted, setting the stage for a guest bedroom, office, and additional closet storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30371 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft02-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30372 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft04-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen’s standout feature is the Carrara marble backsplash and 2-inch-thick countertops with a waterfall edge. Ikea cabinets with blue-gray fronts offset the white marble and are adorned with simple hardware in a satin nickel finish. On the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peninsula</a> side of the kitchen’s U-shaped counters, refrigerator and freezer drawers are tucked discreetly underneath to reduce visual clutter and maximize space efficiency. A stainless steel undermount sink is matched to an industrial faucet and sprayer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the side of the peninsula that faces the living room, the ledge of the counter was extended to create a space for bar seating with built-in 12-bottle wine storage as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft09-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30426 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft09-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30375 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft08-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30377 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft10-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the homeowner chose to continue the marble theme with herringbone floors, a warm subway tile on the walls, and the same 2-inch-thick Carrara marble from the kitchen as a counter. With a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frameless glass divider</a>, the deep soaking tub does double duty for baths and showers. Three well-placed niches, including one inside the tub area, add storage for toiletries and small décor objects.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30378 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before04-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30418 size-chrono" title="guest room and office" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft20-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30382 mb-0 size-chrono" title="guest room and office" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft01-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom, which benefits from one of the apartment’s enormous west-facing windows, was slightly reconfigured. The previous owners had installed floor-to-ceiling shelving with a library ladder, which was a good concept but needed to be scaled back. In its place, the Sweeten contractor built open shelving across the length of the room, keeping it within the overhead space so that it didn&#8217;t narrow the feel of the room. When its sliding doors are open, the space feeds into the living room for an open feeling. When the doors are closed, however, there is total privacy in the bedroom.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft19.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30380 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dressing room and closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft19.gif" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closet</a>, which was initially small and located inside the room, was relocated into a newly-created walk-in dressing room between the bedroom and bathroom. The homeowner wanted a closet with plenty of space on three walls for clothing and accessories. The design is perfect for couples, allowing one person to sleep peacefully while the other is getting ready for the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the apartment, the outdated flooring was replaced with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural white oak</a> in 7-inch-wide planks. Sourced from Vermont, the new floorboards—long rift and quarter-sawn—show a &#8220;tigering&#8221; striped effect and are perfectly suited to the space, making a stylish first impression.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mixing luxurious touches with economic ones, the Sweeten team was able to achieve the modern and fresh aesthetic that the homeowner imagined. What did he learn from his renovation experience? “Hire the right contractor and stay very close to the project. I feel like I made every micro decision, but it worked out! The unit looks great and I am a happy customer.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A renovation and decor overhaul were naturally in the plan when stylish design magazine Domino sought out a larger office in Midtown Manhattan for their 40-person team. They called on Sweeten for a general contractor who could carve out distinct and creative areas from a light-filled but blank open space, including a reception area, a photo studio, and a kitchen camera-ready for cooking demos. A complete build-out that was outfitted with pops of wallpaper, velvet seating, and decor galore, the result was a comfortable workspace for editors and guests alike.</em></p>
<p><strong>PROJECT</strong>: <em><a href="https://www.domino.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Domino</a></em> moved to new offices to accommodate their growing company</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you find Sweeten and what made you want to try the service?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Beth Brenner, <em>Domino</em>:</strong> A few colleagues were sitting around one afternoon contemplating partners for our new office reno. We were moving into an old sewing factory so we knew that we had walls to build. Our wish list also included a photo studio and studio kitchen where we could create food and entertaining content on an ongoing basis. But what we didn’t know was how to find a contractor to work with nor how to start the project! Our marketing manager asked if I had ever heard of Sweeten and proclaimed, “They are so on-brand for us.” Five minutes later, I sent a blind email to team@sweeten.com and, before the day’s end, Sweeten’s director of communications, Kerry O’Brien, responded. Seems the enthusiasm to work together was completely mutual!</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Why did Domino move offices?</p>
<p><em><strong>Domino</strong></em><strong>:</strong> We needed more space for our growing company—the best reason there is!</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How does your new space reflect your brand?</p>
<p><em><strong>Domino</strong></em><strong>:</strong> We set out to design a creative oasis that was full of light and energy—a chic space that felt at once casual and elevated, much like the <em>Domino</em> brand. While the furniture itself has a modern feel, the soft pink walls and mix of accessories and art really warm up the rooms. And, for an element of surprise and delight, we installed a Missoni-wallpapered “good vibes” phone room where team members can find a few minutes of peace.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What are the favorite aspects of the new space?</p>
<p><em><strong>Domino</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Because there is only one conference room, it was important that the space be flexible and that distinct areas be carved out for smaller meetings, private phone calls, and visiting guests. Various “nooks” were created where people now gather, the most notable of which are the Anthropologie-infused reception area and, of course, our beautiful new kitchen, which was designed and built by our Sweeten contractor. As in every home, it’s the primary gathering spot!</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What kind of work desks does everyone have?</p>
<p><strong><em>Domino</em>:</strong> The desks themselves are all the same—modern white tables, mint green file cabinets, and cushion-y off-white chairs from our good friends at CB2—but it’s been fun to watch everyone on the team personalize their own space. There were also many requests for standing desks, so we added two adjustable desks from BDI and placed them in a central area so everyone could rotate through.</p>

			<h2>Need WFH space? Add a nook desk to any kitchen or studio apartment, like these homeowners did</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2.jpg" alt="living room desk nook mid century" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38155" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost two years after the global shutdown, it seems likely the workplace will never look like it did before COVID-19. More companies and employees are exploring the hybrid model of work (part work-from-home, part in-the-office) or full remote on a permanent basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Makeshift &#8220;lap offices&#8221; are upgrading to become permanent home features. And limited square footage is no longer a hindrance. The creativity of carving out a nook desk is growing. Whether a built-in nook desk or a desk area for a studio apartment, see how these Sweeten homeowners have reinvented their workspace.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches residential renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering know-how, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Built-in kitchen office nook for ultimate convenience</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-25.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39893" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-25.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-25-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-25-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura and Randy first saw their Upper East Side</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-op, they weren’t impressed. It felt cramped and not their style. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with their contractor, they decided to open the space between the kitchen and dining room, adding a large island. A built-in desk niche would be accessible for when they worked from home. It would also serve as a homework station for their daughter, Mor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gan, as well. The result is a stylish and convenient small nook that holds court in the kitchen.</span></p>
<h3>A kitchen office nook with maximum organization</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg" alt="open kitchen and dining space" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40958" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08.jpg" alt="desk niche" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40964" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/family-homecoming-hudson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erin and Chris&#8217; 1950s co-op</a> left a lot to be desired.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It was on the smaller side, so they got creative with the layout to ensure they could get all the “extras” they wanted. They worked a built-in desk and cabinet system into their plans. This allowed the couple to organize their work as well as have a neat and tidy place for the kids’ schoolwork and art supplies. Even with a full kitchen and bathroom renovation, the new kitchen office nook is still Chris’ favorite part of the home.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A former closet turns into a desk in a studio apartment</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27739 size-chrono" title="desk nook in Lauren's studio" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg" alt="home office" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>After relocating her clothing storage to a larger space, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren&#8217;s Sweeten contractor</a> added a custom desk nook to the spot where her old closet stood. Three simple slabs<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>two deep shelves above and a desk surface<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>do the job.</p>
<h3>A modular desk in a living room adds functionality to a wall</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27740 size-chrono" title="Vitsoe modular unit" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="home office" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>A Vitsoe modular unit was the perfect way for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/mid-century-mad-men-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom and Alex to create an organized desk nook</a> in a sunlit corner of their living area. Its clean lines and silhouette blend seamlessly with the home&#8217;s mid-century style.</p>
<h3>Creative nook desk in a studio apartment</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27741 size-chrono" title="desk nook in Emily's studio" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="home office" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily&#8217;s new office nook</a> desk replaced two small, unusable closets. The desk in the studio apartment, which provides storage for papers and books, is an ideal workspace in her small home since it’s down the hallway from her sleeping area.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-24-v2.jpg" alt="Kensington, renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38725" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-24-v2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-24-v2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-24-v2-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-24-v2-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/featured-slider/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbra and Sean lived in their apartment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a while before deciding what to renovate. Their kitchen would be completely updated. In the existing kitchen, there was a desk area already so it just felt natural to carve out a similar area specifically for this use. Luckily, they were able to find a new desk that fit the opening perfectly. They spruced it up even more with leftover wallpaper from their foyer refresh. Now, they have an inviting place to work.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: What is Fool’s Gold Records and how did the brand begin?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ben Jacobs, Fool&#8217;s Gold Records:</strong> The company was founded by two DJs, A-trak and Nick Catchdubs, as a Brooklyn-based record label in 2007. We&#8217;ve morphed into a retail brand and a bit of a marketing agency, but first and foremost we&#8217;re a record label.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26311 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-Before-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="1085" />Original retail shop on Metropolitan Ave in Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: What led to the opening of a brick-and-mortar store?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR: </strong>We felt it was important to have a retail presence as an extension of the brand and the art that we create. Our first retail store and offices were actually in the same space on Metropolitan in Brooklyn. We were making tee shirts and either selling them online or tossing them off stage at shows. We decided, “Let’s take advantage of this space and open it up to the public.” It was a success and just came to a point where we outgrew it and it was a little too small to do enough with it. I happened to walk by this building—147 Grand Street—and saw a big open space for rent. The wheels started turning and we decided to come up with a new space that was more functional for how the brand was evolving.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How does your new retail space represent your brand? Why did you need to leave your former location? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR:</strong> The old space was very narrow. Everything was fixed and there wasn’t much room to grow. The idea for the new space was not only to be bigger but a little bit more modular. For events, we have the flexibility to pull the podiums out or move the DJ booth over a bit. We’re doing art shows, workshops for kids, and DJ workshops—a range that ties into New York’s creative, arts and music community.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26248 size-chrono" title="DJ booth" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-03-723x482.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26252 size-chrono" title="retail shop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How was your vision executed by working with Sweeten? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR:</strong> I worked closely with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Sweeten contractor</a> who did the work to make the space a reality. We had a pretty defined concept visually, but it was a bit up in the air in terms of how we were going to execute it. These enfilades that we’re sitting under, these three structures, were an experiment. We had to figure out how we were going to get the polycarbonate to stand and be sturdy and supported during events. Due to the nature of a lot of the materials we selected, there was a fair amount of trial and error and I appreciated the contractor&#8217;s willingness to experiment until we found the right methods and his patience throughout the process. We wouldn’t have been able to do that without him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">&#8220;The enfilades were a simple way to get a strong view right when you walk in. It also takes all the aspects of Fool&#8217;s Gold and puts them on display individually, sort of like laying out the ingredients for a recipe.&#8221; &#8211; Designer Dong-Ping Wong</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How did you, as a client, work with Sweeten?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR: </strong>We found Sweeten through our designer, Family New York. I definitely noticed how quickly and efficiently we were able to get bids and that it wasn’t a disjointed process. From the receiving end, it was like, “Wow! We’ve got a lot of general contracting options here, and a lot of good people who are interested in this job. Great!” It simplified the process and gave us a very strict and transparent way of comparing our options and what’s out there. During the renovation, there was a lot of communication with our Sweeten contractor—emails, calls, weekly meetings. He was very involved in the process and genuinely concerned with making sure it turned out exactly as we were hoping.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do you think Sweeten can help small business owners like yourself?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR:</strong> Sweeten helps business owners by simplifying and demystifying the process a bit. It’s pretty daunting if you’ve never been through the renovation process before. So you&#8217;ll have questions like, “Where do I start? What are the first steps? When do I know I’m done?” All these different questions you have going into it kind of blind. It definitely takes a bit of the edge off of figuring out what to do and if you’re feeling a little bit lost.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An architect dodged a shady general contractor in the nick of time and ended up with a perfect Sweeten home</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ana and Leo survived the complex process of selling their old apartment and buying a new one simultaneously—no easy feat!—but were nearly taken by an unscrupulous contractor when it came time to renovate. They realized that they needed someone they could trust to facilitate the search for general contractors and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors—</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">turned out to be exactly what they were looking for. (Their words, not ours!) Their Sweeten contractor helped them make layout changes and took on the challenge of creating an oversized sliding door system that allowed the conversion of an open office space into a private guest suite. Here&#8217;s how the couple transformed their Tribeca apartment from an awkward warren of rooms into an open, flexible space that is both comfortable and refined, including redoing the living room, office/guest room, dining space, bedroom, and of course the kitchen and two bathrooms.<br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25429 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22" width="1000" height="706" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-723x510.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-300x212.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Tribeca homeowner and architect Ana</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every real estate agent told us it could not be done. That, in New York, it was nearly impossible to coordinate the sale of our current apartment with the purchase of a new one. But my husband, Leo, was determined, so that is what we set out to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a long search and many disappointments, including lost bid wars and a contract that fell through, fate brought us an amazing real estate broker who made it all possible. <a href="https://www.kristiambrosetti.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristi Ambrosetti</a> was not fazed by the sell-buy challenge and helped us find our new home and sell our old one.</p>
<p>The apartment met all of our requirements—a 1,000-square-foot, 2-bed, 2-bath in a doorman building in Tribeca, with great light and plenty of storage space. The interior, however, was still in its original condition from the &#8217;80s; it needed a complete renovation to update finishes and fix layout issues that made the space feel choppy and awkward—the exact opposite of the contemporary open space we had hoped for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being an architect, I developed the initial plans for the renovation and met with several general contractors that claimed to be available for the job. After <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comparing multiple bids</a>, we were close to signing with one of them but decided to do some background checking first. I was shocked to find that the address listed in their documents was actually an empty storefront in Queens. The thought that we were very close to making a substantial down payment with someone that might not show up for the job really scared us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At that point, we took the search for general contractors online and came across Sweeten. We read about their screening process to find qualified professionals, and it sounded exactly like what we were looking for, so we decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg5YkmLFz4a5xkDfbtxLMvC7WWzQ">post our project</a>. From the beginning, the experience was surprisingly straightforward. Posting on the website was easy and we were soon matched with a few professionals. When we started interviewing potential general contractors, we were contacted by Miranda from Sweeten and she helped us through the whole process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the weeks we had spent interviewing general contractors, we also focused on finalizing the layout and decisions on finishes and fixtures. By the time we signed with our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDUErsavPF6GS1QXwyFWAiekS7sA">chosen Sweeten contractor</a>, we were ready to begin demolition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leo and I had been a little apprehensive about some of our design choices, especially when it came to the changes in the layout, which were intended to make the space more open and flexible. But when demolition began, it became clear that we were on the right track.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening up the kitchen</a>, the contractor also eliminated a narrow wall that partially blocked the entryway and made for a very awkward hallway. Squaring off the angled wall between the living room and the master bedroom made both spaces a lot more pleasant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The change that made the most impact, though, was opening the office (which would double as a guest suite) into the living room. Oversized <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding panels</a> would allow the room to be closed off and provide privacy for overnight guests. However, most of the professionals we spoke to thought the panels would be too heavy and could not be done. The Sweeten contracting team accepted the challenge and executed them beautifully.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The one setback we had during demolition was an unexpected electrical conduit found in one of the living room walls we had planned to demolish. The conduit ran down to the apartment below ours and, therefore, could not be moved. After conversations with the contractor, Leo and I decided to take down the rest of the wall as originally planned and leave only the section that had the conduit, creating a corner niche that was perfect for a bookshelf. Once the renovation was complete, this turned out to be one of our favorite features in the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One aspect that had drawn us to the apartment was a nook next to the living room that seemed perfect for a small bar. Early in the project, we pulled inspiration photos online and it seemed like designing the bar would be fairly easy. That was until we decided the bar should also house a concealed 40-inch TV, which then led to weeks of research and multiple drawing iterations until we landed on a design that met all of our functional requirements for both the bar and the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dining room pendants were another big challenge. The position of the existing light did not align with the center of the dining table, and we were not able to move the light because of the concrete ceiling. I had almost given up on having pendants over the table when Leo came across the Swell String fixture, which allowed for the pendants to be installed in any position, independent of the canopy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The finishes for the bathrooms and kitchen were also much debated. We knew from the beginning we wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble tile</a> in the bathrooms but looked at a wide range of patterns, sizes, and prices. Narrowing down the search to neutral tones and classic patterns, I eventually chose an Asian statuary from TileBar for the master bathroom and a Bardiglio herringbone mosaic for the guest bathroom floor, with the same Asian statuary in the shower. As a contrast to the traditional tile, I selected modern Duravit fixtures and Grohe faucets. The towel warmers had been at the top of our wishlist and after much research, we were able to find a small hardwired option that worked well in both bathrooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25010 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="general contractors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25008 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04.jpg" alt="general contractors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For our small <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">galley kitchen</a>, we chose the same low-maintenance quartz countertops we had in our previous apartment, paired with white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinets</a> and integrated Bosch appliances. The cabinets were finished with black linear pulls with accent walnut shelves added on the back wall for some extra storage. The backsplash was probably one of the toughest decisions—with so many interesting materials and patterns to choose from, we considered all sorts of options, from large back-painted glass panels to intricate mosaics. As a way to balance the modern cabinets and countertops, we decided on marble subway tile from TileBar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our main goals for the master bedroom were to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/bedroom-storage-style-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximize storage</a> and improve circulation. So the swing bedroom door was replaced with a pocket door, improving access to a long wall of closets that ended in a small custom-made vanity at the corner of the room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Leo and I found that all the time spent obsessing over the small details really paid off—it all came together as we had hoped and we were very happy, not only with our choices but with the quality of execution and expertise the Sweeten contractor and his team brought to the project. Most importantly, knowing Sweeten was following the project, and touching base with us periodically gave us peace of mind through the whole process.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A couple creates their dream home with walnut wood floors, a spa bath, and enough kitchen storage to turn heads</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">A year-long search—involving a specially-written code!—led Jonathan, a consultant, and Cecilia, a social media strategist and <a href="https://cecibeautytherapy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">beauty blogger</span></a>, to a mid-century co-op apartment in Queens. The unit was in a serious state of disrepair, with cracked doors and windows and a dangerously unstable kitchen countertop. Read about how the couple changed the floor plan, turned a powder room into a full spa bath, and created a space to suit their lifestyle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24316 mb-0 size-chrono" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Prior to moving in together, Jonathan and his girlfriend, Cecilia, were each living in Manhattan on the Lower East Side. The criteria for their search? He wanted a large space and a fixer upper with a good school district; she wanted the convenience of a supermarket, shops, and a subway stop close by. Their budget had them looking in Windsor Terrace, Forest Hills, Sunnyside, and Hamilton Heights, in addition to Elmhurst. For their search, Jonathan used his background in quantitative finance to adapt code that he had written to find his first apartment in 2008, which scoured the major real estate websites for properties that fit their fairly strict criteria and price range. The code took into account various factors, such as home value increase over time, new developments, transit efficiency, growth in commercial investments, and the neighborhood’s increasing value over five-plus years. When this apartment came up—roughly a year after they started searching—it was way under budget, and the couple pounced on the opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The space was located in a very convenient neighborhood in Elmhurst, with shops and necessities nearby and just a 25-minute subway ride from midtown. They purchased the 1960s-era apartment with the intention to renovate. The reasonable price meant there was enough left over to splurge on the renovations, so they planned to add their own personal touch with high-end finishes. At roughly 1,300 square feet, the 3-bed, 1.5-bath co-op was more space than they expected to find, and the layout allowed them to implement some drastic changes to make the space more usable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/before-floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24365 size-chrono" title="before floorplan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/before-floorplan-723x760.jpg" alt="before floorplan" width="723" height="760" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/after-floorplan-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24374 size-chrono" title="after floorplan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/after-floorplan-1-723x760.jpg" alt="after floorplan" width="723" height="760" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24318 size-chrono" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-01-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24319 mb-0 size-chrono" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Jonathan and Cecilia could see that the apartment had good bones. Despite the positives, it was extremely outdated and many things—such as the cabinets, heaters, windows, and doors—were falling apart. The kitchen counter would teeter if you placed any weight on it, and would even come off its foundation if you pressed down. The previous owners had done unpermitted renovations in the past, and the apartment had not been well taken care of. The original layout had long narrow halls, closets in weird places, a closed kitchen, and cramped rooms. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Initially, Jonathan looked for contractors on his own, until an architect friend told him about Sweeten. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">He posted his project</span></a> and wrote up his description. He said, “I received a lot of quick responses—more than me going out on my own, and the bids were much more competitive than any from my own research. The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Sweeten contractor</span></a> that I went with was a one-stop shop for everything. He had an architect, a designer, and a project manager—they pretty much did all the heavy lifting. They were super responsive and took care of a lot of the issues that arose throughout the process. Knowing that they have been vetted through Sweeten definitely gave me peace of mind.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Jonathan and his Sweeten contractor set out to solve problems related to space usability and efficiency, and to make the apartment feel more open and modern. They decided that if a wall could be knocked down, they would do it. They turned hallways into closets and closets into open spaces. They also wanted to convert the half bath into a second full bath—Cecilia already claimed the first one, so Jonathan needed one of his own!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24322 size-chrono" title="before kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-Before-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="before kitchen" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-During-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24321 size-chrono" title="during renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-During-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="during renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24325 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24324 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Given their preference for clean lines with modern touches, they did not want too much in terms of the built-ins and crown molding. “The kitchen was the part of the renovation we were most excited about. Because Cecilia loves to cook and I like to entertain, we wanted people to naturally gather around the kitchen for good food, good drinks, and good times,” says Jonathan. With dark furniture in the rest of the apartment, they went for white shaker cabinets, gray-white texture on the backsplash and white counters with a bit of speckling for an overall contrasting look. Appliances were stainless steel and marble was installed wherever possible. An incredible amount of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> and counter space was added, with every inch of space maximized.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-08-11.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24327 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-08-11.gif" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-13-14.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24326 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-13-14.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A pull-out spice rack</a> and deep drawers were among the storage solutions they chose. “Having those large drawers for pots and pans with the ability to customize the holders was a must. A floor-to-ceiling pantry with pull-out drawers made our snacking life that much easier. We decided on open shelving in select areas to make the kitchen feel more open. A pass-through was also created, so a spot on the living room side was used for counter seating. We wanted large appliances to really be the wow factor in our kitchen. I love our five-burner stove—especially the griddle!—and our massive fridge and great dishwasher. Having this generously proportioned kitchen and large-scale appliances has been amazing, especially compared to our previous apartments,” explains Jonathan.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24330 size-chrono" title="before bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-Before-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="before bathroom" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-During-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24329 size-chrono" title="during bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-During-04-723x482.jpg" alt="during bathroom" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24331 size-chrono" title="bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-15-723x1085.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24332 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the original full bath—Cecilia’s bathroom—they went with a white theme. She wanted it to be bright and classy, so they chose glossy white marble <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tile for the floors</a> and large-format porcelain tile for the walls, with an accent wall of marble 2-inch subway tile laid in a herringbone pattern. This gave the space more texture and made it feel more custom. They also added a niche for toiletries and bath products.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24333 size-chrono" title="spa bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17-723x1085.jpg" alt="spa bath renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24334 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spa bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-18-723x1085.jpg" alt="spa bath renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the second bath, Jonathan added a large shower by taking some space from the master bedroom closet. “Since it was my bathroom, I had full reign and wanted it to resemble a spa.” The Sweeten contractor added slate tiles throughout, as well as a pebbled shower floor and a large shower panel with rainfall and waterfall features. In both baths, they installed tankless <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilets</a> per co-op requirements.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Throughout the apartment, they had originally planned on going with light bamboo flooring. When their Sweeten design/build firm sent over samples of both light and dark wood, however, they fell in love with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dark walnut flooring</a> from Triangulo. For the office space, they decided on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French doors</a> to allow some openness between the living room and office, while providing privacy if needed when Jonathan worked from home in the evenings.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The biggest challenges of the project related to changes to their original design: “A lot of it was due to unforeseen circumstances,&#8221; Jonathan explains. &#8220;The original broker stretched the truth about where pipes were, what construction was done legally, what was underneath the floors, as well as what we would be permitted to do. We originally had a plan that was going to be signed off, but once we contacted the live-in super, problems started to arise. We had to do two to three different drafts, which caused scheduling delays as well as caused friction with the co-op board and staff. The entire process took about two months just to get approval because of these issues. Eventually, we got everything set up, and once construction started, there were only a few slight hiccups. Everything went fairly smoothly.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">After finishing the renovation, Jonathan’s recommendation to future renovators is to be open and flexible with the initial vision. “Most people have an idea of how exactly they want things, and are unwilling to do something different or new. That’s good but rarely does your budget or space allow you to have everything that you want. I originally wanted to remove some of our closets because I thought we had too many, but my girlfriend and designer suggested that we keep them for both value and utility. Having lived here for six months, I can safely say that I’m glad we kept the closets.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Jonathan feared that the end product wouldn’t match up to his vision. He and Cecilia have very different design aesthetics, and he wasn’t sure if they would mesh well together. “In the end, I think the apartment has a good flow and calming color tones, which is something nice to come home to after a hectic day. Another big question I had was whether we could actually do everything in the timeframe the contractors set out—about four to five months. It was an ambitious schedule, and while there were small items that needed to be addressed after we moved in, they were minor. In the end, we completed the project on deadline, and are very happy with how it turned out.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How to maximize space at home: use transom windows, pocket doors, custom walls and more</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Open floor plans are all the rage—so much so that the first temptation of a renovating homeowner may be to tear down walls. But before you bring in the wrecking ball, consider if you&#8217;ll have enough personal space for your family (or frequent overnight guests), and how a strategically placed wall or partition can maximize your space at home while defining the private areas of your home. Take cues from these Sweeten homeowners and their clever uses of space, from carving out niches and capturing square footage in other areas to adding moveable partitions for smooth transitions.</span></p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-interior-wall-of-windows-brings-light-to-this-guest-alcove/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deeksha and Joe&#8217;s</a> windowed wall and guest bedroom.</p>
<h3>Transom windows allow for a guest bedroom to be added</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an L-shaped living room in their new apartment, Deeksha and Joe saw the opportunity to create a guest bedroom. All they needed to do was add a wall and a doorway. The only problem was that the placement of the wall would block the light and hide a gorgeous view from the corner windows. A unique solution—an interior wall of windows—provides the necessary privacy for the guest bedroom while still allowing the flow of light to reach the rest of the living room. The new space also serves as a light-filled workspace for the family.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/studio-grows-into-junior-one-bedroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claire and Dan&#8217;s</a> junior one-bedroom with sliding doors</p>
<h3>Custom sliding doors to help maximize a 500 square-foot home</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Claire and Dan purchased their 500-square-foot studio apartment, they knew it needed a renovation. The unit hadn’t been updated since the &#8217;60s, and the couple wanted to build out a junior one-bedroom by separating the living/kitchen area from the sleeping space. With DOB regulations preventing permanent wall additions, they worked with their architect and Sweeten general contractor to install custom sliding doors. With the sliding doors, they maximize their space at home by keeping the space open during the day, and closing them for privacy or while entertaining. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44845" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14_compressed.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14_compressed.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14_compressed-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14_compressed-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Walter&#8217;s</a> expanded, angular kitchen in Park Slope</p>
<h3>Strategically removing a hallway adds space (and light!)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long hallway was the main culprit of wasted space in Walter and Laura’s Park Slope apartment. By removing their entry hallway, they imbued their apartment with more natural light</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and space. With the newly-provided footage, their kitchen swapped places with a spare bedroom and got an expanded, angular footprint in the foyer. A small dining/entertaining area was also added to the kitchen, allowing guests to visit with the couple while they cooked. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Adding a wall creates a new bedroom, while transom windows let in soft light</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The notion of adding a dishwasher to their kitchen escalated into a full gut renovation, and then took another, unexpected turn when Chris and Amber found out their second child was on the way. The project was now an opportunity to carve out a room for their older son. A wall was added to separate the dining nook from the rest of the kitchen, turning it into a bedroom, and a milk glass transom window was installed above the doorway to allow light to filter through. Finishing touches; a crib, picture shelves, roller blinds, and a colorful rug complete the transformation from dining nook to a growing boy&#8217;s bedroom.</p>

<h3><strong>A studio morphs into a one-bedroom with the help of a full dividing wall</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New homeowner Paul landed his perfect apartment by getting creative in his search: instead of buying a “true” one-bedroom apartment in Hell’s Kitchen, he purchased a studio that was listed as a junior one bedroom. Paul noticed the apartment’s previous owner was already mimicking a one-bedroom layout by using a built-in bookcase to separate the bedroom and living area. He replicated this layout in his renovation by having this general contractor add a full dividing wall (with a pocket door) to separate his living area from his bedroom. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Turning a studio into a two-bedroom (yes, really!) with movable partitions </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal planned on making their studio function as a two-bedroom; not an easy feat, considering the apartment’s existing open-plan layout. They added a custom king-size platform bed in the space designated as the master bedroom. The key feature, movable partitions, allow it to work as a space for sleep or as another part of the home. For the &#8220;second bedroom,&#8221; a queen-size Murphy bed that folds up horizontally to save space and a closet were installed in the area designated as the living room, which uses the same sliding doors for privacy. As an added bonus, the wall unit that houses the pull-out bed and closet blends into the surrounding walls when the bed is tucked away.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/millennial-sisters-buy-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deanna and Daria&#8217;s</a> two-bedroom transformation</p>
<h3><strong>Major wall movement reshapes an entire 700 square-foot apartment layout</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn one bedroom into two, create a walk-in closet, and make a dining space fit for hosting: these items topped the to-do list for sisters (and roommates) Deanna and Daria’s renovation in New York’s Sutton Place. To really maximize space at their home, construction moved walls from the existing dining room, living room and bedroom to reshape the new rooms: nearly the entire space of the apartment. Now, their 700 square-foot apartment maximizes every inch of space while showcasing the sisters’ preference for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bold patterns and color. </span></p>

<h3><strong>To maximize space at home for a new baby, walls &amp; a doorway create a nursery </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to make their one-bedroom apartment family-ready, Karen and Kevin set their sights on converting a dining nook situated at the tail end of the kitchen into a nursery for their daughter. They added a new wall and doorway, which allows  for entry from the main living area. The new nursery, now completely separate from the kitchen, receives a flood of sunlight during the day, an added benefit from the window it inherited from the former dining area.</p>

<h3><strong>A retractable partition create privacy for parents and children in a one-bedroom</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A one-bedroom in a coveted neighborhood inspired Casey and Kumar to maximize space at home for their four-person family. After examining their family’s daily routines, the couple decided to give their sons the master bedroom so that they would have a space for playtime and bedtime. They added a multipurpose space in the living area with a wall of custom millwork and a pull-out bed. This became the space that Casey and Kumar could sleep and store their clothes. To preserve privacy and block light and noise, a retractable partition now divides the designated sleeping space from the rest of the home. The addition of the partition now offers flexibility for the family&#8217;s daily needs.</p>

<h3><strong>Need your one-bedroom to be a two-bedroom? Demo a closet, build a partition, add a door. Voila!</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way, Lindsay and Matt needed to turn their one-bedroom into a two-bedroom apartment. They planned to do this by splitting the existing bedroom into a master bedroom and nursery. A few key layout changes made this all possible: demolishing closets to gain back valuable square footage, building a partition, and creating a doorway that opened into the living room. These newly constructed spaces have allowed the home to reach its full potential by making room for the whole family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Last year, Lindsay and Tim bought their first home together<i>—</i>a sprawling two-bedroom apartment on Central Park West. The couple—a medical student and financial analyst, respectively—saw the potential to create an incredible home for themselves, but had a list of renovation items to tackle first. With Sweeten&#8217;s help, they created a classic but thoroughly contemporary apartment with room to grow. By updating their existing kitchen and baths, they carved out new spaces for living, working, and entertaining. Read on for how they reconfigured walls to add an expanded office, a half bath, </i><em>AND bonus storage space </em><i>to their prewar apartment! </i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23151 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Upper West Side homeowner Tim Laurie</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After purchasing our first apartment together in June of 2016, my wife, Lindsay, and I decided to take on a co-op renovation in order to make it our perfect living space. We were attracted to the location and design of the 1929 Art Deco building on Central Park West, but the interior of the apartment left a lot to be desired. The 1,500-square-foot home offered a very spacious feel, with nine-foot ceilings and light coming through windows on three sides of the apartment. The layout, however, was dated and not very efficient. The “before” layout consisted of a cramped corner kitchen, large but divided living and dining spaces both of which had duplicate doorways on both sides, old en-suite bathrooms, and a dark walk-in closet converted to a cavernous office space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23304 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Before-and-After-Floorplans.001-720x540.jpeg" alt="Before and After Floorplans.001" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23305 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Before-and-After-Floorplans.002-720x540.jpeg" alt="Before and After Floorplans.002" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When planning the new layout, first and foremost, our renovation needed to address the practical features that were lacking. Specifically, we wanted: 1) a toilet that didn&#8217;t require guests to venture on an embarrassing trek through a bedroom in order to get to an en-suite bathroom; 2) more usable space, such as a den or optional third bedroom; 3) a washer and dryer in the apartment; and 4) a larger, but not galley-like, kitchen. With the help of Sweeten, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/10047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> and went with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contractor</a> that stood out as most reliable, reassuring, and within our cost estimate. We initially interviewed five contractors for our project, and received three quotes. Our contractor was not the least nor the most expensive, but he offered to include the finishing touches on our apartment to ensure we got the most out of our renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23378 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Manhattan renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-2-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23154 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23156 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23157 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest change in the kitchen was changing the entrance from a narrow doorway to a wide foyer and pass-through, allowing us to add a bar area, more counter space, and plenty of light. Our contractor helped us with the kitchen layout and where to place the washer/dryer so it connected to our water lines. We went with stainless steel Frigidaire appliances, adding a separate bar fridge under the counter to make up for a shallower built-in refrigerator that we chose. A stainless backsplash tile with white grout and slate gray floor tiles contrasts well with the white custom cabinets and brushed nickel handles throughout. We love the custom wine rack, glass cupboard, and bar shelf on one side of what used to be a duplicate doorway. A powder room—formerly small storage space—was also installed off the kitchen with double half doors, to take up less clearance space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23158 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23159 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of design, we wished to open up the main space by removing the mirrored french doors and a wall blocking the light between the living and dining rooms. For a modernized look, our plan included staining the hardwood floors, painting and papering the walls, and adding crown and floor molding. <span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">living room</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we removed the non-functional decorative plaster fireplace and the walls between the living and dining rooms to open up the main living space. A large dining room table from Pottery Barn (which nearly didn&#8217;t fit up the elevator) and chandelier sit between the bar and new office door. In this same area, we were able to build a third bedroom/den with french glass doors for light to shine through.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our en-suite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bathrooms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned out beautifully, with our master bath getting floor-to-ceiling tile in the shower and on the feature wall, as well as a custom-built vanity and top-mounted sink. The white, tan, and natural sand colors flow nicely into the main bedroom, which also got repainted. The guest en-suite bathroom is filled with clean white subway tiles and Carrara marble flooring, as well as an ebony vanity with matching Carrara countertop. Although the renovation progressed well from our standpoint, the contractors had their work cut out for them! They had to cut back old bathroom tiling and build new walls. We also had to replace old bathroom plumbing within the concrete deck floors, which was unexpected, but handled well by the subcontractors that our Sweeten contractor hired.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23307 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-15-723x1084.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-15" width="723" height="1084" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23308 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-16-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-16" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slightly expanded but cozy and carpeted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">office</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a bonus room for studying and work, accessible through the new matching french doors off the dining room, rather than from the bedroom hallway. The office neatly fits our double desk and two chairs, as well as a bookshelf. A new transom window in the hallway allows more light to shine through. </span>We were especially excited about a tweed Edinburgh gray wallpaper that we chose for the entrance foyer, which makes a big statement right when you enter the apartment. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least is the updated &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">garage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; where we leave the bikes, storage, and our cat&#8217;s litter box. This storage room was coated with a fresh coat of white paint and new gray tile as well, giving it a clean look despite its utilitarian purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Overall, we are very pleased with the renovation of our Central Park West co-op apartment. At the end, we decided to add extras along the way, which extended the project time frame by several weeks and stretched our budget slightly; however, our contractor did his best to complete these while not adding labor to the total bill. He was detail-oriented and very patient, despite a lengthy co-op approval process.</span><span class="s2"> The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team kept the work to a reasonable time frame of just over three months and were very understanding as we lived through the process.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 7 small apartment ideas are ideal inspiration for stylish storage and organization</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Living in a city where space is limited can mean giving up square footage in favor of location. Small apartments can feel restrictive; there&#8217;s less room for stuff and fewer zones that can be dedicated to specific functions. When your square footage doesn’t allow for an office, dining room, or storage closet, it’s time to think outside the box. These clever small apartment ideas, brought to life from Sweeten renovations, prove that you can personalize your space to meet your needs in <em>any</em> size apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22053 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="white and black galley kitchen with yellow stools" width="1600" height="2401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01.jpg 1600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<h3>This small kitchen loses a radiator and gets a window seat (plus storage!)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/evelyns-sweetened-manhattan-co-op-homeowner-guest-post/">Evelyn’s</a> galley kitchen suffered from wasted space; there was a radiator beneath the window that was never used. She had it removed and replaced with a window seat with storage underneath, a suggestion given to her by her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228">Sweeten general contractor</a>. Now serving two purposes, the space provides additional storage and a dining nook that seats up to four.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-14.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22054 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="White and gray kitchen in studio apartment" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>A mini kitchen peninsula offers space for work and play</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/">Frans and Dalal’s</a> studio apartment, the kitchen offered very little workspace and barely any room for a table and chairs. By incorporating a mini peninsula into the new kitchen design, the couple was able to add extra prep space and a dining perch that’s perfect for the two of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22055 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11.jpg" alt="Prewar galley kitchen with counter and bar seating in living room" width="3744" height="5616" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11.jpg 3744w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3744px) 100vw, 3744px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>A galley kitchen pass-through creates much-needed counter space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A narrow galley kitchen in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/">Emily&#8217;s</a> studio apartment had virtually no counter space and nowhere to sit down for a meal. By extending the countertop through a newly created pass-through in the wall, Emily was able to define a spot for dining and enhance the social aspect of the kitchen by opening it up to the main living area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22057 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01.jpg" alt="Office and desk nook in closet" width="3744" height="5616" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01.jpg 3744w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3744px) 100vw, 3744px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>A coziest office nook makes its entrance in a small entryway</strong></h3>
<p>Having put a new plan in motion for her kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/">Emily</a> set her sights on a pair of shallow closets that took up valuable floor space in the entryway to her apartment. She combined the closets and carved out an office nook complete with a desk, chair, and open shelving for books and office supplies.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22058 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="Office and desk nook in closet" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Existing closet space in a studio swaps to become an office niche</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The previous owner of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/">Lauren’s</a> studio apartment had knocked out a large closet to create a workspace, replacing it with a tiny closet in the bedroom area. Lauren chose to swap the spaces during her renovation: the home office reverted back to clothing storage while the small closet—which turned out to be the ideal size for a workspace—became an office niche.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22060 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15.jpg" alt="Bed loft platform in studio apartment" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>A lofted bed platform adds clothing storage behind rich wooden tones</strong></h3>
<p>After successfully swapping the small closet for a larger one, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/">Lauren</a> worked with her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315">Sweeten general contractor</a> to think of other ways to add storage and reduce clutter throughout her apartment. In need of a place to store off-season clothes and a folding table and chairs for guests, her contractor rebuilt the existing bed loft platform, adding three bays of storage that were made easily accessible from the foot of the platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22059 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075.jpg" alt="Storage nook above closet in master bedroom" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>Make every inch count—especially if you have tall ceilings!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there’s no more room on the floor, the only way to go is up. To make the most of the 11-foot ceilings in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/west-village-co-op-renovation/">Elizabeth’s</a> apartment, her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/818">Sweeten general contractor</a> suggested using the space to create more storage—an idea she couldn’t say no to. Rather than shoving things under the bed, this alcove is the perfect solution for tucking things out of sight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">—</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amber and Chris made their space work for them by transforming their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/chris-ambers-bathroom-kids-room-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dining nook into a kid&#8217;s bedroom</a> complete with a transom window to allow ample sunlight to pass through.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">John lived in his two-bedroom Hell’s Kitchen co-op apartment for practically a decade before addressing a number of areas in the home that had been neglected over time. Stately pre-war molding from the early 1920s was buried under years of paint, ancient water damage permeated some walls, electrical outlets were sparse&#8211;even door knobs were finicky. Ready to make significant changes to the kitchen, bedrooms, and book storage space just in time for Katharine to move in, the couple—both behind-the-scenes professionals in the entertainment industry—needed a crew to help transform their home into a modern day co-op with old-world charm. Read on for John’s take on their thoroughly ambitious home renovation!</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/john-and-katharines-sweetened-manhattan-apartment-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18042" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/katharine-apartment.jpg" alt="manhattan apartment renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/katharine-apartment.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/katharine-apartment-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by John, Hell’s Kitchen homeowner </span></i><span id="more-18013"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the apartment was largely in its original, 1923 state. We loved a lot of the classic details but many of them had begun to decay and the plaster walls were in various states of disrepair. It was increasingly difficult to keep clean. So, the primary goal was to restore the walls and floors to good working order, replace the trim and molding that was falling apart, and generally remove a lot of the cluttered and clashing elements that had built up over the years. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen had been redone at least once, probably in the late 90s, but the life of that renovation was ending and the cabinets were breaking and falling apart. We wanted to find a way to make the small kitchen/living room space work. We weren’t making substantial structural changes and wouldn&#8217;t be moving plumbing or gas, but the whole space definitely needed a general cosmetic and electrical make-over. So, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1939" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we posted our project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to find a design and construction team to take on the work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The living room, especially, was a challenge. It had a reasonably sized kitchen, which is great because I cook a lot, but finding a way to balance the space between kitchen and living room without shortchanging either was really the central problem we tackled. It had previously been semi-divided by a wall and an island which left the corner around the couch dark and cramped, and still didn&#8217;t allow for a full-sized fridge. We removed the wall and created a central island that could function as both a work space and a dining table. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I splurged on a dual-fuel Wolf range, which was right up against the realm of possibility given the amount of available power to the apartment, but which I&#8217;m pretty happy about (a gas stovetop is basically essential, as far as I&#8217;m concerned). The refrigerator is a 32&#8243; french door model, not quite &#8220;full sized&#8221;; I found the unit that offered the most storage volume but which could still physically fit, with the doors removed, into the small freight elevator in our building. We originally had a slightly larger model that did not fit. I toyed with recruiting friends to help me carry it up to the tenth floor. In retrospect, this probably would have been a mistake.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The microwave is also Wolf; they make a unit that opens like a drawer and can be loaded from the top, rather than the traditional swing door style. It&#8217;s a little silly but this allowed us to install it in the kitchen island facing away from the front door, rather than in the more normal spot above the stove. I don&#8217;t use the microwave a ton and it seemed silly to give it that front and center pride of place; better to have the nice custom cabinet-fronts there.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We got fairly traditional knobs and miscellaneous hardware; we used unlacquered brass for the &#8220;living room&#8221; side of the main room and nickel for the &#8220;kitchen&#8221; side as a way to differentiate the shared space. We love the brass; the original knobs and apartment hardware are all nearly 100-year-old brass, and we specifically sought out the unlacquered pieces, which seem a little less common, because our hope is that over the years they will patina and start to take on some of the character of the old ones. Most of our miscellaneous hardware pieces are from Simon&#8217;s Hardware and Bath, and we&#8217;ve been pretty happy with them. We got slightly funky drawer pulls from Urban Archaeology, which were pricey, but which we really love. The pendant lights are from O&#8217;Lampia, a shop on the Bowery; the guy there makes custom pieces that we both really like, and we would enthusiastically recommend him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen faucet is Rohl, less expensive than the ubiquitous Waterworks (which is what I used for the bathroom renovation in 2008) and supposedly, at least according to our plumber, more reliable. Lever handles are key for me for a kitchen faucet, since it&#8217;s difficult to turn on cross handles with your elbows when your hands are covered in raw chicken. Having the spout elevated as high above the sink as possible is also pretty important to me, it allows more space to work when washing dishes (no dishwashers allowed in my building!).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would count our (very consciously UN-oiled) blue/green soapstone on the kitchen island among our riskier&#8211;but ultimately most rewarding&#8211;design choices. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the apartment, we wanted to maintain as much of the pre-war character as possible, while also lightening and opening up the space. There was picture frame molding partway up the walls, which we replaced with crown molding at the ceiling. The style is similar but it makes the ceilings feel higher and complements the many beams without calling too much attention to them. Most of the choices we made were along these lines, classic in style but slightly more understated than the original as befits a fairly small apartment. We refurbished and kept original elements where we could, like the heavy doors and metal door frames.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We built in a lot of shelves and cabinets in order to maximize space and we opened-up the awkwardly placed living room closet (originally blocked by the couch) to make a kind of library/office nook that also makes the space feel larger.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18038 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18045 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-18034 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-11.jpg" alt="office nook" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-11-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For non-decorative lighting in the smaller spaces, we went with simple schoolhouse ceiling fixtures that are pretty similar to what was originally installed, again with brass accents. To fill out the three rooms, we also added track lighting, which is perhaps a little unusual. They are fairly unobtrusive and allow a lot of coverage, flexibility, and directionality while staying as close to the ceiling as possible (we would have had to drop the ceiling to install in-ceiling lights). We accented with warm-tone, high CRI LED fixtures in places where they could be installed, like in cabinets, the hallways, and in the kitchen.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, we&#8217;re thrilled to be back on a renovation site under construction where we met up with new tS members, interior design firm, Mendelson Group. The team at Mendelson is a small, closely-knit group of young designers and project managers, lead by firm Principal, Gideon Mendelson. The team&#8217;s portfolio is so rich with interiors that are highly personalized and utterly distinct, we could hardly wait to get behind the scenes to learn more about their process! We caught up with the designers during a check-in meeting with their Upper West Side clients. Qian &amp; Mike, a pair of young professionals, hired Mendelson Group after purchasing their 2000 sqft, 3-bedroom condo, looking to renovate the new home for themselves and their expected newborn.<span id="more-10320"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="house-floor-plan-sketch" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48009 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-9.jpg" alt="hard copy or print out of floor plan sketch of a house with a pen on a table before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-9-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon purchase, the condo had modest details and finishes &#8212; it was the type of space you&#8217;d expect to find in a contemporary residential development in Manhattan. For Gideon&#8217;s team and the new homeowners, the goal was to create a stylish, yet functional space with updated finishes &amp; details, focusing much of their attention on gut renovating the kitchen &amp; master bathroom, and creating a fully-custom home office for the working couple.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="apartment-during-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48006 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-6.jpg" alt="apartment with large windows and radiators during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-6.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-6-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we stopped by, the demolition work was complete, and construction was in the first couple weeks of a 4 month timeline. Here is a look into the main living space from just outside the new office &#8212; straight ahead will be living &amp; dining areas, and back at the right is the kitchen, in its fully gutted form.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="kitche- with-window-during -renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48008 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-8.jpg" alt="kitchen with window during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The layout of the new kitchen will remain close to the original, while the functionality and materials of the space will become much improved. The designers will increase functionality with taller upper cabinets and an added pantry, just outside the kitchen&#8217;s threshold. They&#8217;ll also replace a set of upper cabinets that had previously blocked Hudson River views with floating shelves where the family can store everyday glassware. High-end materials for the new kitchen include custom lacquered cabinetry, and polished statuary marble counters &amp; backsplash, for a blend of modern and traditional aesthetics.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Architectural detailing throughout the new space will also mix modern and traditional style elements. When we visited, the designers had prepared this mockup of a traditional over-door and crown molding detail for the foyer space to show the homeowners. After comparing a few options, Qian &amp; Mike were pleased to approve the designers&#8217; proposal.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, Sara, from the Mendelson team, shows us some of the other material samples they brought to review with the homeowners. The direction of the decor combines neutral textures &amp; graphic patterns in a way that is fresh and unexpected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The samples in hand are the floor and wall coverings that will be used in the new library. The floor covering is a Stark carpet called “Tandy” in Marble, and the wall covering is a Phillip Jeffries paper called <a href="https://www.phillipjeffries.com/shop/wallcoverings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Gilded Age” in Breakers Blue</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="work-in-progress-of-a-room" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48007 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-7.jpg" alt="man working in a room with large window and radiator during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-7-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This room will house the library/home office &#8212; one of the spaces we are most excited to see completed. Here, the walls are being prepped for the Phillip Jeffries wall covering (previous photo). The library will also be outfitted with custom millwork in a bleached &amp; stained white oak; custom pieces include desks, shelving and paneling. Double-wide pocket doors along one wall will allow the space to be either closed off for quiet work time or opened up into the adjacent living room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We stumbled upon this wood stain sample palette inside a large closet near the master bedroom. When staining existing wood floors, Gideon&#8217;s team makes samples on site before making final decisions, to ensure that their clients get exactly what they want. After decisions are made, the samples are re-sanded and final staining takes place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Qian told us that she really appreciated that the designers are perfectionists; when it came to staining her floors, she said, &#8220;Gideon asked the contractor to try three different stains for us to look at. We all really liked the darkest stain, but Gideon thought some of the reddish undertones were still coming out and he wanted them to try another coat even if it would mean adding on an extra day to stain the floors.&#8221; In the end, that extra coat (the swatch on the bottom left) is the stain they chose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="tile-installation-in-bathroom" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48002 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-2.jpg" alt="bathtub and wall and floor tiles installation in a bathroom during renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-2-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We ended our visit in the master bathroom which, like the kitchen, is getting a full material upgrade. The finished bath will be adorned in marble &#8212; herringbone floor in honed Paper White and polished Statuary marbles, polished Dolomiti marble tiles on the walls, and  polished Bardiglio surfaces for the vanity top and tub deck.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We cannot wait to see this renovation finish up &#8212; many thanks to Gideon, Sara &amp; the Mendelson Group team for sharing!</p>
