			<h2 class="p1">Move over, beige. Mint green, sage, and celadon are delighting kitchens.</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-50800 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18.jpg" alt="light green kitchen cabinets with white countertop and black steel gas cooking range with hood and undermount sink with brushed nickel faucet and white walls after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Just right for a touch of color</h3>
<p class="p1">Finding light green in the home is a natural choice. The shade is so closely aligned with plants, trees, and the fresh outdoor air that it’s no wonder it brings comfort. We’ve been seeing light green kitchen cabinets—from mint green to light pistachio—remain popular over time earning their place as a dependable, go-to neutral.</p>
<p>Here, examples of how Sweeten homeowners are bringing this kitchen design trend to life.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3>From builder-grade to sage green farmhouse cabinets</h3>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="sage green cabinets and white kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56345" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Even though Abby’s building was newly-built, the builder-grade materials found in her kitchen weren’t feeling like home to her. In particular, she didn’t like the dark green cabinets but preferred a lighter, airier version of the color. The design she wanted was a farmhouse look for <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/sage-green-kitchen-sets-up-a-country-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her kitchen remodel</a>. Her Sweeten contractor worked with a subcontractor to custom-make Shaker-style cabinets.</p>
<p class="p1">“I had been thinking about green kitchen cabinets for a long time,” she said. “Sage green kitchen cabinets have color but are a tone that isn’t overwhelming.” Black fixtures and walnut shelves complemented the sage green.</p>
<h3>Light green kitchen cabinets in verdigris</h3>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18.jpg" alt="light green kitchen cabinets with white countertop and black steel gas cooking range with hood and undermount sink with brushed nickel faucet and white walls after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">The Sweeten homeowners of this 1882 Bronx rowhouse were Steve, a professor at the School of Visual Arts, and Lewis, a tax professional. Each floor would be made into an open concept, which required a true <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-bronx-rowhouse-remodel-for-work-life-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">townhouse gut renovation</a>. Everything was demolished down to the brick and joists.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The couple aimed for a design aesthetic of warm minimalism. Located on the middle level with the living and dining rooms, the kitchen cabinets were custom-built. The modern, flat-front panels were painted a hue that was of the palest verdigris. To create a unified look with other spaces in the home, the master bathroom upstairs also featured this color family in yellow-greens and gray-greens.</p>
<h3>A galley kitchen in mint-green</h3>

<p>Laura and Tim lived in their 1929 brick townhouse in Rego Park, Queens, for many years before deciding to renovate. They loved their home. However, it became what Laura called “grungy and old.&#8221; The kitchen had been damaged by a leaky shower from the bathroom above and needed new cabinets, flooring, and wall treatments.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-patio-house-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">couple turned to Sweeten for the overhaul</a>. Their contractor enclosed an outdoor patio connecting it to the back of the kitchen. With the introduction of skylights and a new color palette, the kitchen became a cheerful space for the family to gather.</p>
<p>Laura and Tim selected Shaker-style cabinet fronts in mint green. The hue “matches the feel of the old house but is also clean and modern at the same time,” said Laura. Moreover, the brushed bronze hardware and stainless-steel appliances provide a nice contrast. “The kitchen came out beautifully,” Laura said.</p>
<h3>Light green kitchen cabinets include agave</h3>

<p>Two years after buying their two-bedroom apartment in Queens, Gina and Andrew decided to renovate. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">couple wanted to fix the kitchen&#8217;s</a> small, awkward layout and create a space that would inspire them to cook.</p>
<p>The pair was inspired by the lovely mix of greens in their co-op courtyard. To bring this into their design, they chose beautiful lower cabinets in the shade of agave. Warm brass hardware stands out against the more muted green cabinets. “I never used to cook and after our renovation, I’m cooking up a storm,” said Andrew.</p>

<h3>Two designers compromise on color</h3>

<a href='https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/attachment/sweeten-maggierossadam-spiegel-apt-02/'><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-02.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="home renovation, kitchen renovation, open floor plan" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>

<p>Design is definitely in this couple’s wheelhouse. An interior designer and former architect, respectively, Maggie and Adam knew that they would have to make some <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">concessions when designing their own co-op</a>. Their focus: the kitchen.</p>
<p>Their kitchen was small and outdated. Luckily, they were able to make it much larger by removing the surrounding wall, changing the location of the refrigerator, and adding shelves instead of upper cabinets.</p>
<p>According to the Sweeten couple, the kitchen really revealed the way they communicated. “The kitchen shows the full-scale of compromise between our distinct design ideas,” said Adam. “For instance, the light green lower cabinets add the layer of color that fit her style, but have a gray tone that doesn’t stray from my own style.”</p>
<p>It was important to Maggie to “add a personal touch, warmth, and texture to the kitchen,&#8221; which they achieved through the mint-green cabinetry—a style that is classic yet contemporary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, I checked in with a few of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten&#8217;s</a> interior designers to see what&#8217;s taking shape in apartments across the City. I found simple and smart ideas that bring a fresh eye to any home. Below are a few spring-ready snapshots, highlighting some of my favorite themes:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8211; white basics and natural wood/green accents to freshen and organize a space<br />
&#8211; glass and lucite accessories as ways to lighten and brighten a space<br />
&#8211; mint and gold as new color update options</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Natural Accents and Easy Green Companions</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Design accents inspired by nature can go a long way to satisfy our desire for fresh air and extra daylight. Sweeten Expert Jill took this five foot East Village kitchen and made it gorgeous and functional with a singular focus on white kitchen and storage basics, highlighted with natural accents using greens and wood grains. This is a great reminder that the form of everyday kitchen basics can be beautiful and that low-maintenance plants like succulents and philodendron are super stylish options for areas that need warmth and color.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11209 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_springInspiration-10.jpeg" alt="interior-design-gold-glass" width="600" height="446" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_springInspiration-10.jpeg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_springInspiration-10-300x223.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Statements in Glass and Lucite</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m making an extra effort this year to appreciate the extended daylight hours that come with the season. Transparent materials like glass and lucite<span id="more-11206"></span> work in every room to amplify natural light, make a space feel more open, and provide function without a heavy visual effect. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3055">Sweeten Expert Michele</a> brought in a dining table that does double duty as both a substantial gathering spot and a weightless source of light in this Chelsea loft. The glass top plays up light throughout the room and draws attention to the neutral benches underneath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11211 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_springInspiration-02.jpeg" alt="interior-design-gold-glass" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_springInspiration-02.jpeg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_springInspiration-02-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3145">Sweeten Expert Danielle</a> added to the light, bright theme in this Woodside kitchen with glass and lucite lighting fixtures, decorative accents, and counter seats. Set against the natural palette of the cabinet and tile finishes, reflective surfaces around this kitchen lend a fresh, almost dewy, glow to this space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/402">Sweeten Experts Anishka and Niya</a> used glass and lucite accents to keep this Brooklyn bedroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/park-slope-apartment-interior-makeover/">featured on the Sweeten blog last year</a>, ultra clean and simple. With white bedding and transparent accents, your eye is naturally drawn to the window and the plant, creating a natural and serene tone in this room. <em>(Photos: Niya Bascom Photography)</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Fresh Color Updates</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Brooklyn, Sweeten Expert Jill was first out of the gate with two color accents that have started to emerge everywhere I look. Jill paired this super-charged mint green bedside cabinet with warm natural tones in the headboard, and found simple, chic gold and glass accents that feel a little retro and a little modern on the desk.</p>
