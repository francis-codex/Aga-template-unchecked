<p><em><span class="s1">Owner Mike Stamatelos felt a space to decompress from the outside world was needed and, as his debut in hospitality, opened Porcelain in the Queens, New York neighborhood of Ridgewood.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What is Porcelain?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> We’re an Austrian-inspired café in the heart of Ridgewood, Queens.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Where did the idea for the business come from?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> The desire to give folks a space to spend time with those they care about and mindfully pass time to think. I wanted to create a setting definitively separated from the outside world that gives people that space to appreciate the sights, sounds, and smells of everyday life. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the opening of this new brick-and-mortar space? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> This was both my first serious entrepreneurial venture and my inaugural introduction into hospitality. That said, the path to opening was marked by trial-and-error, sage advice from friends, and a great deal of uncertainty. Major thanks to Google. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Requirements for most major milestones and the steps to get to them were done through research and calling up people in the industry. The regulatory environment in NYC is necessary but very complex. At the end of it all, though, we opened strong and ready for business. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42982" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mike-Coffee-Shop-Seating-1.jpg" alt="Ridgewood cafe remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mike-Coffee-Shop-Seating-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mike-Coffee-Shop-Seating-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mike-Coffee-Shop-Seating-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do your new design and the materials represent your brand? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> The design, led by designer Elizabeth Ingram, is built off of a fictional story inspired by the history of the neighborhood: A century ago, an Austrian immigrant created a space that emulated his hometown cafés using humble means. It was “upgraded” by family through the generations based on what was popular at the time. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The result is a space that looks like it’s been here forever. We were very particular in the materials used to create something humble and honest, which is core to what Porcelain represents.</span></p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth:</strong> <span class="s1">We inherited certain important elements from the movie set left in the space by Martin Scorsese’s film <em>The Irishman</em>. The linoleum floor and the bar, both imbued the space with an early to mid-20th-century feel and we decided to embrace that era, but, instead of an old Irish bar, we felt that, in keeping with the neighborhood, we would look to the rich tradition of Viennese coffee houses with a humble grandiosity. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">We designed a space that seems to have nearly been unchanged for 80 years so that people felt like they had discovered a place that time had forgotten. One that had developed organically throughout decades, not designed last week and installed. The stenciled walls and tattered chandeliers bring a sense of ornamentation that has weathered the years and softened with age. The restroom is a bit more &#8217;70s funky, as though the third generation of the original owners had done some modernizing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have a great source for antiques and decorative items in Atlanta, so many of the light fixtures, hand-blown glass cake stands, and upholstered furniture were purchased in the area and trucked up. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do you think Sweeten can help entrepreneurial business owners like yourself?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> Navigating the construction process is a complete maze and working directly with a good contractor is helpful. There is a level of overall consultation that is needed for inaugural brick-and-mortar store creators, such as help defining and providing templates for the various stages of a project.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Can you describe the “before” space? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> The space was originally built in the first decade of the 20th century, with 12’ high original tin ceilings. The Boy Scouts met in it for decades, and it was most recently used as the film set for Martin Scorcese’s movie T<em>he Irishman.</em> The bar, flooring, and doors built for the movie were used in our final design. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What’s next for the brand?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> Aside from introducing a number of wonderful brunch and breakfast to-go items, we’re excited to start holding performances at the space during brunch on weekends!</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36785" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-04.jpg" alt="Union Square play, commercial renovation, design, construction, remodel, renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/union-square-play-commercial-property-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A playspace renovation</a> in Union Square by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4407" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Piotr</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting started on commercial renovations can be both an exciting and overwhelming time. Perhaps you’re launching a business you’ve been dreaming about for a long time, or, if that dream has already proven successful, you’re expanding (congratulations!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches business owners to the best general contractors and helps the renovation stay on track, offers these guidelines for taking on commercial renovations, whether you are gearing up for an office build-out, a restaurant, retail space or some other venture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We based this article on New York City, but it has relevance to wherever you are in the country. The majority of US states base their codes on guidelines from the International Code Council. Cities and towns also have similar procedures when it comes to requirements such as building permits and Certificate of Occupancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few ways to get a head start with your own research. For example, taking a look at your potential building&#8217;s Certificate of Occupancy (CO) or browsing through online building records to get an idea of existing violations. Once you are seriously considering either buying or leasing a property or renovating what you have, that’s the right time to bring in a pro—an engineer, an architect, or a good or knowledgeable general contractor—so there are no surprises down the road.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few things to consider before unleashing the sledgehammer, and in some cases, signing a lease.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40003 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/HowSweetenWorks.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="50" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review the certificate of occupancy</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Number one, two, and three on your checklist before even committing to a lease should be: check the CO, check the CO, and check the CO. The document shows what you can legally use a property for—an office, a private residence, a restaurant, etc. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Here’s a <a href="https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/bsqpm01.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> to search in New York City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changing a CO is a costly process and, in some cases, it’s impossible to shift it to another use, according to Mercedes Hernandez from S&amp;M Expediting. Expediters are an optional addition to your building team to speed up the slow grind of permits, especially for commercial renovations in bureaucratic cities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We get a lot of calls after the fact when they start the process of getting necessary licenses. That’s when they realize they have a problem,” she said. One client signed a lease with the intention of turning a space into a gym. However, the certificate did not allow for a health club in the premises. That client is still trying to change it and it has already been 12 months. The easiest route is to lease or buy a space where the CO fits your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COs can also dictate smaller issues. For example, if you want to use the property’s backyard for additional restaurant seating, the certificate needs to specify that this is allowable. Otherwise, the CO will need <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/cofo_guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updating</a>. Smaller additions such as this are a much easier fix than a change in the legal use of a property, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><br />Understand existing violations on your property</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Especially if the property you’re eyeing hasn’t changed hands or had a new tenant for some time, it’s possible it already has building violations. It could be that someone did work without a permit, installed a rooftop AC unit incorrectly, or the fire sprinkler system isn’t functioning. “When you go to get a permit, these things are scrutinized and discovered,” explained <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. If the violations aren’t corrected, that could mean a costly stop-work order on your construction project later on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To kickstart this process, like COs, city councils often keep online databases where you can search open violations, when a permitted job was last completed on a building, and what that job was. Complaints about the building—such as work without a permit or a business operating without the correct CO—might also give you a hint at what violations you could encounter. The good news is with a commercial lease it is common to get these violations taken care of by the landlord, but the lease needs to specify this, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While you might get a sense of a building’s open violations from your own research, it’s unlikely you will spot every one of them on your own. The best plan is to walk through a potential location for your business with an architect, engineer or a GC, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Mark</a>, another Sweeten general contractor. That pro will help you decide if a property is a workable fit for your vision, he said. It’s also something that pros often do as a complimentary service to potential clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you need to determine if your property can handle the weight of your business. And in some cases, we mean that quite literally. Hernandez’s example illustrates the point: if you want to flip a clothing retail space into a car showroom, it’s a wise idea to make sure the floor can support the added weight. Or how about creating an open-plan office that’s perfect for teamwork? Before drawing up those plans, you need to know what walls are load-bearing and if they can be moved. If moving that wall (or not) is a deal breaker, it’s best to know the capabilities of a space before signing on the dotted line. “You need to ask what are the limits of design,” said Sweeten contractor Colin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessing the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEPs) situation is crucial especially if you’re turning a space into a food establishment with a kitchen. Gas, plumbing and electrical will be under more pressure, so can the property’s existing infrastructure handle it, or is an extensive overhaul required? If it is, prepare your budget and timeline realistically. That’s <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/nycbe/downloads/pdf/nycstarter_guide_restaurant.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another reason</a> besides the existing CO that some business owners take the express route of leasing a property that was previously a restaurant. While it&#8217;s not a given everything will be up to code (don’t forget those existing violations), it is easier and cheaper than starting from scratch.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Checking on a building&#8217;s envelope</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An envelope is building speak for whatever separates the outside from the inside—windows, doors, roof, etc. It’s another area worth looking into before starting your project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessibility for the disabled is often overlooked. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair. While many older buildings may have had their compliance grandfathered in, major commercial renovations could <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2006/rpt/2006-R-0335.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trigger</a> the need for properties to line up with the ADA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other areas that could change the scope of your project include asbestos in window glazing, which would need to be replaced. A property that is a landmark or in a historic district could also <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/lpc/index.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impact</a> if and how you can alter your building’s facade, including doors and windows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What are your facility requirements?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most health codes will require an employer to provide access to toilet facilities. For offices, this could mean a shared bathroom on a floor, according to Hernandez, the expediter. “They have to make sure employees have access to a bathroom from within the building,” she said. One client suggested sending employees to another building, but this was not permitted under the health code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The size of a food establishment will likely determine how many bathrooms are required for patrons (some sort of bathroom access is always required for employees). In 2012, New York City actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/nyregion/rule-shift-cuts-restroom-requirements-at-new-york-restaurants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowered</a> the required bathrooms, permitting small cafes, restaurants, and bars with fewer than 31 seats to have one bathroom, not two. Those with fewer than 20 seats are <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not</a> required to provide a bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like any project, commercial renovations that are well planned and equipped with the right team of people can be exciting. Just be sure to consider these five areas early to keep your renovation on the straight and narrow.</p>

<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064728861"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>What is a certificate of occupancy?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A certificate of occupancy (CO) is a document that details what someone can legally use a property for, and the limits to which the property can be changed for that use. For example, a CO could state that a property can be used as an office, a private residence, or a restaurant. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Sometimes, it is possible to change a CO to cover a different use, but this can be costly and time-consuming.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064746876"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to renovate a commercial building</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">First, review the certificate of occupancy. This will tell you what you are legally allowed to use the building for (an office space, a residence, a gym, etc.) Then, research whether there are any existing violations on the property. Review the space with an architect or contractor, and check for unpermitted work. Also review the structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work. Will you be able to move walls? Can the current flooring support your business use? Make sure the building’s envelope–the windows, doors, and roof–are in good working condition. Consider people with disabilities. Is there a way for wheelchair users to enter the building? Lastly, understand your facility requirements, like mandatory bathrooms.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39606" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-02-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-02-1-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-02-1-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-02-1-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What is Babeland and how did the brand begin?</p>
<p><strong>Sharon:</strong> Babeland was modeled after its sister company, Good Vibrations, a women-founded sex-positive adult toy company that opened in San Francisco in response to the lack of women-friendly sex shops. The first Babeland store was opened in 1993 in Seattle, offering a safe, welcoming, and non-judgmental environment where customers could shop for sex toys and books, as well as attend workshops and inspiring events. The store&#8217;s popularity led to three more locations in New York.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the remodeling of your retail space?</p>
<p><strong>Sharon:</strong> The SoHo location opened in 2003, and after 15 years, it was time to refresh the store to stay relevant within the community and to improve the shopping experience for our customers. In the past year, we had increased our product selection dramatically and needed ways to present these products. We also needed a more efficient plan for storing product so staff could easily merchandise and restock the shelves. This meant moving inventory up to the sales floor. We created a storage room in the back that took up more square footage, but because of the new fixture plan and flow, the store actually feels more spacious and allows for easier navigation from section to section.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">I felt completely confident with the process, even with being close to 3,000 miles away from the project.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How does your new retail design represent your brand?</p>
<p><strong>Sharon:</strong> We were able to create better ways to showcase our large product selection and still keep the store feeling welcoming, safe, and fun. We used sleek tables and cabinets that allow our products to shine and encourage customers to explore. Customers can see more products through printed posters, mannequins, or display units; the shopping experience is much more interesting.</p>
<p>Our entryway has selfie stations where customers can have a little fun. They break the ice for those who may never have been to a sex toy shop or are apprehensive to enter. They allow customers to relax and realize that this can be a fun place to shop.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How was your vision executed by working with your Sweeten general contractor?</p>
<p><strong>Sharon:</strong> Executing a remodel from across the country always poses potential problems. This remodel was scheduled to happen at our busiest time of year, so I was unable to get to New York to meet with contractors. Once our contractor was selected through Sweeten, I presented scaled drawings of the changes needed for this project, and through phone calls and emails, we were able to get the project underway. It was very helpful having an outstanding area manager, Amy Carnegie, on site to act as a liaison when necessary. Once I arrived in New York, the final stages of the renovation were completed.</p>

<p><strong>Sharon:</strong> It had been years since I last worked with a contractor in New York, so I needed a reliable resource to help find a contractor that could execute the work required within our budget. I presented the job requirements through Sweeten’s website and immediately received responses. They matched us with quite a few potential contractors. Once we accepted a bid from our chosen contractor, Sweeten stayed in touch with me on several occasions to check on progress, and offer assistance if needed. <span style="color: #000000;">I felt completely confident with the process, even with being close to 3,000 miles away from the project.</span></p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do you think Sweeten can help entrepreneurial companies like yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Sharon</strong>: The services Sweeten offer are fantastic. The contractors have been vetted by Sweeten and clients can correspond freely with the contractors through Sweeten’s email system and make choices based on their particular needs. All this is happening while knowing the Sweeten staff are keeping an eye on your project. Regardless of the scope or budget of your renovation or build-out, Sweeten has a deep pool of talented contractors/designers they can connect you with.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening a physical brick-and-mortar store is a bold and energizing step. It’s a chance to create a walk-in version of&nbsp;a business you’ve been&nbsp;growing, or&nbsp;a tangible&nbsp;realization of a long-awaited vision to be your own boss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail renovation costs<span>—</span>for, say, a clothing or beauty boutique, yoga studio or art gallery can slide from pricey to economical&#8230;depending on what you want. Chain Store Age’s annual survey of retail build-outs put the average cost at $56.53 per square foot. If you use that formula, then it will cost $280,000 for a 5,000-square-foot store build-out. In another example, an entrepreneur in Austin, Texas, only spent $7,650 on a build-out for Little Green Beans, a children’s consignment store for clothing and toys, according to <a href="https://www.inc.com/articles/201108/business-start-up-costs-retail-store.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inc.</a>&nbsp;(The business owner&#8217;s breakdown of costs were: $4,000 construction to customize the space, $3,500 for shelves, racks, etc., and a mere $150 for a handyman).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t be too overwhelmed by this figure. As the name suggests, the&nbsp;above survey takes into account bigger stores that are more commonly found in malls than a Main Street space in an older building. A simple build-out for a smaller store<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>minor construction, a coat of paint, shelves, and racks<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>can cost under $10,000. It all depends on the scope of work and what finishes you want.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To figure out this wide world of retail build-out budgets for your project, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractors, offers a few areas to consider.<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<h3><strong>Design for a commercial storefront space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you choose to hire a designer or architect (not everyone does), expect that to take 20 percent of your renovation budget, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Carla</a>. That could mean $40,000 in a $200,000 budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail projects can be as small as custom shelving for storing product, using existing electrical wiring, and&nbsp;applying&nbsp;a fresh coat of paint. With a build-out that basic, you might avoid the need for permits, thus eliminating the need for blueprints to be approved by an architect. However, if you’re serious about optimizing the size of your space and carefully planning the customer experience, then it&#8217;s best to bring in the big guns. “What do you want the customers to experience? What do you want them to see when they first walk in?” said Carla. Then there are the more technical design elements like handicap accessibility and whether or not you need a bathroom. These are best handled by an architect.</p>
<h3><strong>Electrical costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Chain Store Age survey put the cost of interior lighting at $3.30 a square foot. As mentioned above, electrical can be kept simple by using existing wiring and even fixtures to keep these costs down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott, another Sweeten contractor</a>, has worked on retail build-outs where electrical has been as low as $10,000 or as high as $100,000. Splurges in lighting often come from a client wanting specific light fixtures that are in line with their brand. Altering the position of each light to highlight store product or fixing up existing, decrepit wiring could increase your budget for electrical. Once you get into more serious work, your project might also require the additional cost of applying for permits that could also delay your timeline, Scott said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And it isn’t just lighting that needs to be considered. If your business has additional power needs, such as a salon or a dog groomer with equipment like hair dryers, it is best to assess what power burden your ideal store location can handle before signing a lease. That way, you can either find another location or factor in an electrical upgrade into your budget if necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cjJnJjIEXOM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40884 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Plumbing costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p>This area of the budget will largely depend on:</p>
<p>A. Is there is a bathroom?</p>
<p>B. If no, then would you like a bathroom?</p>
<p>C. If you have one, will it stay in the same place?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a bathroom, then it is possible to freshen it up with a coat of paint. If there is no bathroom, you should consider if it will help your business and your staff (otherwise they might have to close the store whenever they need to use a restroom). “You want to keep customers in your store rather than give them a reason to leave,” said Scott, on why a bathroom might help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A very basic bathroom could set you back $3,000 to $6,000, according to <a href="https://home.costhelper.com/bathroom-addition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost Helper</a>. It could attract additional costs if the location is far from water and sewage lines and if you need the help from a structural engineer. A plumbing permit will also be needed. Moving a bathroom will gather similar costs with the added line item of demolition. If your business has unique needs like a washing station for a hair salon, that will be another cost to factor in.</p>
<h3><strong>Flooring and ceiling costs&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a retail build-out, flooring on average takes up $2.76 per square foot in a budget and ceilings take $1.81, according to Chain Store Age. If there are no structural issues with the flooring (again, check your lease to ensure the landlord is responsible for these costs), then what you do to the floors will likely just be cosmetic. If that is the case—you&#8217;re re-varnishing existing floors or laying some tiles—then the project likely won’t require a permit, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin,&nbsp;a Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>HVAC costs in commercial spaces</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of either fixing, replacing or installing an HVAC system costs on average about $2.61 per square foot or about $13,000 for a 5,000-square-foot space. Like everything else, this average can swing in either direction based on what you have, what you want, and what you can afford.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One way to avoid this cost entirely is to negotiate a lease that puts the responsibility of the HVAC system onto the landlord, according to Colin. As an alternative, you can volunteer to take care of the HVAC system and request that the landlord give you three months of free rent. If it is a simple step of replacing the air conditioning unit with something modern, it likely won’t require a permit, said Scott.</p>
<h3><strong>Millwork costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On average, retail build-outs spend almost $10 a square foot on display fixtures or millwork, according to the Chain Store Age survey. That’s roughly 20 percent of an average budget. But of course, it all depends on your vision for your store.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three factors that determine how expensive your displays will be are material, quantity, and what space they need to fit into, Scott said. The cost of simple wood from Home Depot will pale in comparison to teak from Brazil. Spaces, especially older ones, can also have quirks in them that need to be incorporated into the design of your shelving. “There can be a lot of bends and cuts that you have to fit the wood to,” said Scott. “That can consume a lot of time and add more to the cost.”</p>
<h3><strong>Paint costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting to the paint stage means you are close to the finish line. Your walls need to be prepared first, which might be your priciest point, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Another element that will affect your paint budget is if the color is flat, which is generally a better value than a semi-gloss. Also, the darker the color, the more coats of paint you will need, Bill said.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Real-world retail example</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To put things in perspective, here is an actual retail renovation budget for a New York beauty salon from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Paul</a>:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening a physical store is an exciting moment for a business. Whether it&#8217;s a simple build-out or one with more moving parts, there&#8217;s a path for you to bring your storefront into the spotlight.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03-600x400.jpg" alt="conference office table" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone wp-image-45503" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>(Above) A <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/an-nyc-office-renovation-to-expand-working-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new commercial office remodel with Sweeten</a> for an NYC-based tech brand</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps you have outgrown your home office or coworking space or maybe your business is in need of a fresh location or configuration. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office renovation</a> will give you a chance to dream long-term about where your business is heading and interpret that direction into blueprints for a space that will facilitate growth. In this guide, we&#8217;ll consider the many pieces of your office renovation cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An office renovation can be as simple as an improvement project that is negotiated between the landlord and the tenant before signing a lease. Often these are very basic renovations such as fresh paint and some new walls that the tenant ultimately pays for in the cost of the lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are after something more custom, there are, of course, many variables that will determine the cost per square foot. Is the location a new or old building? Was it previously an office? What part of the country will your office be in? What are your business needs? And what quality of work will match those needs?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new building with a basic build-out of carpet, paint, and lighting, including equipment such as a photocopier and coffee machine costs about $40 a square foot, according to <a href="https://42floors.com/us/nv/las-vegas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42Floors</a>, a national search engine listing real estate for office space. On the higher end of the scale, a build-out with finishes such as wood veneer doors and a stone reception desk could hit $100 to $150 a square foot. The office renovation cost could also increase if you are renovating in an older building where quirky spaces and issues, such as slanted floors, must be taken into account. Whatever your tastes and needs, here are budget line items to consider.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs to hire an architect for an office renovation </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people will choose to hire an architect or designer. Expect that to take 20 percent of your renovation budget, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Carla</a>. That could mean $40,000 of a $200,000 budget. Bringing in a design professional early on may save heartaches in the long run. Along with the overall look and feel of the project, architects can also take care of code issues, assess if the workspace size will be comfortable for the number of employees, ensure handicap accessibility, design custom work areas, and more. “You can express creativity and individuality,” said Carla.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office lighting and electrical costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While planning an office remodel, first consider who will be coming to your office, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3218">Anthony, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. If clients are making regular visits, “you don’t want it to look like you’re working out of a bomb shelter,” he said. Decent lighting is one of those elements you can use to impress your clients, an impression that will hopefully lead to more business. Basic lighting can cost about $250 a point (a light with a switch is considered two points), according to Anthony. For each 110 volt outlet, put $150 in your budget, and don’t forget things like lighting for emergency exit signs, which are about $300 each, according to the website <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Move Your Office</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for millwork and finishes in an office</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is another area where you can keep costs down while still wowing potential clients with your new office space. “I’ve done work in lawyer&#8217;s offices where inside it is a vanilla box with cubicles that the clients never see,” said Anthony. “Then you have a lobby and conference room that is decked out with custom woodwork and imported marble.” One sample office budget at Buildings.com put the cost of millwork and finishes at about $25 a square foot. The total office renovation cost for that build-out came to $90 a square foot.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWIyD5_VuQ8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40888 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs to build walls</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similar to lighting and millwork, walls can differ greatly in cost. A basic partition wall that is ten linear square feet could cost around $60. Glass walls are not often priced per square foot and are instead sold as a package. However, using executive design elements such as glass walls could push the entire cost of your office renovation towards the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/64oqcghu49v4txd/Kirksey_ConstructionCostUpdate_2015_0.pdf?dl=0%20Paint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$150 </a>a square foot range.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office flooring costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commercial-grade carpet or a vinyl tile can cost <a href="https://naiglobal.com//journal_item_attachments/000/551/662/original/construction_costs.pdf?1421682262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as little</a> as $4 a square foot to supply and install. Wood plank floors can <a href="https://www.remodelingexpense.com/costs/cost-of-plank-flooring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost</a> around $7 a square foot for a 5,000-square-foot office. If there will be an industrial theme in your new office, then concrete flooring might be an economical option starting at $2 a square foot, according to the <a href="https://www.concretenetwork.com/concrete/interiorfloors/cost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concrete Network</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office bathroom costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many office buildings will have a communal bathroom area on each floor for tenants. If there is no bathroom, you must install at least one. <a href="https://americanrestroom.org/the-united-states-code-of-federal-regulations-for-toilet-facilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US code</a> requires one bathroom per one to 15 staff members. That climbs to six bathrooms for 111 to 150 staff.  A single restroom could cost a little under $15,000, according to <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Move Your Office</a>. If your staff likes to shower at work after jogging or riding into the office, a shower (make sure it is handicap friendly as per the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>), will cost just shy of $6,000.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace14-600x388.jpg" alt="" width="725" height="468" class="alignnone wp-image-30090" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace14-600x388.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace14-300x194.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace14.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /><em>(Above) The office kitchen and go-to snacking area from <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/dominos-new-office-is-so-domino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domino&#8217;s NYC office renovation with Sweeten</a></em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office kitchen costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An office kitchen can help team members feel appreciated. In the office renovation cost outline at the end of this article, Sweeten contractor Anthony installed an office bathroom and kitchenette. The total budget for those two items was around $16,000. The kitchenette, which consisted of a sink and fridge, took about 25 percent or $4,000 of that budget. Because the kitchenette and the bathroom were near each other, the project made double use of the plumbing to reduce overall costs. “It really depends on how much plumbing and millwork you need,” said Anthony. “You could have a simple cabinet or a whole countertop with a microwave, fridge, and sink.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fire protection</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on the building you are leasing, this could (hopefully) already be in place. If there is a sprinkler system, it is well worth spending a few hundred dollars to have an engineer inspect it to ensure it works and that it is up to current code. Installing a system from scratch in a small to a medium-sized office could set you back between $5,000 to $10,000, according to Anthony. He estimates that a sprinkler system will cost about $200 per sprinkler head, plus an additional $2,000 to have a plan drawn up as well as permits and inspections.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HVAC for offices</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping an office well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature can have a big impact on employee productivity. So, installing an HVAC—heating ventilation and air conditioning system—might be worth it if there isn’t already one in your new location. An HVAC system could cost between $15 to almost $30 a square foot or 15 to 20 percent of your entire office renovation cost, according to the Builder’s Association.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Labor costs for an office remodel </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a typical office renovation, labor should take about <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ten percent</a> of your entire budget. However, consider the geographic differences in labor costs. For example, the cost of labor in New York City is 70 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/costs/kitchen-remodeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr</a>. Philadelphia is 40 percent and Dallas ten percent above the national average. Charleston, South Carolina, and Scottsdale, Arizona, are both one percent below the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certain factors in individual cities can add another variable. For example, in New York City, there are union and non-union buildings. For union buildings, tenants are required to use union labor, which can almost double the office renovation cost of a project, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. The basic build-out of an office in a non-labor building can be as little as $40 a square foot or as much as $100 a square foot in a labor building, according to <a href="https://42floors.com/edu/space-buildout/gauging-the-cost-of-an-office-build-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42Floors</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, a real budget for a 5,500 square-foot office renovation in NYC from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Paul</a>:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurant renovation costs are hardly a prix fixe situation; they can vary dramatically based on the project. Is it a turnkey situation, where you’re planning to open up in a former restaurant location that already has a kitchen, gas, and electrical? Or are you starting from scratch? The city you’re in will also impact the cost, as will the quality of the finishes and the other professionals you hire for your team. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractor, offers some categories to account for and tips on how to draw up an initial budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.buildingjournal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building Journal</a> puts the national average cost for a 5,000-square-foot restaurant with mid-level finishes at $160 a square foot, or $480,000. This can include the build-out, permits, equipment, and design. That cost is higher if you’re based in an expensive city such as New York ($216 per square foot) or Philadelphia ($180 per square foot). &#8220;We tell chefs in NYC who are typically looking at a 2,000-2,500 sq/ft space for a 50-80 seat restaurant that costs can range from $300-350 per square foot for the front of house and $200 per square foot for the back of house,&#8221; says Jonathan Garnett, the creative director at architectural firm MNDPC. &#8220;Multiply that by the 2,000-square-foot space and you have a ballpark.&#8221; Note that this scope does not include furniture, fixtures or restaurant equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What your food and beverage establishment will cost is unclear until you sit down to develop a budget. Here are elements to seriously consider when pulling together an initial budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46400" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png" alt="find general contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Design for a Restaurant Renovation</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For some, starting a restaurant is a creative endeavor, so they prefer to work closely with their general contractor, architect or designer on the design. Some smaller projects like a cafe might not warrant hiring a restaurant designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s a huge range: Those looking to bring in a designer could pay as little as $25,000 or as much as $400,000 and beyond, according to Jimmy Haber, from <a href="https://e2hospitality.com/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESquared Hospitality</a>, which has a long list of successful restaurant ventures all over the world. <span class="s1">The cost depends on the “celebrity” quotient of the designer, whether the space requires a lot of alterations in order to implement a certain design, or </span><span class="s1">how elaborate the decor will be. </span>A restaurant designer won’t just help with the look and feel of the place, but also the all-important layout. The layout will greatly impact the flow of service from kitchen to patron and your staff’s ability to do their job during busy moments. Bringing in an architect early on in the process will provide cost-effective expertise from start to finish, saving time and headache. Basic services include drawing up schematics and submitting the Certificate of Occupancy, but a full-service architect can provide guidance from project management to various levels of interior design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A designer&#8217;s expertise could also increase the number of seats in the establishment, increasing income in the long run. “By the time you construct and open your restaurant, the mistakes are already there and it is too late,” said Jimmy, on why a designer is worth considering. If you’re big on the creative aspect, then make sure you select a designer who you feel will work within your vision rather than commandeer it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Review the MEPs: mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is critical to do before even renting or buying a space (if you’re at this stage, read our earlier <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>). Perhaps the MEPs are so far gone you will opt for a different venue altogether. Regardless, accessing the MEPs will help you set a realistic budget. For example, a decrepit HVAC system can blow the budget out by tens of thousands of dollars, according to Dan Soloway, a hospitality consultant with Kitchen Options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In big bureaucratic cities like New York, connecting the gas can take months, which is why Jimmy no longer uses gas appliances in his establishment. He only uses electric to save clients from costly delays of connecting gas.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Permits for a Restaurant Renovation</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fitting out a new restaurant or renovating an existing one will rope in a lot of government departments—the fire department, the gas provider, buildings department, etc.—from whatever town or city you’re in. The actual permits can be a low-cost item on a budget (Jimmy estimates less than $5,000), but getting those approved can add substantially to the overall restaurant renovation cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before you sign a lease, always check the <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certificate of occupancy</a> (CO). This will dictate what the space can be used for. If it doesn’t give permission for a food and beverage establishment, changing it could be expensive and time-consuming, or in some cases, impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve checked the CO, Jimmy recommends spending the $25,000 or so to bring in a mechanical engineer, a kitchen consultant, and a lawyer. That team can look over everything from the liquor license (if the location has one, which is ideal) to the MEPs that we mentioned above. If these areas are not up to par, that could delay the approval of your permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What if your location isn&#8217;t already approved for a liquor license? It has become increasingly common for clauses to allow restaurateurs to exit the lease if a liquor license application is denied, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. “That’s because the business might hinge on your ability to sell alcohol,” he said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>General construction</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Floors might still need to be laid and bathrooms built or renovated. A survey of more than 700 responses from the industry publication <a href="https://www.restaurantowner.com/public/Survey-How-Much-Does-it-Cost-to-Open-a-Restaurant.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Restaurant Owner</a> found for a medium restaurant—around 3,200 square feet—construction alone or build-out cost an average $50 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if it is a turnkey restaurant, things like accessibility must be up to current standards, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slavica, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjJnJjIEXOM&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40884 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Equipment</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The restaurant renovation cost of fitting out a bar and kitchen, including all the equipment like burners and espresso machines, can be a big budget line item. The Restaurant Owner’s survey put the average cost of a 1,000-square-foot bar and kitchen, including the equipment, at about $75,000, or $80 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurateurs can buy second-hand equipment, but first, they must do their due diligence. That usually involves spending a few hundred dollars for a technician to look over the equipment before buying it, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. There is also the option to lease equipment, which means a reduced upfront payment, but possibly more in the long run. However, the leasing company normally handles repairs and might even provide things like detergent with a dishwasher.</p>
<h3><b>Rent and labor contingency</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, things can go wrong in a renovation. On average, the Restaurant Owner’s survey found that the overrun on a restaurant remodel budget to be 34 percent. Numerous hurdles can slow down your opening and delay that exciting moment when you make your first sale. Meanwhile, you&#8217;re still paying rent for the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I think your pre-opening rent can be a big wild card. It usually takes much longer to open than you think it does,” said Jimmy, from ESquared Hospitality. A six-month rent contingency can be a business-saver, as is a few months&#8217; contingency for staff costs. Sometimes staff members are already hired—manager, chef, sommelier, etc.—and on the payroll when a delay arises. A labor contingency means you can continue paying them during the delay. Otherwise, they could look for new jobs, which means starting the hiring process from scratch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assessing and writing a restaurant renovation cost plan is like charting a new land—confusing, tedious, and with a few questions marks. However, having a realistic budget can set you up for success while bringing you one step closer to your dream business. Here is a budget breakdown for a 2,000-<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">square-foot</span> <span style="color: #000000;">restaurant in</span> <span style="color: #000000;">New York City by</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Tony</a><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25960 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/budget-723x723.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="723" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Building on the success of their first counter-serve restaurant in Chinatown, the founders of Chikarashi develop their hold on a modern interpretation of poke (pronounced poh-</em>keh<em>), a traditional Polynesian dish, with a second location in NoMad. They called on Sweeten to execute the design for the new space, influenced by Japanese minimalism with all-wood paneling and counter seating. The brand is garnering raves (Eater praised their &#8220;chef-driven poke,&#8221;) and is also working with Sweeten on a third location—their flagship—in the Financial District. </em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Tell us a little bit about Chikarashi and how the brand began.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chef Michael:</strong> The brand began with an idea from Ivy and Selwyn wanting to bring a Polynesian restaurant to Chinatown. They had some ideas considering the food culture and popularity that were going on in the market when I was brought into the project. I thought about the ingredients that are common and used my Japanese training to add to chirashi (a big bowl of rice mixed with fish and vegetables) and to an overall poke concept.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the opening of your brick-and-mortar store?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Selwyn:</strong> For our initial location, we were looking to do a nice concept in the Chinatown neighborhood that was not Chinese food. We had always been enamored with Japanese cuisine and saw the bubbling trend of the poke coming up. We liked the concept, but didn’t like any of the execution that was going around, so we partnered with Chef Mike to create our own take on it. The brick-and-mortar space was obviously something that we needed. We had come across a small space that was available and knew this concept wouldn&#8217;t require a full, traditional kitchen build, but could be done quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> How does your new restaurant space represent your brand?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ivy:</b> We serve Japanese chirashi and poke-inspired bowls, so in terms of the design, we would naturally lean towards Japanese minimalism. We took design cues from smaller shops in Japan and brought them into our space here. In both the Canal Street and this new location, we brought in a lot of earth tones with the walls paneled in maple wood. You get a similar sense if you were to walk into a ramen shop or a sushi restaurant in Japan, or Kyoto. We decided to not have a large space, but that something roughly 700 square feet was a nice size to work with. It’s a little bit more cozy and mainly for people to come in to take their bowls to go or to sit down. We have eight seats.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> How did you, as a client, work with Sweeten and how do you think Sweeten can help business owners like yourself?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Selwyn:</b> Sweeten has been really wonderful because it’s almost a one-stop shop, if you will. They offer a lot of guidance and the vetting of their partners is pretty extensive. We felt really comfortable when it came time to select a general contractor to work on the project itself, that the company would fulfill the needs of the build but also would fit well from a chemistry standpoint. I think Sweeten handles that matching process wonderfully.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Selwyn:</b> Yeah, absolutely. Sweeten was always there to kind of help navigate at every step of the process. Any questions were always answered in a quick fashion and they really offered their years of expertise to make the entire process a smooth renovation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting a business is both daunting and exciting. It could mean that you will finally be your own boss, or have a chance to execute on an idea that has beckoned you for years. But that good idea and that excitement do not pay the bills. It will take some meticulous planning to get through a business renovation and end up with an enterprise that not only feeds your soul but pushes your business into the black.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">About 80 percent of small businesses fail in their first year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. One of the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/small-business-central/2017/05/21/what-percentage-of-businesses-fail-in-their-first-year/101260716/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest reasons</a>? They get to the end of their budget by either not making a profit or underestimating the amount of time and capital they will need before crossing over into a profitable business. At <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, we want to see every business succeed. It’s one of the reasons why we offer a free service connecting business owners with fully vetted general contractors when it&#8217;s time to start or expand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are a few ways to make sure you don&#8217;t burn through your business&#8217;s renovation budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-40003 size-full aligncenter" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/HowSweetenWorks.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="50" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Minimize change orders with precise planning</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jimmy Haber knows a thing or two about successfully surviving a business renovation. His company, <a href="https://e2hospitality.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esquared</a>, has a long list of successful restaurants, including the popular vegan dining chain <a href="https://eatbychloe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by CHLOE</a>. For Jimmy, the biggest disrupter to a budget is change orders. These can occur once the scope of work and budget are agreed upon by business owner and contractor, serving up an unexpected addition to the cost and complexity of a project. “A change order can happen for a thousand different reasons,” he said. “It could be as simple as ‘that outlet doesn’t belong there. It is better if it is here.’” Or more complicated such as needing to redo a design feature that doesn’t quite look right or drawing up a budget from a preliminary set of plans rather than a final set.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“You have to go through and meticulously plan everything out,” said Jimmy. Not only will the change order likely add to your budget, since you’re already in agreement with your contractor, it is more difficult to get a competitive price on that additional scope of work. “Because they already have the job, you no longer have any leverage, but they do,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Contingency for staff costs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having a delay in a construction project once new staff already has a start date will put any business owner in a dilemma. If you let those staff members go, then you&#8217;ll have to go through the time-consuming process of re-hiring replacements once you are ready to open. Or, if you want to secure the team you&#8217;ve hired, keeping them on the payroll might be the only way to stop them from going elsewhere. “This can be the most painful and difficult stage that can crush your budget,” said Jimmy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One solution is to be prepared with a contingency line item in the budget for staff costs in the case that construction is delayed and you’ve already hired your staff. Other times it might mean holding on to key staff, like executive chef for a restaurant or a general manager for a retail space, while letting go of those in high turnover positions such as servers.</p>

<p><strong>Keep a line of credit handy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just like a lifebuoy in a pool area, a line of credit should be ready to go if your project needs additional cash to stay afloat, said Andrew Flamm. He is the director of the <a href="https://www.pacesbdc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pace University Small Business Development Center,</a> which connects small business owners with funding as well as support and mentorship. A line of credit is different from a typical term loan. With a term loan, once you are approved you receive it in a lump sum and begin paying interest on it immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A line of credit requires approval; however, it remains in the lender&#8217;s possession. You only access it if and when you need to. You also only begin paying interest on the loan once you start using it and you don’t need to draw on the entire amount available to you. Only take what you need. “Then you are not scrambling to pay a bill or overextending on your credit card,” said Andrew. “That could have implications on your credit score and affect future funding down the road.” Lines of credit usually have a slightly higher interest rate than a term loan, but it could save your business and your personal credit score if you get into a bind.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare to pay operating costs early</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One area that trips up many new businesses is forgetting operating costs while a renovation is in progress, according to Alek Marfisi, a small business consultant with <a href="https://upwindstrategies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upwind Strategies</a>. If you’re building out a space, you will still need to pay utility bills like gas and electricity, internet connection, business liability insurance, and property insurance. Having plenty of temporary working capital on hand is a must for these situations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40462 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Dan-Nelken-UnionSq-Lobby-19.jpg" alt="lobby" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Dan-Nelken-UnionSq-Lobby-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Dan-Nelken-UnionSq-Lobby-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Dan-Nelken-UnionSq-Lobby-19-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Dan-Nelken-UnionSq-Lobby-19-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/union-square-lobby-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A residential lobby renovation</a> in Union Square by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Tim</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Temporary working capital</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition to the contingency funds you need to have to pay for overruns in the cost of construction, you should have enough temporary working capital <span class="s1">to cover at least two months of operating expenses should the construction project take longer than planned. This is p</span></span>art of your entire budget for working capital, and is what helps you handle any unexpected costs compared to permanent working capital, which is what you typically need to run your business. “It will get you through the losses from starting or expanding your business and while you’re not making any money,” said Alek. Temporary working capital covers the construction period and the period of time <span class="s1">in which the business is losing money before it breaks even.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with so many other expenses, these operating costs will need to be paid regardless of whether your renovation project runs on schedule or gets delayed. That’s why these costs should also be factored into a contingency plan in case your opening date gets bumped back.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Managing a successful renovation in your business comes down to detailed planning. Plus, it’s never a bad thing to be overly generous with your contingency line item in your budget so you are ready if something goes wrong. And if it all goes to plan, then there&#8217;s more capital to invest back into your dream business.</p>
