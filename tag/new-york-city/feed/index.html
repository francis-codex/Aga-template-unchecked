										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What can homeowners do when they need more space at home—but don&#8217;t want to leave?</h2>
<p>Many homeowners find themselves in a tough spot when their home&#8217;s space, design, or location stops working for them. Many wind up asking themselves: should I move, or remodel?  A <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/americans-prefer-renovations-21576/">Zillow study</a> found that when given a choice between spending a fixed budget on a down payment or using the same amount to remodel, 76 percent would opt to renovate.</p>
<p>Between leaving their neighborhoods and staying put, these homeowners ultimately made the choice to reimagine their homes with Sweeten&#8217;s help. <span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>A big refresh for a beloved loft</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leah and Brian loved the Logan Square <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loft they had been calling home</a> for several years. The Chicago neighborhood’s energy and the industrial brick warehouse added to the lifestyle they were enjoying. But with time the wear-and-tear takes a toll on materials and daily functioning. They decided to renovate and stay in the area. The couple posted their project on Sweeten to update the entire space including a new kitchen and floors. Without structural changes, Leah and Brian brought out the best of their 14-foot ceilings.</span></p>

<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="white-island-separator-blue-cabinets"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48144 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After.jpg" alt="white island separator in a kitchen with blue cabinets and white countertop space along with blue wallpaper and open white shelves" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>When you can&#8217;t go bigger, get creative</h3>
<p>Surging prices in her Fort Greene co-op building made upgrading from a studio to a true one-bedroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">out of the question for Mollie</a>. She had to decide to either move elsewhere to get more space or remodel her cozy studio. Luckily, Mollie realized the market value of her apartment (and that she could borrow against her equity)! She came to Sweeten, was matched with a general contractor, and reconfigured the 500-square-foot apartment to suit her playful style.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="light-brick-wall-narrow-living-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48148 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4.jpg" alt="light brick wall in a narrow living room with plush gray and blue furniture and open metal shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Baby on the way? Make your square footage go further</h3>
<p>A two-bedroom apartment was perfect for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-duplex-renovated-for-a-new-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel and Marco</a>—until they decided to expand their family. Fortunately, their duplex had enough square footage for them to get creative with! This made it possible to remodel and rethink how they used the layout, instead of moving. They turned the top floor into a combined kitchen and living area, while they divided the rest of the space into an office, closet, and bedrooms.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-gray-cabinets"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48147 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg" alt="white kitchen with gray kitchen cabinets under white countertop and farmhouse style sink after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Give a well-loved home some TLC upgrades</h3>
<p>After a year-long search for a new apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/renovating-to-stay-in-a-beloved-neighborhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Igor</a> decided their sons’ schools, proximity to work, and an overall adoration for their lifestyle in Carroll Gardens were reason enough to stay in their apartment. They worked with a Sweeten general contractor to overhaul their dark kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom. The result? Open and modern spaces fit for the family of four.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-barn-door-large-living-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48146 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg" alt="white barn door in a large living room with large windows and natural wood flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Combine two apartments into one home, sweet home</h3>
<p>A desire for more room led to multiple (unsuccessful) apartment searches for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoe and Arvid</a>. Her dream of renovating and combining apartments finally put the hunt to an end. After contacting neighbors and finding one who was looking to move, their plan was underway. The additional square footage allowed for a third bedroom, a much larger kitchen, and an expanded living area.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="large-gray-living-room-vinyl-floor"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48145 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg" alt="large gray and white living room with large windows and brown vinyl floor after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting &#8220;upstate&#8221; light and space—with a city zip code</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney and Jim’s</a> Clinton Hill Co-op apartment lacked storage and light, which sent them on a search for a second home upstate. When they made an offer on the second property, reality hit: they needed to make their main residence work for them before taking on a new place. The couple decided to remodel, opening up the kitchen the rest of the living areas and reconfiguring storage closets to suit the family of four’s storage needs.</p>

</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you and your client come together?</p>
<p><strong>Piper:</strong> Packet sought an interior design agency to align its growing office space in Lower Manhattan with its dynamic, emerging brand. Packet’s co-founder and CMO, Jacob Smith, reached out to another one of our tech clients (White Ops, who is also a customer of Packet) for a referral, and after noting our work there, gave us a call.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What is the client’s brand?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>Packet creates the high-touch aspect of high-tech — making cloud infrastructure more delightful to consume for the top digital businesses in the world. Clients, partners, and employees needed to experience the brand the moment they entered the office and throughout their journey in the space.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the opening of this new office space?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>The tech company, which was founded in 2014, had recently doubled its staff and was planning on another year of team growth. While the company is about 70% remote, NYC is its headquarters and one of its global “hubs” where the team gathers regularly. When another floor in the building they occupy became available, Packet <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/office-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">immediately grabbed it</a>.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do your new design and the materials used to represent your brand?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>The brand colors dictated our palette but it was important for us as designers to go beyond an easy and obvious link. It was essential to convey their brand experience throughout the space.</p>
<p>When selecting materials for their Manhattan office renovation, the sense of tangible authenticity—a certain “human-ness”—guided our choices. We opted for wood floors with character, felt walls, linoleum work surfaces, and a special dyed-through MDF that you leave exposed (as opposed to painting.) In addition to tactile fabrics, patterns that reference those seen in their cloud data centers further connected the space to the physical aspects of the product and brand.</p>
<p>In terms of space planning, Chapter Interiors strived for activity-based workplace design. Instead of asking the person to adjust to the space; we investigate how clients work and build spaces to suit. This results in an array of environments for employees—spaces that facilitate certain aspects of work and help optimize performance. An example was helping Packet design for different types of work (e.g. talk-heavy sales vs headphones-on engineering) while finding places for people to gather, recharge, exchange ideas, or be active.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45553 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-13-1.gif" alt="office phone booth" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) A phone booth for calls and video meetings</span></p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> With companies working remotely because of COVID-19, do you foresee companies downsizing their commercial workspaces? How will office spaces change and service in the post-COVID world?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>Yes! Reducing your footprint is an excellent opportunity to redesign your space (and save money.) In the short term post-COVID world, barriers will be erected and procedures will be put in place to minimize germ transmission. The longer-term implications are rethinking why people should go to the office.</p>
<p>Companies still need space for employees to gather. Moving forward, I see workplaces geared towards collaboration, team building, and brand connectivity with consumers and partners. Dedicated desks and independent work while at the office is less and less important. Numerous studies during the pandemic have proven that working from home does not hinder overall productivity.</p>
<p>It makes sense to combine working from home with time at the office. The best analogy I’ve heard so far is that working from home versus going into the office will be similar to eating at home versus going out to a restaurant. Employers need to make coming into the office special by providing spaces that foster activities that are worth traveling for. This ties into our strong belief in activity-based-workplace-design.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How was your vision executed by working with your Sweeten general contractor?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>The site manager was wonderful. From day one it was clear she cared about the quality of work and was very hands-on. Together, we worked to problem-solve several issues to make sure the <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-renovation-costs-pacing-your-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">final product was cost-effective</a>, durable, and displayed craftsmanship. I would love to work with her again!</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you, as a client, work with Sweeten?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>We work with contractors all the time— yet still, find the process of finding the right contractor daunting. For Packet&#8217;s office renovation in Manhattan, I had very targeted needs, and Sweeten helped me quickly vet and compare contractors.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Can you describe the “before” space?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>Words can&#8217;t describe this space before! It was raw, with filthy carpet and random paint patches throughout. Bad shape… But the potential that Packet saw was great, with pervasive natural light, airy ceiling height, and breathtaking views.</p>

<h2 dir="auto">Original or newly hewn, exposed beams boast some serious style</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s true their original purpose was solely functional, exposed beams have proven their worth beyond utility time and time again. Whether your home has an industrial, rustic, or contemporary feel, they up the drama and demand attention. These renovators, who all worked with </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, proved just how striking exposed beams really are, regardless if they’re original to a home or newly added. </span></p>
<h3><strong>A Tudor home returns to its roots with exposed beams</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41026" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sara and Mike gave their Tudor home a modern layout when they had their contractor knock down walls and create an open concept kitchen and dining space. To bring back more of the home’s Tudor characteristics (and to provide structural support) their contractor brought in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/1930s-westchester-tudor-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exposed beams that echo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the rest of the woodwork.</span></p>
<h3>1929 exposed beams preserve Parisian-chic style</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40408" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20.jpg" alt="living area" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s further proof that exposed beams can work for </span> any home style<span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Liya and her family’s Parisian-chic home, the contractor left the original 1929 beams intact. The white walls, ceilings, and beams create a crisp and clean look that contrasts with the dark wood floors and charcoal furnishings.</span></p>
<h3>An industrial, clean take on beams</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-20051 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20051 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="exposed beams, home renovation, design, construction, open living" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A renovation surprise may not always be a good thing, but in the case of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lia and Chris’ </a>Williamsburg loft remodel, it most certainly was. Their top-floor unit with a terrace, parking space, and sky-high ceilings offered another benefit: original beams. Much to the couple’s delight, their contractor proposed they open up the walls and ceiling encasing building beams in the kitchen and living room. “This eliminated awkward lines and revealed some industrial elements,” Lia said.</p>
<h3>Once hidden behind walls, beams become new focal point</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-24689 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24689 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="exposed beams, home renovation, design, construction, open living" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meg and Brett’s</a> carriage home in Hamilton Heights was already chockful of historical charm, and once they exposed the original beams, it went to the next level. How they found the beams is a story in itself: “We walked around and knocked on the drywall—if it felt hollow, we put a hole through to see what was underneath,” Brett said. They came across different sets: wooden ones original to the carriage house, and iron beams installed to support the structure. “Some of the beams had initials in them, and we even found a horsehair or two caught in the wood,” he added.</p>
<h3>Exposed beams add character (and even out ceilings!)</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-21828 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21828 mb-0 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1.jpg" alt="exposed beams, home renovation, design, construction, open living" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You know how the saying goes, if you don’t have it, add it. Jessica and David’s 875-square-foot apartment in Hudson Heights saw a lot of updates to make it work for their family. One stylistic addition they requested? Exposed beams. They wanted to bring more character to the space and as it turned out, the update served a dual purpose: the beams placed on the ceiling helped conceal an unfortunate spot where the ceiling was higher.</p>
<h3><strong>Recessed lighting within beams adds light, separation</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-32367 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32367 size-full" title="gray-living-space-recessed-lights" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02.jpg" alt="gray living space with recessed lights on ceiling and couch along with white round breakfast table and chairs after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>First-time renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/with-this-reno-i-thee-wed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather and Eric</a> took on a dark co-op apartment renovation in Manhattan with the intention to lighten and open up the barren space. To turn the blank canvas into a home with more interesting detail, plus tackle a need for overhead lighting, they added non-support beams in the living room and bedroom. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The structures offered a stylish and unique lighting solution that felt inherent to the home. </span></p>
<h3>Cobble Hill home goes to new heights after finding hidden beams</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-26642 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26642 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="exposed beams, home renovation, design, construction, open living" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
It’s amazing what can be unveiled in a renovation. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miguel</a> set to renovate his “bland, cookie-cutter, white box” of an apartment in Cobble Hill and to his total surprise, learned it wasn’t so ordinary. The contractor was fixing some electrical issues and came across a brick wall, and then a ceiling of beautiful beams! Since the ceilings weren’t very high, Miguel decided to paint them white to make the apartment feel bigger and brighter.</p>

<p><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction + architecture?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: I was born in Easton, Maryland. I grew up there and moved to Newark, Delaware when I was 10.  I’ve been in the field of architecture and design since 2004.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: Originally from Wilmington, Delaware. I have been involved in the construction industry in some form since 1986.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get into the industry?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: I started my career as an interior designer, but always worked for architects in a role that more closely resembled an interior architect rather than a designer or decorator. During the recession, I was lucky enough to retain my job but shifted studios within the large firm I was working for and made the decision to pursue my architectural license. Dave put up with me during a year of maniacal studying while working full time and taking those exams to get the license.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>:  I started life in finance. I worked for a large financial company for over 12 years. At the same time, I had a side life in construction. I soon learned that I enjoyed seeing things get built rather than just moving numbers around. I made a bold decision to change my life to do something that challenges me every day in a way that I can enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love most about what you do?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan and David</span>: Transforming old run-down spaces into beautiful places that people can enjoy with their families. We really enjoy going into different buildings throughout the city that we&#8217;ve never been in to get a different taste of the city.</p>
<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New York?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: Designing spaces that maximize the layout and function for our clients while still meeting the (sometimes seemingly ridiculous) NYC Building Code restrictions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: Constraints: limited timeframes, limited building hours, unhappy neighbors, logistics for material deliveries, logistics moving crew to projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32502 size-chrono" title="Renovation Checklist" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-723x143.jpg" alt="Renovation Checklist" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-723x143.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-600x119.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist.jpg 975w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>If clients have questions or concerns, how would you like them to address them?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan and David</span>: We highly value communication and feel it is the most important part of the process. We want clients to bring their questions or concerns to us as soon as possible so that we can address them as quickly as possible. We use web-based software to manage projects and clients can post their questions/comments with pictures and our team can address them, but email and phone calls also work. However, please don’t text us at 3:00am—we have lives and families too.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: We’re going to encounter hiccups. That’s nearly a given. You’re hiring our team to navigate those hiccups in the least painful way possible so that you can continue to enjoy your life while we deal with the challenges.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: As with many things in life, you often get what you pay for. We are not the least expensive option in the city, but if you want good quality work from a full-service team that will commit to your project and give you a great experience, we’re worth every penny.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City building? </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: Oddly and not for architectural reasons, the Time Warner Center at Columbus.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: Grand Central Station.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City neighborhood?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: The West Village.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: The Financial District.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City restaurant?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan and David</span>: El Centro–before having a family, we used to go twice a week. Amazing margaritas and no-frills Mexican!</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What is Babeland and how did the brand begin?</p>
<p><strong>Sharon:</strong> Babeland was modeled after its sister company, Good Vibrations, a women-founded sex-positive adult toy company that opened in San Francisco in response to the lack of women-friendly sex shops. The first Babeland store was opened in 1993 in Seattle, offering a safe, welcoming, and non-judgmental environment where customers could shop for sex toys and books, as well as attend workshops and inspiring events. The store&#8217;s popularity led to three more locations in New York.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the remodeling of your retail space?</p>
<p><strong>Sharon:</strong> The SoHo location opened in 2003, and after 15 years, it was time to refresh the store to stay relevant within the community and to improve the shopping experience for our customers. In the past year, we had increased our product selection dramatically and needed ways to present these products. We also needed a more efficient plan for storing product so staff could easily merchandise and restock the shelves. This meant moving inventory up to the sales floor. We created a storage room in the back that took up more square footage, but because of the new fixture plan and flow, the store actually feels more spacious and allows for easier navigation from section to section.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">I felt completely confident with the process, even with being close to 3,000 miles away from the project.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How does your new retail design represent your brand?</p>
<p><strong>Sharon:</strong> We were able to create better ways to showcase our large product selection and still keep the store feeling welcoming, safe, and fun. We used sleek tables and cabinets that allow our products to shine and encourage customers to explore. Customers can see more products through printed posters, mannequins, or display units; the shopping experience is much more interesting.</p>
<p>Our entryway has selfie stations where customers can have a little fun. They break the ice for those who may never have been to a sex toy shop or are apprehensive to enter. They allow customers to relax and realize that this can be a fun place to shop.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How was your vision executed by working with your Sweeten general contractor?</p>
<p><strong>Sharon:</strong> Executing a remodel from across the country always poses potential problems. This remodel was scheduled to happen at our busiest time of year, so I was unable to get to New York to meet with contractors. Once our contractor was selected through Sweeten, I presented scaled drawings of the changes needed for this project, and through phone calls and emails, we were able to get the project underway. It was very helpful having an outstanding area manager, Amy Carnegie, on site to act as a liaison when necessary. Once I arrived in New York, the final stages of the renovation were completed.</p>

<p><strong>Sharon:</strong> It had been years since I last worked with a contractor in New York, so I needed a reliable resource to help find a contractor that could execute the work required within our budget. I presented the job requirements through Sweeten’s website and immediately received responses. They matched us with quite a few potential contractors. Once we accepted a bid from our chosen contractor, Sweeten stayed in touch with me on several occasions to check on progress, and offer assistance if needed. <span style="color: #000000;">I felt completely confident with the process, even with being close to 3,000 miles away from the project.</span></p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do you think Sweeten can help entrepreneurial companies like yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Sharon</strong>: The services Sweeten offer are fantastic. The contractors have been vetted by Sweeten and clients can correspond freely with the contractors through Sweeten’s email system and make choices based on their particular needs. All this is happening while knowing the Sweeten staff are keeping an eye on your project. Regardless of the scope or budget of your renovation or build-out, Sweeten has a deep pool of talented contractors/designers they can connect you with.</p>

			<h2>Combining two apartments is never easy. See how these families combined spaces.</h2>
<p>Combining two apartments into one home is one of the most time-consuming (and rewarding!) projects in the renovation world. The reason behind the decision varies, but the need is usually the same&#8230; more space. These renovators approached us looking to find vetted <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractors who could <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">merge apartment units</a> to fit their changing lifestyles. Learn more from these NYC apartment combination examples below.</p>

<h3>1. Building a peaceful city oasis</h3>
<p>When this homeowner’s search for a three-bedroom apartment ended in disappointment, he decided to go in another direction. He bought two apartments in an Upper West Side co-op building after consulting the building’s management and an architect, with <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-apartment-combination-with-a-view/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a plan to combine them</a>. Both units were located at the end of a hallway.</p>
<p>Working with his architect and the Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor</a> he hired, he decided to merge them together through their kitchens and replace them with an open kitchen. He also expanded the primary bedroom and bathroom, creating a mini spa with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk-in shower</a>.</p>
<p>A few bumps came up during the project; converting the bathtub into a walk-in shower required raising the floor underneath for the drain pipes in order to meet code and when trying to designate an entryway, they realized the configuration just wasn’t working. He ended up buying additional square footage from the hallway to create a more inviting one. Construction took a total of six months of work. The time, effort, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation costs</a> were well worth it. The homeowner said the apartment, “feels like living in a peaceful oasis above the city.”</p>

<h3>2. Up against a wall</h3>
<p>Zoe had long dreamt of buying and combining apartments, so when she and her husband Arvid felt they had officially <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outgrown their 700-square-foot one-bedroom</a> in Lincoln Square, Manhattan, they took matters into their own hands. After sending letters to neighbors, they learned one was looking to move, and the couple bought their apartment.</p>
<p>The goal was to remove the two existing kitchens and replace them with a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern cook space</a>, plus rip out floors, and create a third bedroom. They learned knocking down walls certainly doesn’t come without challenges. Their contractor came across an unmovable gas riser in a wall they had planned to take down to open up the dining area. Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor assessed the options</a> and had a solution: Make it part of the architecture by designing a partition (pictured above) and creating a dining nook. “Our contractor carefully installed the panel and adjusted the baseboard to make a seamless connection. This graphic panel is now a nice focal point that adds a lot of character,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36557 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg" alt="Combining two apartments gave this couple a spacious kitchen a room to grow their family in the city" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label">(Above) Megan and Zak&#8217;s apartment combination in Manhattan</span></p>
<h3>3. Building one modern, family home</h3>
<p>When Megan and Zak bought a one-bedroom apartment in Carnegie Hill, Manhattan, they hoped the space would work for them and maybe a baby down the line. A year after living in their space, not only did they <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/carnegie-hill-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">realize it needed to be renovated</a>, but also that the apartment really wasn’t big enough for another human (even a tiny one). Luck was on their side as an apartment next door was available.</p>
<p>Once they finalized the sale, the couple started planning to combine the two apartments into one modern, family home. The biggest changes in the overall floorplan included eliminating one kitchen and converting a living room into a primary bathroom. The rest of the renovation focused on <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating an open concept kitchen</a> and living area.</p>
<p>While they did run into a few issues (like discovering pipes in a wall that needed to be rerouted), overall their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation experience went smoothly</a>. “Keeping our eye on the end goal—creating a home we love for us and our baby—made it all worth it. There’s a story and memory behind every material and decision we made. We feel so lucky to live in a space we created for our family,” Megan shared.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Increase storage and counter space in a Queens, NY, kitchen</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Ed, a buyer for a retail department of a major New York City museum, purchased a sponsor apartment with his late wife, Kate, in Jackson Heights, Queens, nearly 16 years ago. (A sponsor unit is a unit or an apartment owned by the original owner or corporation responsible for turning a building from a rental into a co-op.) The kitchen was made up of cheap materials they knew someday they’d want to replace to fit their taste.</p>
<p>“We were pretty enamored by the bungalow/Arts and Crafts/Mission style, given that our building was built around the end of the ‘bungalow boom’ and the neighborhood shared a similar, working middle-class ethos,” Ed said. Otherwise, storage and the lack of counter space were a big issue for them. They came to Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32386" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a>, and were matched with a general contractor.</p>

They moved the fridge to another wall, but otherwise, the layout remained the same. A radiator on the west wall presented a minor design challenge; their contractor suggested working around it by leaving a space open beneath the countertop.</p>
<p>Most of the project went off without a hitch and any issues that popped up were solved quickly (or planned ahead for). When the contractor went to pick up the quartz slab for their counter, he discovered it had been damaged in the warehouse. To keep the renovation on schedule, he texted Ed photos of other, similar options he found. “What we picked actually ended up looking better,” Ed said.</p>
<p>The renovators hoped when they removed the vinyl flooring, the wood underneath would be in good enough shape to keep. It turned out the adhesive used to affix the subfloor ruined the fir floors. Their contractor had thought ahead though, and had a flooring supplier save oak planking just in case. Since they had such a great experience and their contractor handled every issue that popped up, Ed shared he didn’t feel the need to contact Sweeten’s Client Services.&#8221;It speaks very highly of Sweeten’s contractor assessments that nothing came up that need your intervention,” he pointed out.</p>

<h3>Lessons Ed learned post-renovation?</h3>
<p>1.) Have a cleaning crew lined up.<br />
2.) If you’re renovating your kitchen, make sure you have alternative places to have your meals in mind. 3.) Make sure your contractor has multiple suppliers he/she works with. Luckily, theirs did, but that might not always be the case.</p>

<p>While Kate and Ed worked on the plans for their kitchen together, she passed away before she could see it come to fruition. “The kitchen is almost entirely Kate’s conception,” Ed said. “It really feels like I’m living in her vision—it’s really comforting.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Elegant ways to use an apartment radiator cover to hide design eyesores</h2>
<p>Sometimes the little details of renovations fall by the wayside because there are so many design and construction decisions to make. That&#8217;s why it’s important to recognize seemingly minor updates that can have a big impact. For example, think about an apartment radiator cover. They’re not a building requirement, and they don&#8217;t influence a radiator&#8217;s efficiency. Still, this nice-to-have detail can instantly make any space look more polished and provide additional storage too.</p>
<p>Here are some ways <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> homeowners upped their radiator game. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>1. Sleek and modern</h3>
<p>The centerpiece of this Park Slope, Brooklyn renovation was <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/park-slope-kitchen-remodel-navy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the kitchen</a>. However, the Sweeten general contractor helped complete a few other projects in the apartment, including a handsome radiator cover in the bedroom. “My growing puppy decided the cover was her favorite place to sit and watch squirrels,” the homeowner shared. “My general contractor came back to install reinforcements so it could handle the weight of a full-grown dog.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37913 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-11-1.jpg" alt="These sleek and modern apartment radiator cover completely hide this design eyesore" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-11-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-11-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-11-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-11-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37912 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-10-1.jpg" alt="These apartment radiator covers blend in seamlessly with the white, modern room design" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-10-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-10-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-10-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-10-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>2. Bookshelf camouflage</h3>
<p>Lauren’s renovation involved updating her apartment&#8217;s layout so the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen and living areas were open and cohesive</a>. She focused on built-in storage in the kitchen and wanted to bring the same element to her living space. “A sleek bookshelf hides my radiator and air conditioner units that were always annoyingly off-centered from the windows,” she said. Plus, the radiator cover is perfect for displaying plants and knick-knacks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31170 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg" alt="This homeowner used a bookshelf to strategically hide her two apartment radiators" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<hr />
<h3>3. Repurposed design elements</h3>
<p>Architects Terri and Brett<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/when-pros-design-their-family-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> gutted their Prospect Heights co-op</a> to make it feel more bright and spacious. Every detail was a result of their collaboration, including radiator covers in the living area and bedroom. A millworker made the radiators easier to access for maintenances purposes. Plus, the new covers&#8217; tops were made from leftover stone slabs from the kitchen. This helped create a cohesive design throughout the whole house.</p>

<h3>4. Custom carpentry</h3>
<p>While Charon’s<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/gramercy-park-bathroom-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> gorgeous green bathroom renovation</a> was in progress, her Sweeten general contractor’s carpentry team took care of other apartment details. They built a custom bedroom radiator cover to match one she already had in the living area. The new cover joined the design elements of her home and put the finishing touch on her already pretty sleep space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="gray-bedroom-double-bed" class="alignnone wp-image-37915 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-06-1.jpg" alt="gray bedroom with double bed and side table and window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-06-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-06-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37914 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-07-1.jpg" alt="The radiator becomes less of an eye sore and blends in with the rest of the room's design" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-07-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-07-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-07-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>4. Added storage</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Combining two apartments is no easy job</a>. Luckily, Zoe and Arvid easily overcame that challenge. Plus, they made sure to still take notice of small (and important) details in their new home. The air conditioning unit and radiator in their living had 50 years of layered paint. Not to mention, it took up valuable space. With their general contractor&#8217;s help, they designed an apartment radiator cover that made the appliance less obtrusive and added shelves for extra storage.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Refresh an old and outdated bathroom</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Penny, a product manager for a financial firm, and Kevin, a puppeteer with the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre, and their son, have lived in their over 100-year-old-plus co-op building for five years. They’ve been remodeling the Sunset Park, Brooklyn, apartment room by room, and until recently, waited on any major changes to the bathroom. They did, however, replace an old and “hideous” shower door with a curtain for a short-term fix. Once they were ready to bring the dingy space up to speed with their clean, simple style, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor.</a><strong><br />

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: While they stuck to the original footprint, Penny and Kevin made one big change that had a big impact on the overall look of the bathroom: replacing the bathtub for a walk-in shower. “We spent most of our budget converting the old tub,” Penny shared. They were especially excited about the brand new glass door. A big priority for the couple was sourcing materials locally. When they went to select their wood-like porcelain tile floor at a nearby supplier, they found the light blue and white tiles from the same store. The hardware and major fixtures also come from a Brooklyn showroom close to their home.</p>

The only issue that came up during the renovation was a leak from an apartment upstairs. It was resolved, as the neighbor became more vigilant about making sure water didn’t escape from outside her shower curtain, though if it leaks again, the issue will have to be readdressed.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the biggest challenge was the division of labor between Penny, Kevin, and their contractor—especially since the family was out of town for the majority of the project. The couple divided responsibilities, with Penny taking on the budget and Kevin handling the aesthetic aspects. “He presented me with beautiful designs and then I approved or suggested how we could do things on a budget,” Penny said.</p>
<p>They coordinated with their general contractor mostly via email and phone calls. “His willingness to work with a neighbor, send emails, and call was really helpful,” Penny said. As an experienced renovator, she’s learned to be more trusting of a contractor’s advice, but also that it’s important to speak up about what you’re looking to achieve.  “Be clear on what you want, don’t give up on your design, but be flexible and listen to your contractor. You will be surprised on how that can help—they see a lot.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Penny also added these words of wisdom: “Go with the contractor that listens and seems pleasant to work with,” she said.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Renovating former rental properties to become sources of comfort, instead of income</h2>
<p>No matter how well you take care of a home, things can be damaged accidentally or worn down over time. This is especially true when renovating former rental properties. Especially when tenants move in and out year after year.</p>
<p>Sometimes, homeowners need a break from the stress of renting a property. And sometimes, they&#8217;re ready to hang up their hats as landlords and update their former leasing properties to live in themselves. To take care of the wear and tear and to suit their needs and style, these homeowners turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors. Here are four renovation projects aimed at renovating former rental properties into forever homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35590 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-723x482.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, bathroom renovation, vanity, walnut, open storage, round mirror, convert a rental into a primary residence" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>1.) Outdated Rental Property to Modern Apartment</h3>
<p>Sherry’s family purchased a Midtown East apartment in 2008. While they originally bought it as a rental property, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/millennial-apartment-renovation-midtown-east/">Sherry decided to move in</a> just ten years later. However, it hadn’t been renovated since the ‘80s and had extensive water damage from a previous tenant. Still, the apartment had good bones (and space!). Her remodel involved replacing the flooring in every room. She also completely updated the kitchen and bathrooms to reflect her modern style.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21360 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="convert a rental into primary residence, kitchen, black and white" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>2. Prewar Studio to Charming Apartment</h3>
<p>New York City’s housing market is full of prewar apartments with elaborate features. When Emily moved to the city, she was in search of just that: <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a charming apartment with original details</a>. Her six-month search ended with the purchase of a 1940s studio apartment.</p>
<p>The apartment had long been used as a rental property—and didn&#8217;t reflect its historical roots. She worked with her Sweeten general contractor to restore the apartment to its former glory. They installed beautiful crown molding and paneling throughout.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30008 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="convert a rental into primary residence, bathroom" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>3.) Former Rental Property turned Uptown Retreat</h3>
<p>Ying and her parents’ Upper East Side apartment had seen many lives. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-rental-studio-becomes-a-pied-a-terre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Originally purchased as an investment</a>, the owners and renters had lived in the apartment off and on. After the family hit their co-op’s rental limit, they decided to reimagine the space as a second home. The family added new flooring, paint, lighting, custom built-ins, and an overhauled bathroom.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30242 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-723x482.jpg" alt="convert a rental into primary residence" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>4.) Updated Urban Residence</h3>
<p>After renting out their Manhattan property for over a decade, JoAnn and Brian were ready to call the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-rental-becomes-a-cozy-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">urban residence their permanent home</a>. The couple was leaving behind a six-bedroom house in New Jersey for this mid-town one-bedroom. With that said, they needed an efficient space. That meant an emphasis on storage in the main living areas and bedroom. The kitchen and bathroom had also seen better days. The couple completely redid the two spaces while sticking to the original layout.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>When kids flee the coop, it’s time for change</h2>
<p>Grown children leaving the nest gives parents an opportunity to rethink their lifestyle and their home. For some, that means turning an old bedroom into a gym or office, but for these renovators, it meant tackling kitchens, bathrooms, and living areas to best suit their needs. From a couple looking to downsize to one returning home, learn more about their stories below.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30234 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-723x482.jpg" alt="empty nester remodel, kitchen, living room" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-rental-becomes-a-cozy-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JoAnn and Brian</a> wanted to leave their 4,800-square-foot house in New Jersey to make a one-bedroom they already owned in Manhattan their new home. &#8220;Living in Manhattan had always been a desire. Since we were empty-nesters and our daughter was already living in the city, we decided to renovate our 600-square-foot rental apartment for ourselves,&#8221; they shared. While downscaling by over 4,000-square-feet definitely presented a challenge, a focus on storage in the kitchen and bedroom closets set them up for success.</p>

<p>The guest bathroom in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/75-year-old-hall-bathroom-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ann and Frank’s</a> three-bedroom apartment was almost all original from 1929. They bought the apartment in 1992, but wanted to wait to renovate until their two kids had left home. Their wish list included having a separate walk-in shower in addition to a new tub. To make room for a walk-in shower, they removed the storage closet next to the door. Otherwise, the footprint remained as is, while new tiles and fixtures contributed to the transformation.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-nyc-homecoming-prompts-a-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Margery and Jim</a> had been waiting for their opportunity to return to New York City. &#8220;Jim and I originally worked in New York and then Jim got transferred. We lived in the suburbs of Philadelphia for about 20 years and then when the kids grew up, we said now&#8217;s our chance to move back to the city, because we&#8217;re really city people,&#8221; Margery shared. They purchased an apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops with incredible views that also needed some work. After living in the apartment for six months, they were ready to remodel. The couple worked with their Sweeten general contractor to bring their industrial-meets-modern vision to life, and take down walls to maximize natural light.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Manhattan home renovates with the right materials and storage</h2>
<p><em>Christina had wanted to remodel her circa 1959 studio co-op in Murray Hill for the five years she’d been living in it. The kitchen and the bathroom were dated, lacked storage space, and were poorly lit. Each year, she&#8217;d revisit the idea of remodeling—even meeting with contractors—but the timing never seemed right between personal and professional commitments (she&#8217;s a financial executive). Hearing so many renovation horror stories also made her hesitate. She discovered <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and took the big step forward. Christina <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27878">posted her project,</a> was matched <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractors</a> and made her selection. Here, she tells her story.</em></p>

<em>Guest post by Christina in Manhattan</em></p>
<p>Putting all my renovation fears aside, I felt my 550-square-foot studio space was not an accurate reflection of my style. The kitchen and bathroom were not well thought out, and the apartment really lacked adequate storage space. For the kitchen, I just used to ignore it by avoiding it altogether, but I couldn’t keep doing that. When I finally met the right contractor through the help of Sweeten, I felt the time had arrived to move forward with updating the space.</p>

<p>Even though it was the kitchen and bath renovations that drove me to get started, there were other things that needed updating. The walls were slightly bumpy in some areas, so I had them <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim-coated</a> [spreading a thin coat of joint compound or &#8220;mud&#8221; on the wall, and then scraping it away to leave a smooth layer] to make everything look as sleek as possible. Also as an artist, I have several of my oil paintings hanging throughout the apartment, so the walls were not all that noticeable, but <span style="color: #000000;">once you update one thing, the flaws in other areas really start to show.</span> Although not part of the original plan, the floors were changed. Upgrading the weak lighting was also a high priority.</p>
<p>My vision for the whole apartment was to look serene, timeless, and glamorous—without overdoing it. I wanted to keep things relatively neutral because my artwork adds pops of color; I didn’t want to create additional “noise.”</p>

<p>The small kitchen didn’t support the existing full-size appliances and was awkward to move around in. The refrigerator was too big and the kitchen lacked counter space, mostly due to a huge sink. That was the number one thing I wanted to correct. With little room to put anything (six inches of usable workspace), I ended up using a foldable table hung on the wall. I could not wait to remove that! The cabinets did not go up to the ceiling—another waste of a significant amount of space that could have been used for storage. The overall configuration became more efficient with a smaller sink and new ceiling-height cabinets. Mission accomplished!</p>

<p>In the bathroom, there was an old pedestal-style sink, leaving no storage space underneath. I have a ton of stuff and am also a neat freak, so I needed all the storage space I could get. I love mirrors that double as storage and insisted on having a larger medicine cabinet. This was a challenge because we had building pipes running behind where the cabinet would be fastened. We found a solution by combining two different-sized ones together; it looks amazing. In both the kitchen and bathroom, I paired Calacatta marble with wood-looking floor tiles for continuity. I knew that was the look I wanted even before shopping for materials. My contractor played an integral role in selecting the materials, offering a lot of ideas on what would look good and what might not work. He also helped <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customize the kitchen cabinets</a>.</p>
<p>I admit I have expensive taste, and sometimes I got carried away with wanting very high-end materials. My contractor helped me stay on track and we found a lot of reasonably priced options at Home Depot for things like light fixtures.</p>

<p>The original floors were damaged by water from a pipe bursting. I wanted a high contrast between the floors and walls and couldn’t believe what a huge difference it gave to the look and vibe of the apartment. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproof layer</a> was included per the building’s request. The entire removal and installation was surprisingly a relatively fast process.</p>
<p>I was most excited about redoing the kitchen; that was the area that bothered me the most. The thought of having everything finally the way I wanted it (within the constraints of the building requirements and existing structure) made me very happy. I was also really excited to be involved in every aspect of the project and learning about construction in Manhattan. After investing a lot of time and energy into the new finishes and design, I feel a greater sense of emotional ownership towards everything in my home. I&#8217;ve been traveling a lot lately, but I can&#8217;t wait to leverage the new appliances and kitchen to their full potential.</p>
<p>The space is now an accurate reflection of my style and personality. It makes me feel at peace and happy to come home every day knowing every single thing is exactly how I wanted it. I feel a great sense of pride in the final product.</p>

			<h2>Ron&#8217;s favorite part of the job? Making a difference in someone&#8217;s life</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>At <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1526485446797000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGmWsGjT4WqBep_Yr6-u6UpMAg6sQ">Sweeten</a>, the experts in our network are experienced contractors and design pros we&#8217;d be thrilled to have working in our own homes. We check their licenses, insurance, quality of work, and customer service skills.

</a><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33083 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Sweeten general contractor Ron" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ronald-1-723x480.jpg" alt="general contractor, Brooklyn" width="723" height="480" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out Ron&#8217;s portfolio here</a></p>
<p><strong>What do you love most about construction?</strong></p>
<p>I love that I can transform a space and make it into what the client wants as well as my vision. The gratifying part is the thanks I receive for my work and the fact that I actually made a difference in someone’s life.</p>
<p><strong>If you couldn’t be a general contractor what would you be doing?</strong></p>
<p>I’d be painting.</p>
<p><strong>What are some myths or misconceptions about contractors that you want to set straight?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a misconception that all contractors are cheats and liars. It is a very challenging job, but I do think that contractors who are professional provide an incredible service to the community and I do think that we change lives for the better.</p>

<p><strong>Describe your ideal client.</strong></p>
<p>Someone who is open, knowledgeable, and has a good design sensibility.</p>
<p><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</strong></p>
<p>They should know that I am giving them my &#8220;all,&#8221; I am giving them 100%, and that their interest is my interest. I want to do the best job possible.</p>
<p><strong>If clients have concerns or issues with the project, how would you like them to handle it?</strong></p>
<p>We have an open door policy. If you have an issue with something, call us, talk to us—we are very responsive.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite renovation that you&#8217;ve done?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of my most recent renovations was renovating an 1839 brownstone in Brooklyn for a young couple. The experience was really awesome because they were very much involved and at the same time they totally respected and loved my crew and fed them almost every day. It just made the whole process incredibly joyful and pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>How do you like your coffee?</strong></p>
<p>Strong and…strong.</p>
<p><strong>Bagel or donut?</strong></p>
<p>Bagel.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite cuisine?</strong></p>
<p>I love Japanese cuisine, I do.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite New York restaurant?</strong></p>
<p>Nobu is one of my favorite New York restaurants.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite borough?</strong></p>
<p>Brooklyn is my favorite.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Some of our favorite projects, big and small, in this booming neighborhood</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the Barclays Center on the north end and the farmer’s market at the Grand Army Plaza on the south end, Brooklyn&#8217;s Prospect Heights has something for everyone. From its historic architecture to its tree-lined streets, and with close proximity to Manhattan, it’s no wonder so many Sweeten renovators call it home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22777 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel and Eric’s apartment</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joel and Eric already lived in the neighborhood (and loved it!), but ended up expanding their search for a larger apartment to include neighborhoods from Hamilton Heights to Jackson Heights and Brooklyn Heights. After a long search, they found what they were looking for&#8230;in the building next door. The one-bedroom, located in the heart of Prospect Heights, was brimming with potential. Its kitchen, with its dark cabinetry and metallic silver walls, was swapped for a more modern palette, including white, charcoal gray, and wood tone for added warmth. The pièce de résistance, a custom, wraparound counter that joins the kitchen to the living room, makes it easy to entertain.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20293 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-new-kitchen-makes-way-for-two-new-arrivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah and Oleg’s apartment</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The small galley kitchen in Sarah and Oleg’s one-bed, one-bath co-op had always bothered them. They knew they wanted to do something with it someday. Thinking of growing their family, “someday” became “right away,” and the couple turned to a full kitchen renovation that would also convert their dining area into a nursery. The space opened up, allowing the kitchen to become a U-shape, and bright white cabinets replaced the old, wood tone ones. And just in time for two new arrivals (twins!), the dining area was closed off as a separate bedroom with sliding doors. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28682 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-723x1175.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="1175" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-723x1175.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-185x300.jpg 185w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-554x900.jpg 554w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/prospect-heights-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marissa’s bathroom</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marissa’s one-bed, one-bath co-op hadn’t been touched since the early &#8217;80s, and it showed. Persistent leaks, dropped ceilings, and builder-grade fixtures made the space feel neglected and unloved. Drawing inspiration from her six-year-long career as an off-Broadway lighting designer, Marissa planned a dramatic makeover for the space. Black paint paired with white subway tile provides contrast while a petite, crystal-adorned chandelier adds a touch of glam. The finished space is smart, sophisticated, and wildly popular on Sweeten&#8217;s social media.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28684 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01-723x496.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="496" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01-723x496.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01-300x206.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01-600x412.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/before-after-kaija-and-johns-prospect-heights-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaija and John’s kitchen</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking for a bigger home led Kaija and John to a one-bed, one-bath co-op in Prospect Heights. The priority was finding a sizable kitchen, one that could hold all of their appliances, including the ones that had been shipped and stored in Kaija’s parent’s basement in Minnesota. A gut renovation of their new kitchen was deemed necessary. The project centered on removing a half wall and creating a custom island with enough storage to stash an arsenal of kitchen gadgets. Inspired by the look of cement, the couple chose poured concrete for the island’s countertop. The addition of open shelves allowed them to put some of their larger appliances—like their attractive stand mixer—on display.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">First-time homeowners Amy and Nick wanted to buy in Brooklyn but didn’t want a space that needed a lot of work. That changed when they came across a two-bed, one-bath condo in Prospect Heights that had a layout that felt perfect for them. The first step was to free the kitchen from the triangular nook it was trapped in. Combining the kitchen and living room gave the kitchen plenty of room to grow. Aiming to create a space that would be ideal for both cooking and entertaining, a supersized kitchen island was installed and topped with Calacatta gold marble. Now the kitchen is the couple’s favorite spot to hang out.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to #2 in our series, Q&amp;A with Jean, in which I hope to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating. We hear your questions every day and work happily to bring you answers through our team and blog. Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings a new set of circumstances and new queries with it. Feel free to email me at JBrownhill@sweeten.com. In the meantime, I’ll even include questions that I get asked most often—even at cocktail parties!</p>
<p>Today our question is about the costs of home renovation in New York City; if this topic interests you, I&#8217;d suggest checking out our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bath</a> cost guides, including <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Budget Basics: Renovation Costs Per Square Foot</a>.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Why is renovating in New York City so expensive?</p>
<p><strong>JEAN:</strong> Like a lot of things in NYC, it comes down to logistics. For a general contractor to transport the drywall and studs—not mention the many other materials and tools necessary for the job—to your home, the planning can be really complicated. Not only does the team need to get everything to your apartment building, they need to get it up to your floor. Sometimes that means coordinating with an elevator, but in some cases, it can mean using a crane and craning in materials. What adds to the high cost of the materials part of a bid is the logistics.</p>
<p>The labor side of the equation is equally complicated. A lot of renovation projects going on simultaneously in the city and every contractor needs a tiler, a plumber, an electrician, etc. In order to survive the competition, he/she has to pay a premium to get a crew to show up at your job site. It all comes down to supply and demand. There are only so many skilled laborers in the city, and getting those laborers plus materials to your apartment can be challenging. Even for a house in Brooklyn, the crew still has to drive through traffic and bring the drywall from a warehouse that&#8217;s likely stationed in another borough, like Queens. Overall, it’s the cumulative expense of coordinating the drivers, trucks, and deliveries, plus having someone ready to accept deliveries and bring it to your home, that really drives up the cost.</p>

<p><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></p>
<p>I’m from New York, born and raised in Queens. I’ve been in construction for almost 15 years now.</p>
<p><strong><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;How did you get into construction?&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,17153,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,null,1&#093;">How did you get into the field?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I kind of fell into the industry by mistake. It started with a part-time job while I was in high school working for a friend of the family who had a pretty big construction company. I have some family background in the industry but never gave it any thought. I had always thought of myself as a finance guy but realized I just loved speaking and working with people. I really liked engaging new clients, hearing about their prospective projects, and learning what they were looking to do—and it kind of snowballed from there. Being on jobs and seeing what you uncover during the work, how you fix it and seeing the end result is all really exciting.</p>
<p><strong><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;What do you love most about construction?\n&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,17153,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,null,1&#093;">What do you love most about construction?</span></strong><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;What do you love most about construction?\n&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,17153,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,null,1&#093;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the things I really love is seeing the progression. I love how we take something and have the ability to completely change it; it’s so cool. Seeing a job from start to finish is a lot of fun. My favorite part of the creative side is when we’re going through the planning and the &#8220;teasing out ideas&#8221; phase with our clients—I really enjoy that. Of course, it’s fun to meet new people as well; we’re dealing with different personalities, styles, and properties on a daily basis. There’s always something new around the corner. Needless to say, my job never gets boring!</p>
<p><strong><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;What is your ideal client?&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,17153,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,null,1&#093;">Who is your ideal client?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My ideal client is someone who doesn’t want to be their own general contractor and who can really trust and confide in us for our opinion. This way, we can truly have a collaborative effort in creating a great space for them. Most of our clients are professionals who don&#8217;t have the time to do everything and appreciate the high level of service we provide.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lot of people think that their project is going to be very quick, be able to start the very next day, and be inexpensive, because it’s just a small kitchen or just a small bathroom—they just saw an entire renovation on a television show, which was really weeks or months of work in just 30 minutes! Budgets and timelines! Good things take some time, right? You need to have a professional who has all the proper credentials, certifications, licenses, insurances and really gets the process. Most importantly, you need someone you can gel with. That’s the only way you’ll get the right outcome. For a lot of people we speak to, we need to be clear that there is almost always a wait to start a project. We are usually booked out several months in advance to begin physical work, although we begin working behind-the-scenes right away.</p>
<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge you face when renovating in New York?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the biggest challenges for us is the number of building management companies and how they operate. They all have different turnaround times which can affect a project&#8217;s timeline and can be hard to forecast. Each individual building has its own quirks as well. We work through these things, but it can be challenging at times.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite New York City restaurant?</strong></p>
<p>Joe’s Shanghai is an all-time favorite of mine in New York City. Ultimate comfort food.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite New York City building?</strong></p>
<div>
<p>The Freedom Tower. It has a special meaning to me and many other New Yorkers. To me, it represents progress.

The owner, Fabian - he is actually British\u00a0working for JP Morgan -\u00a0that was an absolutely amazing and positive guy too. I really think after all these years in the industry\u00a0that the result of the project depends on the client also.

<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge you face when renovating in New York?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;The biggest challenge is the time, I think. Even people that invest in properties and they really want to rent it. Time means money for them, especially an apartment like that. They can rent it for seven, eight, or ten thousand a month. They are losing money, so if we lose the timeline, they are losing money. So I think this is the biggest challenge. Finish the project on time.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;">The biggest challenge is time. People who invest in real estate properties and want to rent them out—time means money for them. They can rent it for seven, eight, or ten thousand a month, so if we don&#8217;t complete the project on time, they are losing money. </span></p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;I realize so far that there are many details that cause problems in a project. One thing-- and we usually do it. We do it very often, too. We accept work, and we let the owners purchase the material. Which means that this causes, many times, delays. Let's say, \&quot;Kitchen cabinets.\&quot; I would say 50% of the times the the cabinets come in the apartment, and they are missing parts. So this causes a very big delay. And because, usually everything is custom made, and somebody orders something,\u00a0it takes probably another three weeks to come. And then the counter top guys want to come and measure. It's going to take them another\u00a0at least a week to come and install it. So this makes the homeowners nervous. I think that this is the most important thing.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;">A misconception is that they save money by ordering and handling the deliveries themselves. When we let homeowners purchase materials, there are often delays. Let&#8217;s say kitchen cabinets, I would say 50% of the time, cabinets arrive at the apartment with missing parts. This causes a very big delay, and since everything is usually custom, it probably takes another three weeks to be delivered. Then the countertop guys want to come and measure and that takes at least another week to schedule and install.</span></p>

<p><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m from Albania. I&#8217;ve been in construction for about seven years.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;Started from school as a civil engineer.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;Meeting different people. We're from Sweeten. I've gotten the chance to meet so many incredible people.

<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;Misconception?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A licensed GC brings protection and accountability to your project</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47784 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>You’ve spent months, even years, dreaming up your home renovation. You’ll want to hire a licensed*, experienced, and professional general contractor to execute the remodel. Make note that the term &#8220;licensed&#8221; can also be referred to as registered or certified.</p>
<p>*An important note: <em>Sweeten contractors are fully licensed in states that have licensing laws. Some states in the United States such as Texas does not license contractors.</em></p>
<p>Renovations can stretch budgets, making it tempting to go with a lower quote from someone who is unlicensed. However, in the long run, this can cost you more—in some cases, a LOT more—if anything goes wrong or the work isn’t up to par. Renovation matchmaker <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> vets all the contractors in its network, and checks in on the project until it’s completed. Cities, states, and towns have varying degrees of requirements for a licensed contractor, but chances are, if you&#8217;re hiring a licensed general contractor he or she will likely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be required to have insurance</li>
<li>Be required to be bonded</li>
<li>Have gone through a criminal background check</li>
<li>Have taken and passed a contractors’ exam</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s why every home remodel should be done by a licensed building professional:</p>
<h3>When do you need to hire a licensed general contractor?</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Projects in New York City that require a license include basement conversions, demolitions, bathroom or kitchen remodels, and wall additions. <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/industry/master-electricians.page"><span class="s2">Specialty skills</span></a> such as an electrician or plumber must have their own license that is specific to their trade even if they are operating as a subcontractor.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">In California, a licensed general contractor is a must for any project above $500. Electrical and plumbing trades must also be licensed for jobs over $500 and are required to take a different exam from a general contractor (more on that below).</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s3">Check your local building department</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The maximum value of a project that can be completed without a license varies from state to state and county to county. It is wise to check with your state and local building department for what project type and size calls for a licensed contractor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In New York City, projects under $200 can be done by someone without a license. Jobs under $500 in California, such as painting can also be completed by someone without a license.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Whether you live in the suburbs or city in most areas of the country, it is very likely that all but the smallest home improvement projects, like swapping out a faucet or painting room, will require a licensed general contractor. </span><span class="s1">Anyone taking on a project over your area’s minimum without a contractor&#8217;s license is doing so illegally. Besides breaking the law, there is no accountability if an issue should arise (more about that below).</span></p>
<h3>You want a contractor who has insurance for your protection</h3>
<p>Your home insurance might cover a few things, but when something goes wrong with a renovation, an average policy won’t cover everything. For example, if a bathtub is installed incorrectly and causes water damage to your floor, your home insurance might cover the water damage. However, it won’t help you when it comes to fixing that shoddy installation job.</p>
<p>With people working in your home, you are something of a pseudo employer. If any workers are injured while on the job in your residence, you could be vulnerable to a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Those reasons are why licensed general contractors are required to carry two types of insurance:</p>
<ul>
<li>General liability insurance: This covers the contractor against any third-party lawsuits involving injury to a person or damage to property. For instance, if your contractor reverses into your neighbor&#8217;s car, the cost of damage is covered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your state, city, or county will dictate a minimum for general liability insurance. In New York City, it is $1 million. If you are remodeling an apartment, your co-op or condo board could request over and above the level required to get a licensed professional in your area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Worker’s compensation: This covers any medical costs associated with a workplace injury for anyone working in your home. It also covers lost wages due to a work-related injury.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do contractors need to have insurance in all states or counties? Although uncommon, <a href="https://www.nextinsurance.com/blog/general-contractor-license-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not every region</a> requires a general contractor to have all types of insurance. For example, <a href="https://generalcontractorlicenseguide.com/nebraska-contractors-license/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nebraska</a> only requires GCs to carry worker’s compensation and not general liability insurance. Just to be safe, it is best to check what your state requires as well as the requirements in your local city or county.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A bonded contractor offers another safeguard</h3>
<p>Many jurisdictions require licensed contractors to contribute to bonding, which offers financial help to clients often when insurance doesn’t. Bonding is a pot of money that pays out clients if a general contractor fails to complete a job, doesn’t do the job properly, or damages a home due to negligence.</p>
<p>Bonding is required basically <a href="https://www.markupandprofit.com/articles/state-by-state-guide-to-general-contractor-bond-amounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everywhere</a>. If your state doesn’t require it, then your local area will. To get a license in New York City, contractors are required to pay $200 into a trust fund with the Department of Consumer Affairs or prove they have a surety bond through a third party. In California, a bond is always done through a third party licensed by the state.  Similar to insurance, the contractor pays a fraction of the bond amount required to a third party, who agrees to pay out the full bond amount if it is needed.</p>
<p>In other states, <a href="https://www.bryantsuretybonds.com/contractor-license-bond/illinois" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like Illinois</a>, there are different bond amounts for different types of work. For example, plumbing contractors must have a $20,000 bond, whereas roofing contractors only need $10,000. Again, as with California, the contractor pays a fraction of this amount to a third party. General contractors in<a href="https://www.suretybonds.org/contractor-license-bonds/florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Florida </a>only need to be bonded if their FICO credit score is below 660.</p>
<h3>Most areas conduct a criminal background check</h3>
<p>Most areas will put applicants through a criminal background check. However, a criminal record won’t automatically disqualify someone from getting their license. It’s likely the licensing department will assess each applicant individually, weighing factors such as the severity of the crime, if it is related to an individual being able to carry out the functions of a contractor, and evidence that indicates rehabilitation.</p>
<h3>Passing a contractor’s exam</h3>
<p>It is common to sit for an exam before a license is issued. How difficult that test is and what questions are asked can vary greatly from area to area. In New York City, 21 out of 30 questions must be answered correctly to pass the exam and be taken by a sole proprietor or general partner owning 10% or more of the company. The questions focus primarily on the knowledge of the city’s regulations and best practices. Examples are “Must a contractor furnish a consumer with a written estimate?” and “What are the penalties for false or fraudulent representation?”</p>
<p>California requires two tests. One is a more general law and business examination that all building professionals must take. In 2018, more than 51,000 exams were scheduled, according to California’s Contractors State License Board. The other is more specific to a contractor’s line of work: general engineering contractor, general building contractor, or specialty contractor. The second test takes more than three hours and contains technical questions such as “According to the California Residential Code, what is the minimum allowable width of a residential hallway?”</p>
<h3>How to check a general contractor’s license</h3>
<p>Always request and check for an HIC number. Many areas make this easily accessible and the information is often through a city or county’s consumer affairs department. For New York City, there is an online search tool where you can check whether a contractor’s license is legitimate and current (a license in the Big Apple lasts for <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/industry/general-contractor-registration.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three years</a>). <span style="font-weight: 400;">In California, where licenses are renewed every two years, there is</span> a similar <a href="https://www2.cslb.ca.gov/onlineservices/CheckLicenseII/checklicense.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online tool</a>.</p>
<p>The United States is a patchwork of state, city and county regulations with licensing requirements differing from place to place but the process your licensed contractor will likely have had to undergo will be similar. In some cases, such as with California, licensing is handled at the state level. In other states, such as New York, licensing is mostly handled by counties. But in some cities, like New York City, it is handled at a city level.</p>
