Guest post by Clinton Hill homeowner Brian Kaplan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2009, we embarked on a six-month-long gut renovation. It included demolishing multiple walls to open the kitchen to the living room, removing rough stucco ceilings and refinishing them and installing new wood flooring throughout. The project occurred before we had our son, although Erin was pregnant for part of the time, which was a motivating factor to get it done! We then took a long hiatus but knew we’d be back at it someday. There are always more projects.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22961 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Prospect Heights bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-Before-01-723x952.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-Before-01" width="723" height="952" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22968 size-chrono" title="Prospect Heights bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-723x1084.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01" width="723" height="1084" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Six years later, we turned to the next <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big project</a>: refinishing the only bathroom in the apartment. It was in part prompted by necessity: a leak from an upstairs bathroom ruined our ceiling. And although we had done a large part of the work in our 2009 renovation ourselves, different circumstances this time led us to choose Sweeten to help us get it done. We knew that the project couldn’t be a weekend project, and most of the work—tiling, plumbing, etc—in a bathroom is highly specialized. Our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3204" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> was able to assist us in making sure we ordered all the correct things, and coordinated with and supervised the subcontractors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fixtures and finishes were typical of ‘80s renovations—functional but tired. A couple of plumbing issues initiated the beginning of the renovation project. We knew we wanted something different from the common renovations in our building. I had spent a lot of time recently traveling for work so hotel bathrooms were the inspiration—however humble our own footprint: the clawfoot tub in the Hotel Condesa DF, the basin sink in the Park Hyatt Dubai, the plumbing fixtures in the Four Seasons in Guangzhou, and the light fixtures in the Hotel Tremezzo on Lake Como.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22963 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Prospect Heights bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-03" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22965 size-chrono" title="Prospect Heights bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The finishes are fairly simple but employed thoroughly—by selecting a clawfoot tub, the floor and wall tile automatically continue through the space a built-in tub would occupy, enriching the surfaces. We also continued the simple subway tile to the ceiling on all four walls to further enhance its impact. The toilet has a slender and tapered base, and the antique basin table is on legs highlighting the indigo glow of the glazed hex floor tile. The custom-fabricated medicine cabinet allows for display and easy access. We were able to partially recess the cabinet, which is made of red balau wood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wall-mounted plumbing fixtures were unusual for our co-op, so it was a bit of a gamble to choose these types of fixtures. We didn’t know what the infrastructure behind the wall would look like. It turned out that the risers needed to be replaced, so we were able to customize our rough-ins.  The coordination with the clawfoot tub was another challenge. We found the basin table online and delivered it home from Hudson, NY, ourselves after a weekend camping and picked up the several-hundred-pound clawfoot tub at the UPS depot under the Kosciuszko Bridge in Brooklyn! A last-second request from our five-year-old son encouraged us to include a hand shower and transfer from the hydrostatic valve (and no, he didn’t actually use that term!). He hated how water got into his eyes with a regular shower, so he asked for his own hand sprayer. And finally, the finishing touch was the bathtub caddy, which reflected the intent of this project to be a retreat from the trials of daily life.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22966 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Prospect Heights bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-05" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22964 size-chrono" title="Prospect Heights bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-07-723x1083.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-07" width="723" height="1083" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with our co-op was a challenge where access to the plumbing chase and replacement of the aging riser was concerned, but our Sweeten contractor was very professional and managed the process as well as possible. We had difficulties working with our first contractor, and Sweeten saved this project by acting swiftly to help us hire a new contractor who understood the desperate situation we were in—with our only bathroom out of service for weeks already at that point. Our contractor worked with a plumber hired by our co-op, supervised the work, and mapped out where everything should be installed. We credit Sweeten and our Sweeten contractor for saving our sanity and completing our project as we’d envisioned it. Thank you!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Brian and Erin, your bathroom renovation was a packed journey, and we thank you for sharing your inspiration with us.</em></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Working with Olga was fun and easy. She has endless amounts of patience and good ideas, and is a very creative problem solver.  I am very grateful to Sweeten for making the connection.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211;Erica S., Brooklyn Homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brooklyn homeowners Erica, documentary filmmaker, &amp; Spencer, photojournalist, have a few unique things in common — they both travel &amp; document the world for their work, and they both come from families of antique collectors. It seems no wonder that they also share a mutual interest in maps. A little over six years ago, during a long search for their first home, the couple walked into a one-bedroom apartment in Windsor Terrace to find a giant map covering an entire wall. They took the map as a sign and made the purchase. A few years later, with the arrival of their daughter, Vivienne, the family started considering options for a larger space, and were eyeing the adjacent one-bedroom for an addition. It turned out the neighbors had a similar idea in mind for themselves, but weren’t positioned to do so yet, so they agreed to sell. For help designing their new home, Erica &amp; Spencer posted <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/657" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their project</a> to theSweeten. Architect &amp; tS member <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1327" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olga Bakic</a> proved to be the family&#8217;s perfect match — read on to learn about their beautifully renovated home!<span id="more-8943"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9015 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/floor-plans-LAYOUT-copy.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="801" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/floor-plans-LAYOUT-copy.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/floor-plans-LAYOUT-copy-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica &amp; Spencer&#8217;s original apartment was 900 sqft, and their neighbors&#8217; space (in grey above) was 750. The homeowners&#8217; main objectives in combining the units were to take down the dividing wall (&#8211;the time had come to part with the map), open up their existing galley kitchen, combine their bedroom &amp; bathroom for a master suite, create a wall of built-in bookshelves, and tear out the second kitchen, which they turned into an office with a built-in desktop.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Olga is extremely patient and dedicated, not to mention a wonderful person.  She listened to and accommodated my opinions, but was also honest enough to (in retrospect) save me from some mistakes.  She has a great design sense.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8972 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Walking in the front door of the renovated space: here, we have a split view of each of the two original apartments &#8212; the closet on the right is located where the neighbors&#8217; entry hall used to be, and everything to the left of it was originally a part of Erica &amp; Spencer&#8217;s home. The map-covered wall that separated the 2 apartments used to be right down the center, along the axis of the dining table.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8973 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/03_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/03_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/03_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spencer &amp; Erica&#8217;s shared love of travel &amp; antiques is expressed in their eclectic collection of artwork, maps, artifacts &amp; furnishings.  The dining table &amp; chairs are all antique; above the dining set is a mirrored chandelier by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjrhU8yTOmg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Ogden</a>, an artisan who collects vintage parts from flea markets, factories &amp; junk yards, and combines them by hand to create beautiful, original pieces. When designing with Olga, the homeowners expressed their interest in adhering to the home&#8217;s existing &#8212; at times quirky &#8212; pre-war style, rather than doing anything too sleek or modern. One of the most prevalent design outcomes of this is the archway openings that were used throughout the new construction to match the old.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8975 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/05_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/05_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/05_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A map in the living room caught our eye and makes a wonderful accent to Erica &amp; Spencer&#8217;s leather Chesterfield sofa, which they picked up at a tag sale in Connecticut.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8976 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/06_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/06_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/06_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the sofa, the family can take advantage of their new open kitchen, and admire its charm! Like the dining room chandelier, the pendant lamps are crafted by Robert Ogden, as well as the stools which he produces for his separate line, <a href="https://lostine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lostine</a>. The wooden bartop is custom made of reclaimed pine from <a href="https://ogtstore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olde Good Things</a>. Cabinets from the original kitchen were re-used in the new design, and a new backsplash was added in <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Merola-Tile-Lantern-12-1-2-in-x-12-1-2-in-White-Porcelain-Mesh-Mounted-Mosaic-Tile-FKOLB10/202101830#.UcM2PPa17fY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merola Lantern tiles</a>, available at Home Depot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8977 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/07_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/07_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/07_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love the master bedroom which features a curated array of vintage furnishings &amp; accessories for a nostalgic, dreamlike space. The antique bed has been Erica&#8217;s since she was a child, but her favorite piece is the star chandelier which belonged to her grandparents. Spencer collects old trunks, so they have a nice, big trunk for the foot of the bed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The homeowners had long wanted a whole wall of bookshelves, so Olga helped them design a built-in unit for their new family room / library. This space could also double as a guest or third bedroom &#8212; a great luxury in the city! Overhead, an antique-inspired pendant from <a href="https://www.rhbabyandchild.com/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=rhbc_prod389109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Restoration Hardware</a> hangs from the ceiling.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;We do not miss the wall &#8211; or the map &#8211; we are thrilled with the space, the layout, the new lifestyle.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Awesome job to Olga for helping to make a new home that is just right for this young, adventurous family &#8212; thanks so much to Erica, Spencer &amp; Vivienne for sharing their unique space!</p>

<p>Thanks for your comment, Virginia! It looks like they have a pretty handy vertical bike rack. Will look into the source!</p>
