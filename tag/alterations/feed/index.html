<span class="img-label"><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-renovations-chikarashi-restaurant-nomad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chikarashi remodel</a> by this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first glance, a commercial lease may appear daunting in its length and complexity. While it’s important for tenants to engage an attorney to represent their interests in negotiating a commercial lease with a landlord, <span style="color: #000000;">it’s to the tenant&#8217;s advantage to fully understand vital lease issues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Part 2, our guide continues to outline elemental—but specific—commercial lease concepts that should be considered by prospective tenants before signing a contract. (See <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-lease-terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 1 here</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commercial leases are fairly straightforward when it comes to basic business terms, including base rent, length of <span style="color: #000000;">lease</span> term, and rent abatement (free rent). An experienced commercial real estate broker can advise on the fundamental elements while helping a tenant to negotiate the business terms of a space transaction—even before a lease is drawn or a real estate attorney is engaged.</p>
<h3>The &#8220;use clause&#8221;</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A commercial lease’s “use clause” restricts the uses permitted on the premises. Prohibitive uses usually include businesses or activities that impinge on the building’s desirability to other tenants, <span style="color: #000000;">from </span>government agencies with diplomatic immunity to specific activities like printing. A tenant will want to be sure that the uses permitted are broad enough to allow all of their probable and possible business activities. The clause also applies to any subtenant or assignee who may occupy the premises during the term of the lease (see below &#8220;On subleasing&#8221;).</p>
<h3>Plans for alterations</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After delivery conditions of the leased premises are satisfied and the space has been turned over to the tenant, any changes or alterations are subject to review and consent by the landlord before they can be performed. The review period for <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation plans</a> should be prescribed in the lease as a quick process. Cosmetic alterations, such as floor covering (generally carpet, wood, tile) and wall covering (generally paint, stain, wallpaper), should be excluded from landlord review.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having architectural plans ready at the beginning of the lease term and attached as an exhibit will save on approval time needed. It will also eat less into the free rent period given by the landlord before rent payments are scheduled to begin.</p>
<h3>Security deposit/&#8221;good guy&#8221; guarantee</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another requirement <span style="color: #000000;">(in New York and some other locations) is that a business principal, who must be a U.S. citizen or green card holder and not a temporary resident, provides </span>a “good guy” limited personal guaranty for most privately-held tenant entities—no matter how credit-worthy the tenant is. The intent is to ensure, in the event of a bankruptcy or some other situation where a tenant stops rent payments, the landlord will not have to serve an eviction to take back possession of the leased premises (in order to lease to a new tenant).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;good guy&#8221; </span>guarantor is personally liable for rent and other financial obligations for only the time the tenant actually occupies the premises. The magnitude of a security deposit usually reflects the creditworthiness of the actual entity, which is either executing the lease or providing a full corporate guaranty and is usually negotiated before a lease is prepared.</p>
<h3>On subleasing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, a tenant cannot sublet or assign the premises without the landlord’s consent. In addition, landlords want sublease rights to be defined in ways that will not diminish their ability to profitably lease other space in the building. A tenant usually cannot sublet to another tenant in the building, but this can be modified so that the tenant may sublease to an existing tenant in the building if no competitive direct space is available from the landlord. Marketing a sublet to prospective building tenants is another restriction that landlords may consider revising.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, a corporate reorganization, including acquisition, which changes the identity of the company leasing space, should not trigger the requirement that the landlord review and provide<span style="color: #000000;"> his approval, as if a whole new and related company was subleasing or being assigned the lease. </span></p>
<h3>SNDA</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SNDA stands for Subordination, Non-Disturbance, and Attornment Agreement. The critical aspect of this concept is that in the event a landlord goes bankrupt and the lender takes over the building, the lender should be required to honor the lease and not &#8220;disturb&#8221; the tenant&#8217;s occupancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a potential commercial tenant, understanding the key points in a commercial lease protects you and your investment. Doing your research and<span style="color: #000000;"> selecting the right advisors gets you one step closer to lifting your business to the</span> next level.</p>

			<h2>Make it easier for a co-op board to approve your home renovation with a few key steps</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22518 size-chrono" title="co-op boards" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/01_300-Riverside_3-723x481.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="481" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-op buildings have unique ownership structures. C-op owners technically lease the space an apartment occupies. A co-op board, and its representative, the management company, have power over any renovations </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’d like to do. Because the board’s role is to protect the interests of all of the owners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the process is less in your control than you&#8217;d think. However, by following a few key practices, you can put your co-op board at ease for your desired remodel.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Simple renovations may not need co-op board approval</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most basic work done in kitchens and bathrooms is known as “rip and replace.” This work includes updating finishes, replacing porcelain plumbing fixtures, and upgrading appliances in their existing locations. For this, your building may not demand a permit; saving you money, time, and general red tape.</span></p>
<h3><strong>How your building will evaluate your plan</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your building is likely to use its own architect to evaluate any renovation plans you submit. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his process is known as an alteration review.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Expect to pay for this service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, typically in the $1,000-$2,000 range</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The architect may flag aspects of the design which seem only tangentially related to your renovation objectives </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(e.g., relocating the intercom). As a result,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> communications can drag on for months. However, the principal concerns of this review will not be aesthetic. Rather, the building architect is charged with protecting the building from liability, plus advising the board about building code requirements. Overall dimensions of rooms, and door openings, may need to be enlarged as part of gut renovations. In other cases, wet areas, like bathrooms and kitchens, may be required to stay within the pre-renovation footprint. This requirement is also known as “wet over wet.” These rules act to protect a downstairs neighbor from flooding after a bathroom upstairs is enlarged over, say, a bed. Also remember that with new plumbing, the building may also require you to replace branch lines all the way back to the main water lines. This may result in additional demolition and expenses.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Bring in your own architect</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For larger jobs, you’ll need your own architect or engineer. Some offer advice on style and design at a premium price. Others will produce a basic set of drawings that can be submitted to the co-op board or management. They may also file renovation plans with the city, in a service known as “architect of record” and “expediter.”</span></p>
<h3><strong>Larger renovations requiring a city permit</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A permit for a larger co-op renovation can sometimes be a judgment call. In extreme cases, your board may decide to make you file for one after work has begun. (Be aware: this can possibly result in fines and other city penalties!) The city will also require you to produce a certificate documenting asbestos tests for areas of the apartment that will be demolished. Asbestos can be found in many places: in plaster or joint compound, in caulking, in linoleum flooring, or even impregnated in the underlayment for wood floors. Should asbestos be present, you will be asked to plan for removal by specialists, or encapsulation. The latter is usually cheaper, leaving asbestos undisturbed and adding new finishes on top, when space and aesthetic considerations allow this.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Legal considerations &amp; co-op rules</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-op board or building likely has already published and distributed alteration terms or as “house rules,” which should be reviewed closely. They often cover things like requirements for working hours, deliveries, and protections mandated for common areas during debris removal. Even in jobs that do not require permits, you will want to provide management with a written scope of work, listing the various upgrades you propose and requesting written permission—at least over email—to proceed.</span></p>
<h3>What is an alternation agreement?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you submit your plans,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the co-op board may ask you to sign an “alteration agreement.” This alteration agreement can include provisions tailored to your particular job. It is not uncommon, especially in blue-chip buildings, for these agreements to encompass punitive regulations. Provisions like time limits for renovations, and daily penalties imposed when jobs are not completed as requested by the co-op board, are not uncommon. These agreements may also<span>—not surprisingly—</span>seek to shift liability for construction to the apartment owner. In cases of particularly punitive agreements, however, you may choose to engage a tenant’s lawyer to negotiate more favorable terms with the building’s legal representative. Typically, you will need to acknowledge the agreement in exchange for the co-op board’s or management company’s signature on your building permit application.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Avoiding problems in a co-op renovation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your proprietary lease may allow inspections, so the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">building architect or superintendent may ask</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have a look around your apartment, should any questions arise about your proposed renovations or even work underway. For this reason, it is worth keeping the apartment clean and tidy, whether you are living there through the renovation, or not. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An environmental testing firm may visit the apartment to monitor lead levels as part of a regular inspection. (This is most likely if your building has a history of lead.)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Don&#8217;t panic—especially if you have an advance warning. State environmental agencies recommend cleaning with a HEPA vacuum for soft surfaces, or soapy water and paper towels for hard surfaces.</span></p>
<h3>Managing relationships with your co-op board</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying in the good graces of your co-op board, and particularly becoming friendly with the board president, can short-circuit potential miscommunications and suspicions based on building gossip. The co-op board has the ultimate discretion to direct the building management in matters regarding the schedule and procedures around your renovation. And if you are hoping any exceptions will be made, neighborliness—to say nothing of cookies or Champagne—may help. Good luck navigating the co-op board to fulfill your renovation dreams!</span></p>
