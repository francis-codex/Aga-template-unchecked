										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jamie and Chad landed their first place in Ridgewood, countless hours researching DIY methods and hosting “bad first dates” with contractors were not enough help for their Tuscan-tiled master bath.

</a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Jamie, Queens homeowner  </span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My husband and I dreamt of buying a brownstone in Bed-Stuy. This dream was apparently shared by everyone else in New York, because trying to find a place—any place—was a humbling experience in getting outbid by foreign investors and other first-time buyers with resources greater than ours. After a year of frustration, we found a condo in a recently remodeled brick building in Ridgewood, Queens—a quirky little Polish-Ecuadorian neighborhood on the Brooklyn-Queens border that none of our friends had ever heard of. The good news was that the apartment was huge: the building’s original six units had been merged into three, giving us a yard and a finished basement to go with our ground-floor living space.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bad news was that the renovations had been undertaken in an aesthetic that my husband and I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">described as “late-life Euro bachelor”: dark wood fixtures and liberal use of large brown Tuscan tiles that gave certain rooms the yellowish air of an Adirondack rental property you’d regret renting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-17412"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17412 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first year in Ridgewood was dominated by DIY projects—refacing cabinets, painting, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gardening—that improved the overall look of our apartment. The projects that remained were too complicated to be mastered through YouTube videos and trial-and-error, which put us on the market for a contractor to do some larger projects. First in line: our trainwreck of a master bathroom, which when we bought the apartment had been renovated in a very dark (read: creepy) and not-so-functional (read: the showerhead didn’t line up with the tub) way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our search for a contractor stretched over a year. I interviewed people from all over—recommendations from coworkers and friends of friends, names from Brownstoner’s community forum, references in interior design books. There was also Angie’s List, which was effective in introducing me to a series of contractors from Long Island and Brooklyn who were well-versed in bathrooms that featured lots of fogged glass and Jacuzzis—not the bright, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ELLE</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Décor</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-type vibe I was going for. These candidates would generally show up, late and complaining about parking in my neighborhood, then tell me how the fixtures I wanted were going to be too expensive for my budget, how they thought the current bathroom was fine as-is, how I should do a better job training my dogs not to bark.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was like a series of first dates that I knew were going to be awful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somewhere in the process I had read about Sweeten, but let’s be clear: I was far too jaded to be anything but skeptical. I went to their site and decided to </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4383" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of sheer desperation. They first connected me with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my Sweeten general contractor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and from day one, I was impressed. He showed up on time, listened carefully to what I was hoping to achieve, and demonstrated strong attention to detail, noticing things like the slope of the floors and the fact that the recessed lights were out of alignment. He was quick to turn around a quote (some contractors took weeks; others required me to follow up multiple times), and was very responsive to my many emails regarding questions and concerns. I took the leap and hired him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-17413"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17413 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the start, working with Erion and his team was a delight. They showed up promptly at 9am each day, motivated and ready to begin work. And these guys worked hard! I swear, I barely saw them stop to eat! Construction debris and dust is part of the deal when you embark on a project like this, but Erion and his team were extremely tidy and took extra care to protect our house and hardwood floors. Even at the end of demo day, our house was surprisingly clean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part of my experience with Erion was his openness to what I wanted and his tireless pursuit of making this a reality. I wanted a bright, clean, fresh, and timeless space—something that would age well with the house and provide a spa-like atmosphere. This bathroom has no natural light, so I made sure to choose materials that reflected light (beveled mirrors, polished nickel fixtures, high-gloss paint). Erion considered all my sourcing decisions, weighing in where I asked him to and letting me handle things everywhere else. I spent a lot of time researching the fixtures I wanted and although the approach was a bit piecemeal (and largely dictated by stores for which I had gift cards), it worked.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the tile we wanted to keep it light and clean and I worked with the lovely people at Ann Sacks. Their showroom is beautiful, pricing competitive, and customer service exceptional. On the bathroom floor, we chose large marble squares (16 x 16) with a honed finish because it’s not as slippery as polished marble and tends to show fewer scratches. We also decided to install radiant heat to keep our toes warm in winter. For the shower walls, I knew I wanted a larger tile (less grout to clean!) but something with a bit more character than subway tile. At first, I was unsure about going with a handmade 6 x 18 tile because each cut was slightly different, but in the end it turned out beautifully and the hand-made nature of the tile gave it a textured appearance that we absolutely love. As for the shower floors, we did a micro-mosaic which makes me happy every time I look down at it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As unexpected challenges or issues arose—as they always do in remodeling—Erion handled them with a calm demeanor, thoroughly explaining my options and letting me know how they would affect factors such as time and cost. He would talk through the pros and cons of various options and together we would make a decision on how to move forward. At no point did I ever feel steamrolled, or like he was cutting corners. Erion demonstrated an exceptional dedication to quality and was just as concerned as I was that everything be done right and look good. The end result is a beautifully serene space and the sort of justification for all my time and anguish that I’d hoped for.</span></p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Postscript: While writing this blog post, our apartment suffered severe water damage from a neighbor’s apartment. The silver lining in this situation is that we knew exactly who to call and who we could trust to do the work. Erion dropped everything to help us navigate this urgent situation, going above and beyond to help us triage damage and map a way forward. He has truly become our technical and professional liaison for maintaining and improving our largest investment, and the confidence I have in his practices, tastes, and commitment to quality cannot be overstated. Thank you, Sweeten, for connecting us.</span></p>

Guest post by Chris, Ditmas Park homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During construction, many people, not least of all our immediate neighbors, asked us why we were renovating our apartment. In the earliest stages, we would say, semi-seriously, that all we had really intended to do before things got out of control was put in a dishwasher. We had quickly realized that re-doing our kitchen was going to be an all or nothing endeavor for us and putting in a dishwasher somehow became ripping our kitchen down to bare studs. But once we found out that our second kid was on the way, the focus of the project became carving out a room for our older son that was just big enough to be useful, but small enough to keep the kitchen a reasonable size. After <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting our project on Sweeten</a> and meeting <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these Sweeten general contractors</a>, we went full steam ahead with their innovative design for our kitchen and new kids&#8217; room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten general contractors understood that we needed to be able to fit a standard-sized crib along one of the crved walls, and that if push came to shove we could alternatively squeeze in a standard twin bed running the other way, just in case we end up staying in the apartment for quite a while longer than we’ve planned. We kept the curved walls of the room as they were since it is a nice pre-war touch that conveys the fact that the room juts out into the facade of the building, forming a miniature bay window with a tiny balcony for plants. We laid a new wood floor and installed a heavy door that swings open to be flush against the wall outside the room, almost making it disappear when it’s open. The other thing that makes it feel so much bigger is that there is a full transom milk glass window along the top of the doorway. It brings light into the kitchen and keeps the partition between the kitchen and our son’s room from dominating.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We only finished the last details of our son’s room a couple months ago: a series of picture shelves from Pottery Barn that we painted to match the walls, a roller blind, and a cheap but cheerful rug from Land of Nod. Honestly, it was knowing that Sweeten was sending a photographer that made us pull it all together!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Halfway through renovating the kitchen, we realized that if we didn’t do the bathroom, it was never going to happen. Our apartment and our lives had already been turned upside down and we knew we were never going to go through it again. The former bathroom had tiling that ran up the sides of the walls which created a tub effect and everything felt very tired and shabby.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We installed large dark gray tiles, replaced the old tub with a Kohler cast iron model, and redid the shower stall which is separate from the bath in clean simple narrow subway tiles from Nemo. The sink and vanity are from IKEA. We raised the ceiling of the stall and installed a ceiling light which makes all the difference. All the fixtures are Grohe, good bang for the buck and they toe the line between modern and classic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17252 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-02-1.jpg" alt="walk-in shower" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-02-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-02-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17251" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-01-1.jpg" alt="all-white bathroom remodel" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-01-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every project ends with a few things that you never quite get to and our wall light in the bathroom is one of them. We kept it in the original spot which is centered on the wall but not over the medicine cabinet. Our contractor was happy to move it but in our hurry to move back in with a two-week-old baby we figured we could live with it. Even now, every time I flip on the light I think of how amazing it felt to be back in the apartment after the work was done, so, I am happy to leave it where it is.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This week, we took a swing through Park Slope for a tour of a boom-era New York bathroom that had understandably gone bust in the intervening, oh, 80 or so years. Elinor and Joel lived with the bathroom&#8217;s pros and cons and got to know it&#8217;s fickle personality well before <a dir="ltr" href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting their project</a> on Sweeten, so they were more than ready to get going when we introduced them to Sweeten Expert Niki to design and build a new bath with a strong link back to its roots. Read on down for this Brooklyn couple’s take on the process of bringing their vintage bathroom into the modern era.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/bathrooms/elinor-and-joels-park-slope-bathroom-renovation-homeowner-guest-post"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13912" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed.png" alt="unnamed" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Guest post by Elinor in Park Slope</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-13906"></span>We bought our Park Slope co-op six years ago knowing that the bathroom would have to be renovated but hoping that we wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about it for several years. The delay was partly about recovering from the process of buying our first place &#8211; which was pretty stressful &#8211; but it probably had more to do with being complete novices when it came to finding, hiring, and working with a contractor. We worried about making mistakes that could both cost us a bundle and do a lot of damage to our home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a 1920s building with a lot of original features, the bathroom still had a beautiful original tub and all of it&#8217;s pre-war tile. The plumbing, however, was also a 1920s original and some bad patches made over the years to the tile and fixtures were starting to fall apart. The medicine cabinet was rusty and so thickly painted that the door no longer closed. Towel rails fell off the wall. The shower started sending more water out of the tap than the shower head. And finally, the old regulator flush toilet sprung a leak that threatened a serious flood. Action was needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13915" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/before-1.jpg" alt="before-1" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/before-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/before-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;d read about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> in an article in the New York Times and, almost on a whim, posted our project. I was surprised by how quickly they got in touch. We were introduced to Sweeten Expert Niki who had also been mentioned in the Times article and whose name I had run across doing independent research. Working with Sweeten gave us that extra confidence to move ahead knowing we had a team that had been screened, but we also liked being able to call up Sweeten to ask questions about practical things like what to expect from the estimate process and how payment schedules are generally set up. Niki&#8217;s team was a great fit because they brought design and build expertise &#8211; we just didn&#8217;t have the time (or patience) to run all over town looking at tile samples and taps and we needed someone to help narrow down all the choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My ideal was to somehow bring the bathroom back to its shiny, original look by restoring the tile rather than starting from scratch and replacing it all. But it quickly became clear that to sort out the plumbing and move the shower head, the wall tile would have to come down and objectively, it really was too far gone to save. With that decision made, we chose materials that were as close to the originals as possible, which meant polished chrome fixtures from <a href="https://www.barclayproducts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barclay</a> (the tub filler and hand-shower), and a thermostatic control, shower head, and sink tap all from <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler</a>. We found a shiny metal medicine cabinet from <a href="https://rh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Restoration Hardware</a> and continued the original tile surround with classic subway tile in a soft cream finish (&#8220;bone gloss&#8221;) rather than the more modern pure white. We couldn&#8217;t quite replicate the original black and white frieze near the top, so we chose a plain black tile as a contrast trim instead &#8212; all from <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nemo Tile</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13919" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01" width="600" height="406" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-01-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13920 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-02.jpg" alt="rejuvenation vanity bathroom renovation" width="600" height="793" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-02-227x300.jpg 227w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13926 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-07.jpg" alt="benjamin moore teal" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SWEETEN_ElinorBathroom-07-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original tub stayed and was reglazed; Niki and team also managed to save the original black and white floor tile. They built a new vanity with a Carrera marble top and glass pulls found on <a href="https://www.rejuvenation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rejuvenation</a>, which provides a lot of storage in a small space. They also added a modern light switch and gfi outlet so that I could finally use a hairdryer without crouching by an outlet in the bedroom. Accessories from <a href="https://www.potterybarn.com/shop/bath/?cm_type=gnav" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pottery Barn</a>, including the towel rail, glass shelf, and wall-mount light fixture fit right in with our mix of old and new. The new <a href="https://www.totousa.com/products/toilets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toto toilet</a> is light years beyond the its predecessor&#8230;no explosions or leak floods in our future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bit that no amount of research can prepare you for is how frazzled you will become: no matter how hard you try, your sense of humor will fail and you will be THAT client at some point in the process. And working with even the nicest of co-op boards will take a minimum of three months when plumbing is involved. It&#8217;s just hard to be realistic about those things up front. Niki managed the setbacks gracefully and the team worked really well with our building`s team, which is a huge help in keeping relationships friendly with your super and the neighbors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that it&#8217;s done, we love our new space and every morning I can enjoy taking a shower in the new thermostatically-controlled rainwater shower. The paint color (<a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Moore&#8217;s &#8220;Nearly Teal&#8221;</a>) never fails to cheer me up. It really is a shinier, happier version of its original self, minus the exploding toilet&#8230;!</p>

<p>This week we stopped in to see a finished project that was awarded to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>. The homeowners converted their under-stair closet space into a personal wine bar in an apartment on the Upper West Side. The new bar-topped niche is the perfect place to store and display the couples&#8217; wine collection, and it also doubles as a breakfast bar, making it an expansion of their small galley kitchen. Happy with their new space, the homeowners told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our contractor was very professional, contactable (important!), and has great suggestions. [We] would definitely recommend his team.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the project from start to finish.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19539" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-01.png" alt="sweeten_winebar-before-01" width="600" height="804" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-01.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-01-224x300.png 224w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Here is the photo the homeowners included when <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project to Sweeten</a> showing their double-door, under-stair closet space. The closet would be just the right fit for a wine cooler, cabinet, and wall-mounted shelving.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19540" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-02.png" alt="sweeten_winebar-before-02" width="600" height="274" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-02.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-02-300x137.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The couple already had some ideas in mind for wood shelving. Here are some of their inspiration images which they also posted to their project on Sweeten.</p>
<p><span id="more-5187"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19544" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-04.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-during-04" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-04-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The work began last month when their contractor cleared out the space, giving it smooth walls, fresh paint, and wired new lighting for the bar.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19542" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-during-02" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-02-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The next step was to assemble and install the small cabinet and wine-cooler. The homeowners chose this cabinet from the <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martha Stewart</a> collection available at Home Depot the style is Weston in Persian Grey.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19546 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-02" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-02-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19553 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-01-1.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-01" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-01-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Here is the finished view &#8211;we love the clever use of space! As well as the pop of color added by the red Tabouret stools, available on <a href="https://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Tabouret-24-inch-Red-Metal-Counter-Stools-Set-of-2/5095629/product.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Overstock</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19547" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-03.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-03" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-03-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The homeowners chose an elegant bartop in Carrara marble, also available through <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Kitchen-Countertops-Backsplashes-Countertop-Samples/Stonemark-Granite/N-5yc1vZc3boZb0i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>. Above, wine bottles are displayed on reclaimed wood shelving from <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West Elm</a>. The homeowners told us that they opted against custom shelving when they found these attractive shelves for such a great price. However, their contractor pointed out that the iron shelf brackets are a perfect match to the apartment&#8217;s stair railing—so, in the end, these off-the-shelf shelves actually appear customized.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19548" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-04.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-04" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-04-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>New lamps with dimmers were also added. We love the hand-blown look of the pendants, similar to this glass pendant available at <a href="https://www.potterybarn.com/products/clift-seeded-glass-pendant/?pkey=cchandeliers-pendants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pottery Barn</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19549" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-05.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-05" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-05-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Sometimes we forget how essential our storage is &#8211;they&#8217;ve got just enough cabinet space to keep the niche looking clean and stylish, with all the extras stowed away.</p>
<p><em>Many thanks to the homeowners for sharing their awesome new wine bar!</em></p>
