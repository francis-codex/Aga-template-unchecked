<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Homeowners:</strong> Geoffrey, an architect, and Alicia, who works in operations at a FinTech startup, posted their modern <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/123489#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room remodel</a> on Sweeten</li>
<li><strong>Where:</strong> Manhattan on Central Park South</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> An updated living room creates custom zones with millwork and additional walls in their one-bedroom apartment</li>
<li><strong>With:</strong> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Homeowner&#8217;s quote:</strong> &#8220;Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">An opportunity to invest in Central Park South</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the pandemic, we saw a lot of people giving up on New York, and thought it was the perfect time to double down. We drew a box around the southern half of Central Park and started searching. A lot of units had recently been taken off the market but we reached out to realtors to see if the sellers were still interested in making a move. We found our home in an ideal building and location, and made an offer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowners and their dog" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52587" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our 1,000-square-foot apartment is in an iconic mid-century building on Central Park South, which we felt offered us the best of all worlds. The Upper East and Upper West sides were easy to get to, and we love being able to spend our weekends alternating between the two.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A love of pre-war layouts</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the past, we’d always lived in pre-war buildings with architectural character and well-defined floor plans. You don’t get a lot of that in modern buildings like the mid-century one we landed in, so we created our own. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, and hired our general contractor. </span></p>
<div></div>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg" alt="dining room and modern living room remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52579 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wouldn&#8217;t be adding molding, chair rail, or opening up the kitchen, which are so popular these days. Instead, our plan was to define the layout in discrete ways that would <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create separate zones</a>—a proper entry foyer, a generous space for dining, and a desk niche.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our apartment’s original living room was 13 feet across and more than 30 feet long, so we had plenty of space to work with. Our goal was to create a more intimate and purposeful space that could be used for entertaining as well as a dedicated workspace for those work-from-home days.</span></p>
<h3>Creating niches in a modern living room remodel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like most New Yorkers, this was all about maximizing the available square footage. We had an opportunity to divide the extra-large living space for different purposes. By adding a small wall near the entrance to the apartment, we created a foyer on one side and an office area on the other. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the living room, the focal point was a 14-foot wall with custom-designed millwork crafted from European white oak and marble. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/carrara-vs-calacatta-marble-what-is-the-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single slab of Carrara marble</a> houses an electric <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-remodel-on-the-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace</a> and a recessed TV. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg" alt="modern living room remodel with niche office desk" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52584 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">&#8220;[M]ake sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the winter, the apartment could feel a bit dreary (our courtyard views prevent us from getting a ton of natural light). Installing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/adding-fireplace-renovation-gas-wood-burning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace would turn up the cozy-dial</a>, and we designed the entire living space around that idea. We couldn’t do a real fireplace and weren’t interested in dealing with the hassle of gels or fuel logs. We chose a beautiful electric fireplace that was the most convincing artificial unit we could find.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The white oak used throughout the renovation featured strong horizontal lines echoing the building’s iconic mid-century exterior. The material also helped brighten up the space. Bump-outs of the walls near the window created a defined dining area. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Marble slab realities</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The single biggest issue during the renovation was with the large slab of Carrara marble that would clad the front of our fireplace and media wall. It was 7 feet tall and about 5 feet wide, and we insisted that it have mitered corners. We had no idea what an ordeal it would be—the mitered corners were fragile, and a slab that size was very unwieldy. Maneuvering it through the parking garage and up the freight elevator was a half-day exercise that culminated in hours of positioning, tweaking, and polishing. We were scared the entire time that this 500-pound piece of marble would break and we’d have to start all over!</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Align your budget and your expectations</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My advice to renovators? Really <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dig into the contractors</a> you’re interviewing. Make sure that you’re 100% sure that they can do the kind of work that you want, and make sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In terms of our budget, we did pretty well and came within <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1% of the projected cost</a>. It was about $35,000 including the fireplace. Overall, we couldn’t be happier. The space is doing <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything we wanted it to</a>, and we’re excited to cozy up in front of the “fire” this winter.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are Jenna and Hagan, now parents to two daughters: Clay, 2, and Sloan, 7 months. Henry, our dog, lives here, too. When we found the house, we were still expecting our second child and I was working from home due to the pandemic. More space and some rooms to relax in were all we could think about.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>A mid-century remodel focused on good bones with potential</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Our ranch-style home, in the Chastain Park neighborhood, comprises 3,000 square feet. It has a backyard with mature trees, and the house benefits from pretty views and lots of natural light. The interior was traditionally styled, and we liked it. We felt, however, that we could make it work better for our family, and set out to do that. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and the team quickly sourced four quality contractors for us to consider. We soon <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6751#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a general contractor</a> who inspired our confidence. </span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We brought floorplans to our meetings, as layout changes were the most challenging part of the project. Our house had a lot of storage space that we saw a potential to put to better use. These would include the bedroom areas as well as more useful spaces for the kitchen area.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the den, our contractor removed a large built-in shelf that had started to separate from the wall. We also painted this room and stained the floor dark brown.</span></p>

<span class="s1">&#8220;The contractor replaced the windows top to bottom to improve insulation. We could see early signs of rotting wood in the old windows.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A new bay window brightens the kitchen</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The plan for the kitchen included putting in a bay window in the existing breakfast nook and installing Dolomite marble countertops. We ordered a new kitchen sink and added a subway tile backsplash. We kept the existing cabinets, switching out the knobs for a fast refresh. To increase function in this section of the house, we turned to old closets. Opening up the boxed-in space of the four lining the back hallway made space for a butler’s pantry with a second fridge. We also built a laundry room in this area in a follow-up to the larger renovation. </span></p>

<h3>Transforming closets for a master suite</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the back of the house, closets (again) and one of the offices gave their square footage to enlarge our master suite and another bedroom. For the master suite, we imagined a large, open bedroom area looking out into the backyard. We would also add a walk-in closet, a big bathroom, and a powder room. The remap worked brilliantly. An existing door was repurposed as a sliding barn door and leads to our master walk-in closet. The contractor built a secret door at its back that lets us quickly get to the kids’ bedrooms during the night. It has come in handy!</span></p>

<h3 class="p4">Three bathrooms with new tile</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bathroom renovations came next. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/how-to-save-on-home-remodeling-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We did them economically</a>—as in almost simultaneously. Each bath got new tile, though we retained usable fixtures and hardware</span><span class="s1"> where we could. At one point, we had three bathrooms torn up. The one in use had a shower only, and our two-year-old was terrified of showers! We were pleased when the child’s bathroom, replete with new tub and penny tile floor, was finished—not to mention the other three. Our beautiful master bath, with a freestanding fluted bathtub, a glass-walled shower, and double sinks got the full marble treatment. The color palette was a mix of gray and white, including sleek large-sheet floor tiles</span><span class="s1">. </span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Whole-house improvements for curb appeal</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Much of the house had hardwood flooring in need of refinishing. From the bedrooms to the living room, den, foyer, and kitchen, the contractors sanded and stained them. In another global redo, the contractor replaced the windows top to bottom to improve insulation. We could see early signs of rotting wood in the old windows. The new kitchen bay window </span><span class="s1">looks great from the inside and <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/curb-appeal-goes-a-long-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhances the home’s curb appeal</a>. The house would also get a new coat of exterior paint. </span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A Sweeten general contractor to count on</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Through it all, our Sweeten contractor was reliable and competent. He was diligent with the permitting process, a delay-ridden challenge during Covid. (Key takeaway: Be 100 percent sure you need a permit and factor it into your timeline!) Our contractor was transparent on costs, and his efforts resulted in a pleasing final product.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It’s been a feat, but finally, we feel settled. Jenna and I waited so long for our master suite—it feels magical to have our own space. The girls, and Henry the dog, are happy. We are home.</span></p>

<h3>Remodeling an outdated 80&#8217;s West Village kitchen</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36013 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-36010 size-full" title="jonathan-standing-in-kitchen-with-wife" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01.jpg" alt="jonathan standing in his kitchen with his wife in front of white kitchen cabinets and herringbone pattern subway tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<div></div>
<p>Though Erin and Jonathan’s West Village kitchen in their 750-square-foot apartment was, for the most part, functional, it didn’t suit their style. Another downside: the kitchen did not make the best use of the available space. Open to the living area, there was plenty of room to add the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in island</a> on the couple’s wish list, plus reimagine the layout. Ready to bid farewell to the ‘80s cabinetry and shabby tile flooring, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project to Sweeten</a> and were matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a general contractor</a>.</p>
<h3>Picking renovation materials and kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36018 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="waterfall-marble-island-with-pendant-lights"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floor and waterfall marble island with pendant lights and white walls after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36013 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36018 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-36018 size-full" title="waterfall-kitchen-island-with-cabinet-drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floor and waterfall marble island with pull out drawers inside cabinets and pendant lights after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The basic kitchen transformed into a bright, modern marvel complete with new stainless steel appliances, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/sleek-waterfall-island-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall island</a>, and light fixtures. The overall contemporary culinary space also got some more classic updates, like the Shaker-style cabinets and herringbone tile backsplash. To connect the kitchen with the rest of the living area, 5-inch white oak flooring was installed throughout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A French door refrigerator replaced the older model, while the new dishwasher (that has a window and lights up!) moved to the stove&#8217;s previous location. A stainless steel hood and gas range found a new central location in the space across from the storage-packed island.</p>
<h3>Working through the renovation process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor brought the couple’s vision to life, ensuring everything was on time and on budget. “The contractor’s app was also a very helpful tool for us to make material selections and track the progress of the project,” Jonathan said. Their contractor provided valuable input, guiding them on sourcing materials, layout, and space considerations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The entire process was intimidating. From planning, scheduling, prepping, and deciding, it was all new to us. Sweeten and our contractors made us feel at ease,” he continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation had its challenges (the couple moved into a sublet for three months), but it wrapped up beautifully. “Before, there was a daily struggle for space and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>. Getting a certain level of cleanliness was never attainable in an older apartment. Now when we walk in the door, it’s a breath of fresh air,” Jonathan said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: The countertops are actually marble-like quartz that doesn’t just look pretty; it’s very durable too!</p>

			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Considering laminate wood flooring for your home? The benefits abound, from costs and style to durability</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="brown-laminate-wood-flooring" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide.jpg" alt="Brown laminate wood flooring with beige bench and side stool" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-51403 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With lumber prices skyrocketing, many homeowners are rethinking their material choices for renovations. One alternative to hardwood flooring, that deserves a second look, is laminate that looks like wood. Although lumber prices are starting to drop back to normal levels, Sweeten lays out what the benefits are beyond price alone to choosing laminate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is laminate flooring?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Lamination is a process of uniting layers of material by an adhesive (or other means.) Laminate wood flooring is just that–it is three material layers pressed together, using heat, to create a strong product. The base layer of laminate flooring is wood particleboard, followed by a layer with a wood image, known as the design layer. Over top is a protective transparent wear layer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It is easy to confuse laminate wood flooring with vinyl wood flooring. The main difference is their composition: laminate is 99% wood product, and vinyl wood flooring is all plastic.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Pros and cons of laminate wood flooring</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As with everything, there are tradeoffs when choosing one material over another. However, laminate flooring has a lot going for it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">Pros:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">Less expensive than hardwoods</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Durable: kid- and pet-friendly</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Comes in many styles and color options</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Is easy to install as a DIY project</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Can last from 10 to 25 years, depending on quality, care, and amount of use</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Generally eco-friendly: Made of post-consumer wood products; no need for glues or adhesives in installation; can be removed and re-used; can be recycled </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">Cons:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">Unlike solid hardwood flooring, laminate can’t be refinished when it begins to show signs of wear</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">It&#8217;s not 100% waterproof (not recommended for kitchens, bathrooms, or over cement slabs, as in basements)</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Difficult to repair</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Features of laminate wood flooring</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring has been around for more than 40 years. Over that time, manufacturers have improved on both the product’s performance and style. Today, there seem to be endless variations of the types of laminate available. Here are some of the features to keep in mind when choosing the right kind of laminate floors for your renovation.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Style and design</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Because laminate flooring is manufactured, the sky’s the limit on styles. With advances in technology, laminate wood flooring can very closely imitate the look and feel of real hardwoods. Today’s laminate includes grooves and ridges in the texture that create a natural-looking character. Boards come in all sizes: short, long, thin, or wide-plank. Want that hand-scraped wood look? No problem. Working on a coastal look? Laminate comes in gray and white-washed stains. You can choose your look by color variation, wood species, style theme, and size.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Underlayment</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring is installed as a floating floor. As a part of proper installation, a separate underlayment is required. The <a href="https://www.builddirect.com/learning-center/flooring/laminate-flooring-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s8">type of underlayment</span></a> varies depending on the subfloor. However, some laminate wood flooring products come with attached underlayment. In this case, a separate underlayment is not necessary. Pay attention when you buy as to whether or not your planks already come with or without this feature.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Waterproof</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">No laminate wood flooring is truly waterproof; for that, look to vinyl wood flooring. Despite this, you will see laminate wood flooring on the market, advertised as being waterproof. This tends to mean it is “spillproof.” Read the warranty closely. In the case where water gets under the flooring, either due to standing water under an appliance or installation over a previous cement slab, the wood material can still be damaged.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Noise resistance</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Some laminate manufacturers market features to reduce sound transmission underfoot. This can include attached backings, or the option to pair the flooring with a specific additional underlayment pad. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Use with radiant floor heating</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Radiant heating is a type of in-floor heating system that goes below the floor covering. Just as some solid wood species are better than others for use with radiant heating, the same goes for laminate. There are laminate wood flooring products designed for use with radiant heating. Discuss with your contractor what humidity levels you need to maintain to avoid gapping between the boards. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Durability rating</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring is known for being durable. Just how durable? Check <a href="https://www.builddirect.com/learning-center/flooring/laminate-flooring-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s8">its AC rating</span></a>. Short for Abrasion Criteria, the rating ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most durable. AC1 is suitable for low-traffic areas. For residential uses, AC3 or AC4 is generally advised for high-traffic rooms.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring cost vs. hardwood</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Obviously, solid hardwood flooring comes from planks milled from real trees. And that explains why, generally speaking, solid hardwood floors cost more than laminate flooring. The price is tied to factors such as weather, the rareness of wood, <span class="s8">and export costs</span>. Conversely, laminate wood flooring costs are based on its quality and style features: thickness; durability of wear layer; and presence of underlayment.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While laminate overall is less expensive than hardwoods, high-end laminate wood may cost more per square foot than low-end hardwoods. When choosing your laminate flooring, think about your durability needs, in addition to the other features we covered. (And, keep in mind, there are other variables to consider overall <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s9">when choosing a flooring material!)</span></a></span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much does hardwood flooring cost?</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/how-much-does-flooring-cost/"><span class="s9">Forbes</span></a>, hardwood flooring costs can average from $3–$12 a square foot. Add to that $26 (or higher) for 500 square feet of the required underlayment. Labor costs for hardwood flooring installation add an extra $3–$9 a square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The type of wood you choose affects the cost. <span class="s9">For example</span>, an exotic hardwood, like Brazilian walnut, can range from $8–$14 a square foot. A softer, more plentiful wood, such as pine, averages from $3–$6 a square foot. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Adding together materials and labor averages, total hardwood flooring costs can range between $6–$21 a square foot. For perspective, costs to install real hardwood flooring in a 500-square-foot area would be between $3,000–$10,500.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much does laminate flooring cost?</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s10">Most laminate flooring comes with an interlocking tongue-and-groove system. </span><span class="s1">Being a very DIY-friendly option, it’s helpful to focus on material costs alone. Laminate flooring can be purchased for as low as $0.59 a square foot, and can range upwards of $6 a square foot. Purchasing laminate with an attached underlayment will cost you more up-front, but will save on labor later.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s11">Breaking <span class="s12">this down further, laminate</span></span><span class="s2"> with a thin wear layer is available for as low as under $1 a square foot. Medium-quality laminate ranges from $2–$4, and high-quality sells for $3–$5+ a square foot.</span></p>
<h4>How much does it cost to install laminate wood flooring?</h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">If you’d rather have a pro install your laminate wood flooring, labor costs average between $1–$3 a square foot. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Altogether with materials and labor combined, laminate floors can cost as low as $1.59 and as high as $9 a square foot. That means it would cost between $795 and $4,500 to install laminate wood flooring in a 500-square-foot area.</span></p>
<h5>Choosing laminate floors for your home</h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The advances in laminate flooring technology over the past several decades have made a once-eschewed flooring material a strong contender to hardwoods. With its lower cost, durability, eco-friendliness, and wide range of style options, more people today are happily picking laminate hardwood flooring for their homes.</span></p>

			<h2 class="p1">Considering refinishing your wood floors? Ask yourself these questions—and know the alternatives</h2>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" title="white-living-room-with-blue-wall"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06.jpg" alt="White living room with blue hightlight wall and glass room divider" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51118" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Hardwood floors are like cats: they have many lives. Depending on the type—engineered or solid—<a href="https://homeguides.sfgate.com/number-times-hardwood-floor-can-refinished-87146.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">they can be re-sanded</span></a> and stained from one to ten times. Refinishing wood floors can last up to a decade if the floors are treated gently. With that in mind, it’s sensible to think through whether you should refinish your hardwood floors. Sweeten takes a look at how refinishing takes both money and time, but it can be worthwhile in the end.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Benefits to Refinishing Your Wood Floors</h3>
<p class="p1">There are many benefits to refinishing your hardwood floors. It may be obvious that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooring is a major component to any space</a>. It’s also one that is easily overlooked because floors serve as the backdrop to furnishings and decor. Especially if your home is older, addressing any nicks and stains in your wood floors can give it an updated and finished feel.</p>
<p class="p1">Second, newly refinished hardwood floors are beautiful. While that could be considered an opinion, it’s one that many people hold: according to Money.com, <a href="https://money.com/boost-home-value/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">hardwood floors can add 3-5%</span></a> to your home’s value.</p>
<p class="p1">Their longevity is a helpful perspective to keep in mind during the days or weeks it takes to have the work done. As the saying goes, it’s short-term pain for long term gain!</p>
<h3 class="p1">Evaluate the Condition of Your Floors</h3>
<p class="p1">If you’ve lived in your home for a long time or weren’t able to refinish the floors before moving in, you’ll want to be sure that refinishing is the right route. Moving all of your <span class="s2">earthly</span> possessions out and then back into the rooms that need attention is no walk in the park!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Evaluate the condition of your wood floors carefully.</p>
<p class="p1">Some items to consider are:</p>
<h4>Can the floors withstand another sanding?</h4>
<p class="p5">Solid hardwoods can be re-sanded more times than engineered hardwoods due to the thickness of the hardwood surface. Make sure there is enough wood remaining before proceeding (You can discuss this with your contractor).</p>
<h4>Are the floors damaged?</h4>
<p class="p5">If there are dark stains, missing chunks or gaps, or mismatched wood (perhaps from a previous repair), it may be time to refinish. Spot-matching wood stain is difficult; a full sanding and refinishing is the only way to ensure color consistency.</p>
<h4>Do the floorboards smell?</h4>
<p class="p5">Along with stains can come odors. Depending on the source and strength of the odor, a simple coat of polyurethane could lock the smell away. Pet urine stains are difficult to remove; in this case, a complete refinish may be your best bet at resolving it.</p>
<h4>Are there soft spots on the floor?</h4>
<p class="p5">A soft spot can indicate a thin or rotted subfloor. Old water damage, or pet urine that was allowed to sit too long, could be to blame. When patching damaged wood, there is a chance the subfloor may need to be replaced in that area as well.</p>
<p class="p1">Floors that need patching or repairing are good candidates for refinishing. It’s the smoothness, color consistency, and the final shine that really make finished floors pop. Consider these points when you reflect on how refinishing may improve the overall look and feel of your home.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Alternatives to Refinishing Hardwood Floors</h3>
<p class="p1">There are times when refinishing is not in the cards for homeowners. It might not fit in the budget, or they may not have the time or resources to remove furniture from every room with wood floors. There are some alternatives where you can enjoy your existing wood floors and push back the timeline on needing to do a complete refinishing.</p>
<h4 class="p8">Painting hardwood floors</h4>
<p class="p1">The least expensive, and likely most controversial, alternative to refinishing your hardwood floors is to paint them.</p>
<p><i>Pros</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Paint allows homeowners to get creative with patterns.</li>
<li>Painting may be more in-line with a homeowner’s style; not everyone loves the look of refinished hardwoods.</li>
<li>Painting is less expensive than refinishing.</li>
<li>This option can extend the life of wood floors that are too thin to be re-sanded.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Cons</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Paint may not last as long; be sure to choose a durable material.</li>
<li>This is a more controversial alternative, as some people feel that painting hardwoods ruins them. This is a personal preference.</li>
<li>Chipped paint may be easily noticed.</li>
<li>Sanding off paint is more difficult than sanding a floor with standard refinishing.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p8">Repairing hardwood floors</h4>
<p class="p1">When time and money are tight, repairing select areas of damaged wood could be a good short-term option.</p>
<p><i>Pros</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Repairing localizes the work, which could eliminate the need to move out all of your furniture.</li>
<li>Focusing on repairing now means that your floors will be ready when it comes time for a full refinish.</li>
<li>Replacing damaged wood can eliminate trip or splinter hazards, odors, and soft spots. This alone could make a room feel more comfortable.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Cons</i></p>
<ul>
<li>The color of the wood will not be consistent and the patching may be obvious.</li>
<li>Some contractors may prefer to do all the work at once, making it more difficult to find a contractor for this smaller job. However, it can be added onto a renovation you may already be having elsewhere in the home.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p8">Sealing hardwood floors</h4>
<p class="p1">This is a less expensive option that will help to protect your floors from further wear and tear. It skips the sanding and staining steps; simply add a coat of polyurethane.</p>
<p><i>Pros</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Skipping the sanding step means no dust!</li>
<li>Sealing will protect your floors for a few more years. If you are renting out the home, or want to wait to refinish until selling a home, this is a good option.</li>
<li>Sealing can help to reduce odor from pet stains.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Cons</i></p>
<ul>
<li>You will still need to remove all of your furniture so that floors can be sealed with a coat or two of polyurethane.</li>
<li>The smell of fresh polyurethane may take some time to dissipate.</li>
<li>You will need to seal again if you intend to refinish down the road; this essentially adds a cost to the total floor care.</li>
<li>Stains or gaps will still be visible since they were not sanded out or repaired.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">Questions to Ask Your Contractor</h3>
<p class="p1">Not all floor refinishing contractors are alike. They offer different levels of service, and some even use different equipment. When hiring a contractor for refinishing wood floors, ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>How will my rooms and furniture be protected? </i></li>
</ul>
<p class="p11">Sanding floors creates a substantial amount of dust. If you have rooms that won’t be emptied while work is being done, you’ll want to ask how those rooms will remain clean. Some contractors offer a dustless service. This means the contractor uses a sander with a vacuum that draws the dust out of the home during the sanding process. While “dustless” is not 100% dust-free, it will significantly cut down the mess you will need to clean up after the job is finished. If they don’t offer dustless sanding, ask if the contractor will seal off rooms that won’t need sanding with plastic or canvas drop cloths.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><i>Be aware of the timeline.</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="p11">If you are repairing or adding additional wood flooring, be aware that wood boards need to acclimate to your home’s temperature and humidity before being installed. Also, you will not have access to walk on your floors while the stain and varnish is drying, and you may want to air out the house from their smell. Ask how long each of these items will add to the timeline.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><i>Cost considerations</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="p11">Some contractors have an average price per square foot they will quote. If you have areas that need additional attention (squeaks, soft spots, staining), ask how much addressing those issues will add to the total cost.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><i>Flooring transitions</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="p11">In instances where new wood will meet with old, discuss with your contractor how the transition between new and old wood will happen. This could include areas that need patching, or where an adjacent room’s flooring is replaced with hardwoods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ask if they will match the wood type and size, or if they can make the transition look seamless.</p>
<h4>Deciding to refinish hardwood floors</h4>
<p class="p1">There is a lot to consider when it comes to refinishing hardwood floors. Do your research, and get quotes from multiple contractors who specialize in it. Ask questions<span>—and make sure you understand all options at your disposal.</span> In the end, that’s the best way to be confident in knowing whether refinishing your hardwood floors is right for your home.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural, versatile, timeless&#8230;wood floors can last for decades or even generations. But if there&#8217;s damage after years of wear, or the stain just isn&#8217;t suited to your style, replacing them may be your best bet for safer and better-looking floors. Ahead, we share five reasons Sweeten homeowners decided to replace hardwood floors and revitalize their spaces.</span></p>

<h3>Improving the overall home design</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35230" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-07.jpg" alt="home renovation, living room renovation, open floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-07-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With low ceilings at just a little over eight feet high, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maggie and Adam worked to create an illusion</a> of a taller height. A ceiling plan for each room was planned out by the couple. This included narrow interior doors, white walls, colorful art, and 7-inch wide hickory flooring throughout.</span></p>
<h3>Adding soundproofing to floors</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36986 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08.jpg" alt="Murray Hill living room renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>When Christina decided to renovate her studio co-op in Murray Hill, the building requested that she <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/alcove-studio-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">install a layer of soundproofing</a>. Even if soundproofing isn’t mandated, it can add a layer of ease and “acoustic comfort” to your space. And, Christina pointed out that the installation process isn’t as bad as you might think. About replacing her floors, she said: “the entire removal and installation was surprisingly a relatively fast process.”</p>
<h3>Repairing subfloor water damage</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35603 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17.jpg" alt="This homeowner replaced water-damage flooring for light, wooden oak floorboards" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-17-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
In Sherry&#8217;s midtown apartment, the wood floors <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/millennial-apartment-renovation-midtown-east/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suffered from water damage</a>.  A previous tenant had left the windows open for weeks when Sherry&#8217;s family rented the apartment out. When she was ready to move into the space, she changed out the damaged floorboards for sleek, new oak wide-paneled wood flooring.</p>
<h3>Replacing uneven (and noisy) hardwood floors</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38259 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792.jpg" alt="Warm red oak wooden floors replace the once uneven, creaky wood flooring in this city apartment" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5792-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />When Katie and Marcus&#8217; bought their apartment, they knew they&#8217;d have to replace the noisy and uneven wood floors. Their contractor started to rip open the floorboards, only to find there was no subfloor. He worked to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/replacing-wood-floors-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add in new subflooring and soundproofing</a> and replace the floors. They decided on a warm red oak that complements the exposed brick fireplace.</p>
<h3>Reflecting more natural light</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37459 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a.jpg" alt="Replacing wood floors with a lighter stained wood adds a light and airy vibe to this Manhattan space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Sometimes, the best reason to make a change is the simplest: because you want to. A Manhattan couple decided <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/kips-bay-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replacing wood floors with a lighter finish</a> would give their space a brighter look. Their designer helped refresh their space by painting the walls a warmer white hue and by adding translucent drapes to let in more natural light.</p>

<h3>Before: Renovate an outdated Brooklyn kitchen</h3>
<p>Longtime renters Marc and Steve dreamed of having a place of their own. Their search for a one-bedroom in Brooklyn eventually led them to an unexpected choice: a co-op or house? The townhouse, they discovered, was a short commute (only two express train stops) from Manhattan. It would provide more space than a one-bedroom apartment and not have the maintenance fees that go with living in a co-op. After purchasing their new home, they lived in it for seven months before turning their attention to the kitchen.</p>
<p>“It was perhaps the most outdated room and we knew it needed a major renovation,” Marc said. The existing cabinets were grimy and had broken doors. Some were so high up that they were almost unusable. The countertops had seen better days. The too-big appliances—combined with a low drop ceiling—made it feel like the walls were closing in on the already small space.</p>

<h3>After: Creating the &#8220;must-haves&#8221; list and choosing the contractor</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a list of must-haves that included a full-size dishwasher and additional storage space, Marc and Steve set out to plan a renovation. “Before Sweeten, we weren&#8217;t sure how to find a contractor we could trust,” Marc said. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Posting his project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> led him to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his general contractor</a>. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After reading through great reviews and discussing the contractor&#8217;s past work with Sweeten, he felt confident he was making the right choice and accepted his contractor&#8217;s bid.</p>
<p><a href="http://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46407" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png" alt="Get Matched With Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fans of the classic, black-and-white New York kitchen, the couple aimed to create a bright space with a clean look, layering plenty of white to make the space feel bigger. “The kitchen needed to be truly functional and not just pretty,” Marc said. As for the design, “we landed on something like ‘a traditional white kitchen goes modern.&#8217;” With a contractor on board, they were finally on their way to the modern black and white kitchen renovation of their dreams.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48203 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Marc-Floor-1.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>Planning and ordering kitchen cabinets</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The need to demo the entire space meant that measuring would have to wait and the new cabinets—which usually require some lead time—couldn’t be ordered before work began. The couple decided on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA cabinets</a> and Semihandmade doors because they would arrive sooner than a fully customized set (although Marc noted that the cabinet door delivery took longer than planned). He also mentioned taking advantage of running the cabinets from top to bottom on two walls to get as much storage as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With cabinets of varying sizes, they chose flat-panel doors to streamline the look rather than the Shaker-style that was initially under consideration. The couple opted for full-size appliances (they got their dishwasher!) since they cook and bake on a daily basis, while a counter-depth fridge was installed to save some space and make room for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry cabinet</a>. For unity between the backsplash and countertop, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble-looking quartz</a> was selected for both surfaces. To let in more light, their contractor also widened the window over the sink to give a clear view of the garden.</p>

<h3>Marc + Steve&#8217;s renovation tips</h3>
<p>Overall, the renovation took closer to three months—“a month or so longer than we hoped,” Marc shared. “But it was worth it!” While waiting on cabinet doors, his contractor tackled smaller projects, adding new baseboards and trim to the main living area, hanging pendants over the dining table, and removing the drop ceiling that continued throughout the rest of the ground floor. Marc tells us that working with his contractor was a great experience. “We are perfectionists, so we&#8217;d come home to see the work done each day and have a bunch of questions. He always answered patiently and quickly, or fixed things as soon as he could.”</p>
<p><strong>The couple&#8217;s advice to future renovators:</strong> “Check return policies on everything. We ordered a range hood online that wasn&#8217;t what we thought it was. They wouldn’t let us return it because you have to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reject it immediately at delivery</a>.” Another tip: Dust is going to get everywhere, even with a contractor who&#8217;s careful, so be prepared for some <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/clean-up-after-major-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clean-up after the work</a> is done.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34326" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Marc-Kitchen.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="816" height="1224" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />Why they love their new Sweeten kitchen</h3>
<p>The new space feels light and airy—and much bigger than before. “We can both stand in the kitchen at the same time and it&#8217;s not overly crowded,&#8221; Marc said. &#8220;Design-wise, it&#8217;s the kitchen we always wanted and I don&#8217;t think we have any regrets about the choices we made (and there were so many choices!).”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Marc and Steve were most excited for the new kitchen floor and the “wow” moment they achieved with patterned black-and-white tile.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Marc and Steve, for sharing your modern black and white kitchen renovation with us! </em></p>

<p>Often on the wish-list, islands are the perfect kitchen workhorse but don&#8217;t need to look so hard-working. The waterfall style gives this piece of furniture a finishing touch. From wood to concrete, here are seven ideas to pore over.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A couple&#8217;s optimism yields a washer-and-dryer—and more—in Brooklyn</h2>
<p><em>Who wants to schlep laundry up and down five flights of stairs? That’s what motivated Lynn, Craig, and their pooch Pistol to renovate their first home, a 1,200-square-foot Prospect Heights co-op. But not so fast. First, they couldn’t find a contractor willing to take on the job of remodeling two tiny bathrooms. Then they couldn’t get one on board for a washer-and-dryer install. They eventually turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, where they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> and were matched with a vetted general contractor not only </em>willing,<em> but excited, to take on the job. All this while the clock was ticking on their move-in date.</em></p>

<p>After living in rentals forever—from 300-square-foot studios to windowless apartments— we were ready to buy something of our own. When Lynn co-founded her business—Dome, a multidisciplinary design studio—in 2014, we casually began to look for a place where she could work from home.</p>
<p>For two years, we visited open houses to learn about the Brooklyn housing market. Many of the homes felt oddly chopped up, hastily constructed, overpriced, or were projects too intimidating for us to tackle for our first home purchase. We wanted a space that felt open and bright, where we wouldn’t hit the walls within a year, and that was in a welcoming neighborhood.</p>

<p>When we found this two-bedroom, 1.5 bath co-op in a circa 1930s Prospect Heights building close to express subways, our friends, Prospect Park’s off-leash area, and saw it had lots of space and light, we immediately put in a bid. We thought we had a chance, given it was a steep fifth-floor walk-up—a deterrent for many buyers in a competitive market. We ended up losing the bid, only to have the owner come back to us weeks later offering us the home after the first deal fell through. Our move-in date was two months later, in mid-September.</p>
<p>We started out just wanting a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laundry hook-up</a> in the half-bath. We’d spent years hauling bags to coin laundromats and felt a washer-and-dryer were non-negotiable. But once we started thinking things through, our small project ballooned. We soon realized that both bathrooms needed to be gutted. The full bath had no storage and was on a 10-inch platform to accommodate mid-century plumbing. The half-bath was previously used as a cat’s bathroom, accompanied by a pet door—and a significant odor.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34613 mb-0 size-full" title="gray-living-room-rug-under-chairs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-13.jpg" alt="gray living room with rug under chairs and gray couch and long double hung window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-13-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Sweeten project post</a>, titled “Make These Bathrooms My Favorite Rooms” captured our optimism to transform these small, dismal rooms into a smarter space for our lifestyle and aesthetic taste. So, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose our Sweeten contractor</a>. We didn’t expand either footprint, but were strategic about how each element would really be used, cleaned, and look next to each other.</p>
<p>Overall, we replaced four bathroom and closet doors made of tired, hollow-core faux wood with solid-slab, single-panel Shaker doors. The dark wood floors in the rest of the apartment ground the space and the white walls reflect light. The high-contrast gave us a great foundation for our furniture, textiles, and plants.</p>

<p>We also saw a great opportunity to demo the dining room and envisioned a “great room” with flow between the kitchen, dining, and living rooms where we could host gatherings. After living in claustrophobic rentals, we wanted the first impression to be of openness and light.</p>
<p>Lynn’s background in exhibit design allowed us to renovate without an architect. We measured each wall’s dimension and built a model of the home in <a href="https://www.sketchup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SketchUp</a>. We could quickly see how to scale any fixtures or make changes. And, the model helped us discuss in more detail with contractors, such as rear-outlet toilets, fixture finishes, grout types, and bath fan sone ratings (for loudness).</p>

<p>The dining room walls were not load-bearing, and there are always surprises when you start opening up floors and walls. When our Sweeten contractor demo’d the dining room walls, he found charred beams in the ceiling from a long-ago fire. We had no idea there had been damage. He reinforced the ceiling with new wood to ensure structural stability.</p>

<p>In the full bathroom, which is 35 square feet, we weren’t sure if we’d be able to drop it down 10 inches. Before we had even hired our contractor, he took out his chisel and broke a peephole into the floor to see what was possible. He gave us confidence that we could make it work, ultimately dropping the entire bathroom, keeping the bathtub at the elevated height, and building out a wall for our new sink and cabinet fixtures.</p>

<p>We included so many details in this bathroom that make all the difference on a day-to-day basis, including a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighted</a> medicine cabinet with outlets inside to allow us to charge our toothbrushes out-of-sight, thereby removing clutter; the near-silent bathroom fan serves as the main light and is hidden without a vent cover; and a wall-hung sink and cabinet allows for more storage and easier cleaning underneath.</p>

<p>As for the half-bath—only 24 square feet—several contractors, who initially inspected the job advised us to forego the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer-and-dryer</a> altogether, saying it was impossible, or that we had to tap into our toilet line and disrupt the apartment below. Our Sweeten contractor&#8217;s plumbing team found a simpler solution by tapping into the small sink&#8217;s line. We got a compact, ventless Bosch washer-and-dryer to accommodate the water line, electrical load, and tight space in the bath. Remodeling this room has been a life-changer.</p>
<p>The other issue in this space was the overwhelming odor of cat urine. We tried every odor-reducing spray and paint on the market, and used black lights to expose urination spots, but in the end, we had our contractor gut the walls and floor down to the slab to remove the contaminated wood. Every visit during the renovation had our contractor sniffing in corners, trying to find new origins of contamination. Thankfully, it does not smell like cat pee anymore. We also replaced the dated fixtures in that bath with the smallest toilet and sink we could find.</p>

<p>Overall, everything went pretty smoothly. Our biggest challenge, really, had been finding a contractor. But Sweeten gave us three leads, and our contractor came to the first meeting as if he already had the job, giving realistic explanations for what it would take to accomplish the work. During the renovation, he rarely said no or told us a change wasn&#8217;t possible. As we added to our original scope, he was incredibly flexible and adjusted his timeline and the work to hit our mid-September move-in date. He gave us recommendations when we didn’t know what to buy, explained to us what was needed, and helped us quickly to complete the work.</p>

<p>Sweeten helped us, too, by getting us to clarify our scope and put a realistic budget into our initial post. We learned that even though our timeline was compressed, renovating a home is practically a second job if you undertake it on your own with just a contractor. We now understand why people hire architects. For those with less design experience or who are strapped for time, it would be helpful to work with a professional who can do the groundwork for you.</p>

<p>Another piece of advice is if you can do a major renovation before moving in, bite the bullet and get it done. Don’t put off with cleaning the dust later on. We plan to continue renovating in phases, but wanted to get the most disruptive work completed before moving in.</p>
<p>Having gone through four rentals in six years, we always struggled to feel at home. Our new space is beautiful and feels like something we can make our own. We enjoy inviting others into it as often as possible.</p>

			<h2>From wide-plank to herringbone, these popular hardwood floor patterns spice up any home</h2>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten renovation by Shana Sandberg of </span><a href="https://www.revelcraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #76808f;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel Craft and Design</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The popularity of using hardwood for flooring in homes dates back hundreds of years. Up to today, the material has proven to remain steadfast through time and trends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you choose geometric shapes like herringbone or chevron, or wide plank versus classic width, it anchors the whole home. Typically installed throughout, wood floors cover a large square footage. It has a substantial impact on your home&#8217;s personality and design style. No surprise, then, the perennial wood floor is often chosen for its unifying qualities and timelessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, Sweeten renovators show how their hardwood floor ideas added to their home overall. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches residential renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering know-how, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection—for free.</span></p>
<h3>A herringbone wood floor in Crown Heights</h3>

Plus, it serves as a place to stay when they work late in the city. They updated the townhouse, keeping the small fourth floor as their own. For their one-bedroom unit, the goal was to create an open, airy studio. One of their pressing challenges was the hardwood floors. They were covered by old vinyl and carpeting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">They chose white-oak flooring that would be custom laid in a herringbone pattern. Unfortunately, the lead time was two months just to get the wood custom cut. So, they adjusted their plans and found a pre-cut herringbone wood floor that could be installed quickly. Their quick fix became a beautiful solution.</span></p>
<h3>Herringbone pattern wood enriches a kitchen</h3>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Nazli and Larry<a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/"><span class="s2">, updating their historic Brooklyn brownstone</span></a> was a labor of love. They wanted to merge modern and traditional styles. The challenge wa</span><span class="s1">s how to do so within the townhouse’s long and narrow dimensions. The couple also struggled between managing their budget and getting their absolute must-haves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, some things Nazli wouldn’t compromise on. One was the wood floors. They wanted to make a statement in the kitchen so they splurged on walnut and installed it as a herringbone pattern. It gives the kitchen a rich, finished look, which extends into the parlor. To stay within budget, they used a less expensive white oak for the upstairs—an area that sees much less traffic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pro tip: There are a variety of wood floor species—all at varying price points. Oak, maple, and cherry are popular choices as well as bamboo, walnut, ash, and mahogany. Shop around to find the one that fits your budget and style.  </span></p>
<h3>Wide-plank wood flooring</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47439" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these Sweeten renovators, redoing </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their Greenwich Village condo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included gutting the place and adding a second bedroom. The plan was to maximize their 16-foot ceilings to make the 850-square-foot space larger and more modern. They turned it into a gallery-like space with black steel accents contrasting bright white walls. They kept the finishes simple giving an airiness to the space. One major design detail that achieves this is the contemporary-looking wide-plank wood flooring in a neutral stain. The home became more open, expansive, and refreshed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro tip: By definition, a wide plank is wider than today’s standard 2½– to 4–inch boards. And they are believed by many to increase property value due to their current popularity and relatively expensive price.</span></p>
<h3>Wide plank flooring in white oak</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49428" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working from home was the reason for moving into their 1950s home in Los Angeles. Like a lot of people who found they needed a home office during the pandemic, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy and Kevin needed a larger space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So the 1,538-square-foot house was perfect even if it was in need of a little TLC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They hired a Sweeten contractor to fix up the living room, kitchen, and bathrooms. But first things first. They started by laying down new flooring throughout the house. “We chose white-oak engineered hardwood in 8-inch planks to showcase the oak’s natural grain and make the house’s interior feel cohesive,” says Amy. And a bonus: The lighter floors compliment the living room’s natural wood ceiling.</span></p>
<h3>Classic wood floors in a Westchester County compound</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03.jpg" alt="living room with hardwood floors large windows and fireplace and track lights after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51202" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shana Sandberg of </span><a href="https://www.revelcraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel Craft and Design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came to Sweeten to help </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-westchester-county-home-remodel-turns-into-a-top-notch-family-compound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renovate her client’s home in Harrison, New York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The homeowners wanted to turn the 1953 estate into a convenient, multi-generational gathering spot for their family. The home needed an overhaul of the kitchen and bathrooms. The renovation plans also called for a new 750-square-foot addition to act as a large family room. The look of the home is contemporary classic brought together by the beautiful white-oak classic wood floors seen throughout. The homeowners chose variegated coloring to create a sense of refreshed modernity with a nod to the classic.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro tip: Variegated wood coloring and mixed-width patterns add versatility and work well with both classic and contemporary designs.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Clinton Hill home gains flexible space with sliding doors</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33864 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, open shelving, bar" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two decades ago, native New Yorkers Margery and Jim Fields worked in Manhattan and lived just outside the city. In 1996, the family relocated to Philadelphia when Jim was transferred for a job. The couple always had a special place in their hearts for New York, and when their kids grew up, they decided it was the right time to return.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33866 size-chrono" title="Margery and Jim" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-16-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NYC-Skyline.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34597 size-chrono" title="view" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NYC-Skyline-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34566 size-chrono" title="floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Floorplan-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they began their search for an NYC home, they wanted something a bit unique. They looked at many listings, but it was the view from their apartment at the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a> (a Brooklyn complex near and dear to us here at Sweeten, after renovating so many homes there!) that sold them on the one-bedroom place they ended up purchasing. They loved the sweeping view of Manhattan—the island that drew them back to the five boroughs.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33868 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-04-723x933.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33875 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-07-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33867 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, subway tile, spot lighting, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment itself was a different story. It hadn’t been updated in 40 years and had been chopped up with too many walls. Despite this, they decided that the incredible views were worth the trade-off of having to renovate. After a remodeling of their Philadelphia kitchen several years ago, they had a good idea of a wishlist for their next project. They wisely decided to live in the space for six months before starting the design process to get a feel for how they would use it—and to understand the light&#8217;s effect in the apartment at various times of the day. They heard about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, from their neighbors, and it kept coming up in conversation. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose this Sweeten contractor</a>, who had previously done several projects in the Clinton Hill Co-ops.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34564 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-05-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33869 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-05a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34108 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-05a-723x484.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, subway tile, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="484" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once discussions got underway, they made some decisions with the help of their Sweeten contractor; prior work in the building meant he knew what was behind the walls and what to anticipate, so was able to guide Margery and Jim on what actions would need to come next in the process. He knew the bathroom ceiling was a drop ceiling and would be able to install the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotlighting</a> they wanted. Their contractor was also familiar with the building&#8217;s wiring and informed them it would not support an induction cooktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple’s design vision was an industrial-yet-modern aesthetic. They wanted to take down the walls boxing in the kitchen and allow as much light into the space as possible. The full scope included a new kitchen and bath as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33873 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-04-723x933.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33872 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, hardwood floors, sliding door, french door, open shelving, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, Margery and Jim planned to convert the dining nook beside the kitchen into a second bedroom but ultimately decided on a flex-space solution made possible by sliding doors. When they didn’t need the second bedroom, the doors could remain open to take full advantage of the two large windows in the nook. The contractor created a custom solution by fusing two estate-sale-find French doors that Margery and Jim had found to make a sliding pocket door. The renovated nook is now a seating area that can be closed off from the living room to create a guest sleeping area that feels like a “studio within the apartment,” explained Margery. It is also a cozy spot for guests to perch when the pair entertain and are preparing food in the kitchen. (Given that Jim has seven brothers who are all married, they definitely need the seating for guests!)</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-03.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33876 mb-0 size-chrono" title="long-blue-kitchen-cabinet-peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-03.gif" alt="long blue kitchen cabinet with knob and white kitchen peninsula with cabinets after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the kitchen revamp, Jim and Margery decided on dark gray cabinets paired with a light quartz countertop and glass subway tile. The contractor suggested a full-length <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pantry</a> next to the refrigerator on the wall separating the kitchen from the living room, providing unexpected bonus storage. On the other side of the fridge, open shelving is built onto a mirrored backsplash for maximum light reflection into the kitchen. Corner shelving was added, with a Lazy Susan to maximize under-counter space leaving enough room for a full-size dishwasher.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33877 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, hardwood floors, subway tile, stainless steel appliances, sliding door, spot lighting" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-14.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33878 mb-0 size-chrono" title="gray-blue-kitchen-cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-14.gif" alt="gray blue kitchen cabinet with oven and a white door after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple intended to add a kitchen island at first. But when they saw how open the space felt without it, they chose to leave it as is. Similarly, the original design called for stainless steel shelving to be added to the back wall above the sink but decided to leave it open for an airier feel overhead.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33882 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-06-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33881 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33879 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, bathroom, large-format tiles, vinyl tub, bronze penny floor tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Margery and Jim were able to make use of another estate sale find—the black large-format tiles, which cost a dollar a piece. They paired those tiles with an unusual bronze <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penny tile</a> Margery had once seen and admired in a restaurant. A cast-iron tub was swapped out for a vinyl one that allowed the contractor to bring the wall tile around the front to tie the space together. Modern Brizo fixtures helped to finish the clean, streamlined look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that their project is complete, Margery and Jim have a few words of wisdom for would-be renovators. They stress the importance of selecting the right contractor—one with whom you can have a good “communication cadence,” said Margery. “We would text or talk to our contractor multiple times a week, or multiple times a day as things came up. That ability to instantly communicate would keep things from being delayed or misinterpreted.” They love the openness of the new layout, &#8220;while keeping some separation between the kitchen and main living space,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;We&#8217;re glad we didn&#8217;t take out the bar/pantry wall.&#8221; Check out their Behind-The-Reno video below:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When the deal fell through on a new, larger apartment, Zoe and Arvid decided to stay put in their Lincoln Square building in Manhattan and make their 700-square-foot one-bedroom work. But two years later, the cramped space won out, and they went on the hunt for a new home. Zoe, who admits to an unhealthy relationship with HGTV, dreamt of buying, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combining</a>, and renovating an adjoining apartment. They decided to send letters to their adjacent neighbors and, to their surprise, one was looking to move, so they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a contractor.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What Zoe, who works in finance, and Arvid, a 3-D designer, wanted most was extra space where they could spread out and finally be able to sit down at a proper dining table instead of crouching over the coffee table. For style, the couple would need to compromise. Zoe liked mid-century modern and rustic looks while Arvid preferred clean, modern lines with a dash of industrial.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor they chose</a> to combine their apartments set out to remove the two existing kitchens, rip out old parquet-glued-to-concrete floors, and demo some internal walls to create a third bedroom. They moved into a sublet during much of the work.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33713 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before02-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33690 size-chrono" title="brown-vinyl-floor-white-room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30.jpg" alt="brown vinyl floor in a white living room with blue wall after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-33.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33693 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-33.gif" alt="renovation, apartment combination, accent wall, hardwood floors, hidden storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few “must-haves” as the couple thought through the design. Since they’re a “<span style="color: #333333;">shoes-off household,</span>” said Zoe, they needed a storage solution near the entrance. The answer, literally, was hidden in a structural column close to where they broke through the two apartments. At first, the duo tossed around ideas about how to make the column “purposeful.” Their ideas ranged from a gas fireplace to a wine fridge. Instead, they chose &#8220;practical,&#8221; she said, and created a hidden shoe closet. “Our contractor really worked with us on hardware—concealed hinges and push-open latch—and hand-sawed the baseboard to get a wider angle for the slide-out racks,” she explained. The shoe slide-out from Elfa fit the space, and to give it a sense of design, it was painted a deep accent color for some contrast and to hide dirt on the push-open door.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When they opened the wall that would be the spot for the<span style="color: #333333;"> dining room</span>, the mood dampened for a moment when they found an unmovable gas riser. “We decided to make lemonade out of this,” said Zoe and thought about how to turn it into a design element. They settled on a “partition” type of structure that took the least amount of space while letting the light through. They found Blacktable Studio to walk them through the process. As a 3-D designer, Arvid took the lead on this fun project, creating the designs and submitting his sketches. The panels were delivered two weeks later. “Our contractor carefully installed the panel and adjusted the baseboard to make a seamless connection. This graphic panel is now a nice focal point that adds a lot of character,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-25.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33707 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-25-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, dining room, edison lighting, wood table" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They also liked the idea of having an extendable table for extra guests. “We never had a proper dining area before, so the prospect of having one definitely prompted a lot of imaginary dinner parties,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33709 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before01-723x933.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33696 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-01-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, kitchen, hardwood floors, bar seating" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33697 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, kitchen, backsplash tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33698 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-24-723x1067.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, hidden storage, accent wall" width="723" height="1067" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33706 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-22-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, backsplash tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the couple’s time was spent looking for <span style="color: #333333;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a></span> because it was the most prominent backdrop in the apartment and would set the tone for everything else. They wanted wide 7” to 8&#8243; European-style planks that were not too light or too dark. Arvid spent a lot of time finding the right hue, saturation, and wood grain. “It turned into a bit of an obsessive pursuit and we finally agreed on a natural color that&#8217;s very rustic with knots and saw marks. It&#8217;s a bit of a risk, but most people seem to love it,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-34.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33719 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-34-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, living room" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the living room, there was an AC/radiator below the window. More than 50 years of painting had “made it a big sad mess,” Zoe said. They wanted to cover it and also make it functional. Their Sweeten contractor listened to their input, and, she said, “we just designed it on the fly. One weekend Arvid used leftover black sample paint to paint over the heating elements behind the built-in.” This created more contrast against the outside white paint. Now the built-in&#8217;s horizontal slats look crisper, and you can barely see the mechanical elements behind it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other detail they focused on was smart light switches. The commonly available ones didn’t look good and the modern looking ones were way out of their budget. They took a chance on Noon Home, a start-up company selling ones around $100. “We couldn’t be happier,” she said. “The product looks modern and the app works great.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33701 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-16-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, bedroom, accent wall, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-32.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33702 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-wall-white-glass-door" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-32.gif" alt="blue wall and a white glass door and light brown floor after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To compromise their style preferences, they invented a design hybrid they called “Scandinavian mid-century” with a lot of black and white and plenty of geometric shapes. They learned the importance of taking time to plan a renovation. “Do a lot of showrooming and Pinteresting; both help you to know what you like,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33714 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before04-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33700 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, bathroom, chevron tile, glass shower door" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Once the work starts, there is little time to decide,&#8221; Zoe said. &#8220;Measure everything and live the design in your head. Know how many linear feet of closet you need and where you might store the vacuum cleaner. This is especially helpful for the kitchen design.” Zoe measured the maximum size of her pots and condiments and knew the drawer heights she needed. The only shortfall of planning too well is that you might become too attached to certain choices. She suggests being prepared for changes and understand that sometimes, you’ll have to go with the second choice.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of some permit delays, the apartment was not ready for move-in after their sublet ended. For three weeks, they began an Airbnb-hopping adventure. “It&#8217;s a lot of stress, but we discovered different neighborhoods and lifestyles. We now know for sure commuting to New Jersey is not meant for us,” Zoe said. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living on-site</a> for the second half of the project was a big challenge and meant being around a lot of dust and living out of suitcases. Now that it’s completed, she said their new home makes them feel “happy!”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When Vitoria, an art historian, and Jonathan, a location scout, purchased their 650-square-foot co-op in a century-old building in South Williamsburg, they began discussing renovations right away. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22955#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches homeowners with vetted general contractors, and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4378" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with a Sweeten contractor</a> to create a new home for the couple, daughter Asa, and Ramona, the family dog.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-04-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33753 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-04-1-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33563 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-08-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, living room, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment was in &#8220;okay&#8221; shape, but it had little storage and the materials used were poor quality—laminate flooring and old Ikea cabinets. It would need a lot of updates along with better quality materials, such as kitchen countertops and new hardwood floors, but they were limited on budget and time. Some of their efforts went into looking ahead toward selling in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vitoria, who is inspired by the simplicity of Japanese design, envisioned uncluttered white space with lots of natural wood color. “Since we are growing a family in a small space, a place that looks tidy and serene was a priority. For us ‘negative space’ is actually positive,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33565 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-10-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, living room, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33564 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-09-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, living room, hardwood floors, natural wood" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>We replaced the cheap laminate with thick hardwood [so] the unevenness is barely noticeable.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">Once the demo began, they were faced with a few surprises including rotten pipes in the kitchen sink and toilet and uneven floors. </span>Changing the floor was imperative. Vitoria said she had some “crazy ideas” to put in cork floors or use raw plywood cabinets in the kitchen, but then realized those materials would not increase the resale value and were too specific to her own personal taste. They opted instead for a pre-finished <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oak hardwood</a> which their contractor suggested. She admitted she was scared at first since the color of the boards varied quite a lot, but she soon fell in love. “The wood floor has so much personality!” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33754 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33567 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, hardwood floors, white cabinets, quartz countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33566 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-03-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, white cabinets, quartz countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While redoing the subfloor in the bathroom, they decided not to renovate all the subflooring throughout the rest of the apartment to save time and money, &#8220;Since we replaced the cheap laminate with thick hardwood,&#8221; Vitoria said. &#8220;the unevenness is barely noticeable.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their Sweeten contractor helped with the layout of the kitchen, fitting in more storage with cabinets that were taller and deeper. They kept the stove and washer-and-dryer in the kitchen and purchased a new refrigerator. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrow cabinet for their spices</a> flanks the hood.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33568 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-02-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, hardwood floors, quartz countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33569 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, white cabinets, quartz countertop" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few &#8220;must-haves&#8221; on the couple&#8217;s list; in fact, Vitoria chose a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quartz countertop</a> before she even chose a contractor. “Quartz is a great material, especially for clumsy cooks like me,” she said. She also insisted on a Toto toilet and a slim Blomberg refrigerator. “These were non-negotiable. I had to have them!” Since the remodel, Vitoria said, “I actually have more space in the cabinets than I have things to put in them.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She also loved the idea of untreated pine for the open shelves above the sink to store what she called their “showpieces.&#8221; While visitors may think it’s yet to be painted, she is happy with the result.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33571 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-01-723x1084.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg" width="723" height="1084" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33572 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, hexagon floor tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They had a good working relationship with their contractor, who not only had a great personality but sourced materials that fit their taste and worked for resale while being adept at managing their budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When their contractor took up the bathroom floor, he discovered the original 100-year-old tiles, which were cracked and loose. He had to remove two layers of tile and redo the subfloor, which delayed the project by a couple of days. &#8220;Throughout the whole process, he was very aware that we had no wiggle room in the budget and was super cost-conscious. We are extremely grateful for that,&#8221; said Vitoria.</p>
<p>During the chaotic periods, they were glad to have Sweeten in their corner. Vitoria liked that Sweeten contacted her often during the renovation, commenting that it made her feel well taken care of and gave her peace of mind.</p>
<p>Post-renovation, Vitoria knows that there will always be unexpected issues no matter how good your contractor is or how fat your budget. “But having a home that you love makes it worth every penny spent,” she said. “Although my home is small, it feels spacious. I confess I only leave if I have to.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tara and Ryan turn an industrial space into a warm family home</h2>
<p><em>Tara, a former teacher-turned-homemaker, and Ryan, a software developer, had always loved the 1800s cast-iron buildings in the SoHo district of NYC. When the couple, who now have a 19-month-old son, had a chance a few years ago to buy into the neighborhood, they jumped at it.

<p><em>Tara, a former teacher-turned-homemaker, and Ryan, a software developer, had always loved the 1800s cast-iron buildings in the SoHo district of NYC. When the couple, who now have a 19-month-old son, had a chance a few years ago to buy into the neighborhood, they jumped at it. Despite the architectural details within their newly purchased loft, the space was outdated and a partial wall was used to create the only bedroom in the home. Here’s the story of how Tara and Ryan <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a> to renovate their 1,200-square-foot co-op apartment.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2012, we had the opportunity to buy a loft in a former silk importer warehouse and fell in love with the possibilities. The space showcased several classic neighborhood features, such as cast-iron Corinthian columns, 13-foot tin ceilings, oversized windows, and exposed brick walls. However, it also needed a lot of work. The kitchen and bathroom were dated. The bamboo flooring was uneven. There was no storage and the only bedroom had a divider instead of a full wall. We lived in the space for a few years while we considered our options. Then we got pregnant with our son, Wyatt, so we decided to act fast to make room for our new family addition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our renovation vision was to embrace the original loft aesthetic with an industrial-meets-modern design. We wanted to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-homes-discover-the-raw-appeal-of-exposed-brick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-expose the brick</a> along the entire length of the living room wall. It was a similar case in the master bedroom, where we wanted to add an accent wall. The columns and original tin ceiling would be left untouched; we loved their rustic, industrial character. That raw look would contrast with the clean, modern, and white gloss cabinetry in the kitchen and living room built-ins that we wanted. The brands we chose were based on quality, modern aesthetic, and resale value.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We were unsure of what to expect when the brick in the living room would be exposed. In addition to finding a few more steam, electrical, and drain pipes than expected, we also uncovered a square archway (the brick wall was a firewall running down the center beam of the building and the arch was a former large doorway from its time as a warehouse). During the co-op conversion, these archways were covered by standard framing and wallboard to separate the apartments. However, the feature was aesthetically unpleasing. We solved the problem by covering the drywall and turning it into a “feature wall” with reclaimed barn siding. Finally, we showcased the wall with down-lit recessed lighting—an idea we got from a movie. To keep the décor minimalistic, we made maximum use of our new storage. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> along much of the living room wall are compartmentalized for baby toys, books, media, and our vinyl collection. On the opposite wall sits a desk for paperwork and musical inspiration; Ryan has played the guitar since he was 13 and hopes his son, Wyatt, inherits his passion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the kitchen, we essentially kept the same layout. We had looked at several floor plan options that would have potentially altered the kitchen/bathroom layout and location. After exploring those options, we realized moving those “wet” spaces over our downstairs neighbor’s “dry” living room would drastically increase the cost and complexity of our project. We did push the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen island</a> out (toward the dining area) about a foot. That improved the ergonomics of the kitchen, particularly when navigating an inconveniently located cast-iron column. We replaced the cabinets, which gave us the flexibility to tweak the functionality, such as replacing the range on the former island with an induction <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooktop</a>. That left room in the island for three rows of deep drawers, which was a much better use of space for storing pans, utensils, and cookware than cabinets. We also found room to add an 18” wine fridge in the island.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-ovens-power-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall and speed oven combination</a> moved to the back wall, formerly dead counter space for a microwave and toaster oven. We did consider whether the column would interfere with the kitchen flow, especially with ovens on the other side. But it ended up working out fine. The high-traffic area (sink, refrigerator, cooktop) is together on one side of the column. The sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator were replaced but stayed in exactly the same locations, requiring minimal plumbing. Even though we added appliances, we gained storage space just by reconfiguring and making better use of the space we had.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer-dryer combo unit</a> had been in a column directly facing the kitchen island, a terrible location for laundry for traffic flow—and hygiene. The water heater was directly above the washer-dryer, making the whole section difficult to move. The simple solution was to rotate the units 180 degrees, so that laundry door was accessed next to the bathroom, which made more sense. The water heater was left as is.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A big priority was to formally close off the master bedroom. Working with a 100-year-old former warehouse came with some challenges. One was a column near the bedroom. Although it is beautiful, it just happened to get in the way of every floor plan. Working with our architect, we had to be creative in positioning the bedroom walls in a way to maximize their floor space while working around the columns. Using <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pocket doors</a> helped solved the problem since the column would have left no room for standard hinge doors. Storage was a priority throughout the loft. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master closet</a> is a wall-sized, reach-in, modular custom closet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the baby’s room, we took some space from the living room to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-is-a-legal-bedroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add the second bedroom</a>. Carving out the space was a challenge when constrained by the column, windows, door placement, and not taking too much square footage out of the master. In the end, we were just barely able to segment an 8-foot x 10-foot room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom had a clean, modern makeover with oversized floor-to-ceiling marble tiles. The floor plan stayed the same, but we were able to make substantial improvements with a few minor design adjustments. Once we demo’d, we found that the half-height wet wall behind the pedestal vanity was overbuilt and could be moved inward. This reclaimed a few inches of space needed for the new floating vanity. We also framed out a LED-lit, recessed shelf above this wet wall, giving the area more purpose. The medicine cabinet was set inside the wall, saving some airspace. These little adjustments made the wall feel a few inches deeper and between the shelf, floating vanity, and medicine cabinet, it provided a lot more storage. Above the bathroom’s dropped ceiling, and with a lot of maneuvering, we made space for the blower of the new ducted central air system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As is common in New York City, our apartment was heated with building-controlled steam heat. Our unit got a disproportionate share of that heat. In frustration, we removed the steam radiator altogether while adding a heating and cooling central air system. We also replaced the worn-down bamboo tiles with new white oak <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/">hardwood floors</a> throughout the rest of the apartment, <span style="color: #333333;">which we painted a designer white. </span>It keeps the whole space feeling open and bright.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten was great in helping us realize our vision. They understood our scope of work and did a great job at pairing us with excellent contractor options. Then, they walked us through the contractor selection process, helping us make an apples-to-apples comparison of the bids. The Sweeten contractor we ultimately chose to work with turned out to be an excellent pick. They became true partners in our process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One tip we want to pass on to future renovators is, if possible, rent a place close by so you can check in a few times a week. We did and were able to do weekly (sometimes multiple times per week) walk-throughs with our contractor. That gave us time to plan, troubleshoot, and exchange creative ideas. They also used software to track all aspects of the project, including timelines, material selections, work pictures<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>all of which was tremendously helpful and well organized, allowing us to complete our project within the planned four months. Sadly, a friend’s renovation that is similar to ours and started at the same time is still going.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most exciting part of this process is seeing our vision come to life. And getting storage because babies come with so much stuff!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>When Fabio and Melina won the bidding war on a two-bedroom Carnegie Hill apartment, they were amazed and delighted. With outdoor space, family-friendly amenities, and just one block from the new Second Avenue subway, it checked off all the right boxes. The only downside: it needed a thorough facelift and the clock was ticking on their rental apartment. Oh, and their baby was due any minute. Here’s how they juggled the ups and downs of renovating, while learning to be new parents—Melina gave birth to their son a month into the project!</i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22047 size-chrono" title="Carnegie Hill renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p><em>Guest post by Carnegie Hill homeowner Melina </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the lease of our functional but tiny, 550 square-foot, one-bedroom rental on the Upper East Side about to end and a baby boy on the way, the time came to try and buy a place. We set our hopes on a two-bedroom apartment in our neighborhood, ideally with great light and storage space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fast forward three months into our search and there were still no prospects. We were starting to lose hope! We went to every open house around us and looked at all options. Many of the apartments we visited were too expensive, too small, too dark, or way too far from any subway or daycare, which was our desired childcare plan. That is, until we visited a listing two blocks south of our rental and a block from the entrance of the new Second Avenue subway–whose opening, at the time, still sounded like a dream far in the future. The apartment itself was falling apart and looked straight out of “That ‘70s Show.” Only one family had occupied the home since the building was built 40 years ago, and no renovations had ever been done. Most of its walls were painted green, the living room had an entire wall covered in mirrors, and a popcorn ceiling ran throughout. However, the space was promising. A true two-bedroom on a high floor, with a large balcony off the living room, light (windows in every room!), and closet space. It came with basement storage, a bike room, a children’s playroom in-the-making, and a roof deck. Our only reservation was the need for a full renovation before moving in. Despite that, we made an offer, thinking we wouldn’t win the bidding war anyway. To our surprise, our best and almost unreasonable offer did.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22036 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-Before-02-1-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-Before-02 (1)" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21972 size-large" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/floorplan-2-600x516.jpg" alt="floorplan (2)" width="600" height="516" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We found Sweeten on an online search and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6445">posted our project </a>to be matched with builders. We were nervous about finding a contractor who could understand our expectations and timing constraints. The lease on our rental was ending before the summer, and so our move-in date was not flexible. We had less than four months to complete our entire renovation project. We chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177">our Sweeten contractor</a> because we immediately felt we could trust him in getting the job done in time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21973 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21976 size-chrono" title="kitchen pantry" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-15-16.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-15-16" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21974 size-chrono" title="farmhouse sink" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-13-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-13" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21975 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-14-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-14" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The focus for our renovation was the kitchen and bathroom. Fabio and I both love to cook and wanted a space where we could work together at the same time. The small bathroom needed to feel less cluttered and gain storage space. Our contractor provided decisive support, validated our suggestions, and helped to define the details before starting the work. We wanted to make this apartment our own, and he was happy to accommodate our choices, but he also made sure they were practical. As soon as we closed on the apartment, the team went in and started the demolition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before construction, we spent a lot of time pulling together the look and materials from home and design websites, so we had a strong point of view on the style we were trying to achieve. Our material choices included Carrara marble, cement and ceramic tile, classic New York hex tile in the bath, Edison bulbs, and black and white cabinets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We opened up the kitchen entryway slightly to let additional light come through to the dining area. We opted for countertops on opposite sides to maximize prep space and to accommodate a full semi-professional espresso setup—Fabio is a coffee geek. Our Sweeten contractor helped us finalize our design with <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA cabinets</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We spend a great deal of time in the kitchen and didn’t want strong colors we may grow tired of quickly, and settled on black cabinets with patterned ceramic floor tiles to add interest. While we tried to stay within our budget as much as possible, we splurged on professional heavy-duty appliances. We went with a modern version of a rustic farmhouse sink and purchased copper cabinet pulls online. The new kitchen is fantastic—the storage space feels especially luxurious compared to our previous kitchens.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21983 size-chrono" title="bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-03" width="723" height="1085" /></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21982 size-chrono" title="bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-02" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>We kept the bathroom’s tub and had it re-enameled but replaced the sink, cabinetry, hardware, and had the floor and walls retiled. We used a gold, black and white color theme that coordinated with the light fixtures and cement floor tiles. To create storage space, we built a new partially recessed medicine cabinet hidden behind the door. There was no heat in the bathroom, and with long New York winters in mind, we added a small towel heater.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The flooring throughout the apartment needed to be replaced, and our contractor took us to his supplier for a selection of inexpensive but great-looking wood flooring. We went with a light-colored wood with dark veins to generate an interesting contrast. The shelves in the rooms’ closets were falling apart. Initially, we planned on using IKEA shelving to replace them but because they weren’t standard size, we had them custom-designed by <a href="https://www.californiaclosets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Closets</a> to optimize our storage space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21986 size-chrono" title="Carnegie Hill renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-18-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-18" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>Our son was born one month into the renovation, and we were able to trust our contractor and his colleagues to handle the work with limited supervision. As with most renovation projects, some of our plans fell through unexpectedly, but our contractor and his team made sure we stayed on track and resolved every issue quickly and efficiently. The renovation has been complete for almost a year, and we could not be happier with our new apartment. Thanks to our contractor and Sweeten, we got our dream home and moved in on schedule.</p>
<p>Thank you Melina and Fabio for sharing how a renovation can be completed with grace under time constraint. We hope you continue to enjoy your home!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A creative Brooklyn couple came to Sweeten with an enviable problem: they had a gorgeous townhouse on their hands, big on charm and original details, but a little low on the storage and conveniences that a modern, entrepreneurial family needs. <a href="https://cupofjo.com/2016/02/my-beauty-uniform-kavi-ahuja-moltz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kavi Ahuja Moltz </a>and David Seth Moltz, the fabulous duo behind the small batch perfume and cologne company <a href="https://dsanddurga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D. S. &amp; Durga</a>, loved the rich wood trim that framed each window and the inlaid wood floors that ground each room, but earlier renovations in the kitchen and bathrooms had replaced many original materials with a hodge-podge of finishes. Seeking the skills of a designer and contractor, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to Sweeten, a free service matching homeowners with contractors, and we found their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4877#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> to re-think space and feel in the kitchen and two bathrooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-island-undermount-sink" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48507 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07.jpg" alt="White kitchen island with undermount sink and multifunctional faucet facing kitchen with abstract backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="668" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span id="more-17681"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Clinton Hill home presented an open kitchen plan with a large center island that had been updated with telltale features in the last decade: subway tile and a mix of wood finishes had been fit into an archway in the kitchen and pre-war moldings with gothic-inspired edges framed the oversized windows and a fridge nook. Storage was limited to two strips of base cabinetry and the butcher block counters added a third wood finish to the original floors and architectural details. Updates in the bathroom were similarly out of sync with the home’s original design, and a mix of modern tile, faux wood finishes, and slim storage left this family without a lot of storage options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor set out to preserve the most striking original floor and molding details and also push elements of the home toward a highly inventive and contemporary aesthetic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brown-hardwood-floor-kitchen-bathroom-before" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48518 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1.jpg" alt="Brown hardwood floored open kitchen and bathroom with tempered shower glass door before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Without destroying any of those gorgeous hardwood floors, he addressed the most pressing of the to-dos first. The base cabinets were completely removed and replaced with a full wall of semi-gloss, flat front, white cabinetry from HenryBuilt with hidden hardware, framing the striking new <a href="https://www.subzero-wolf.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolf</a> stove. While they did lose the original wall pocket trimmed in molding that housed the fridge, the new <a href="https://henrybuilt.com/page/henrybuilt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HenryBuilt</a> cabinets are far better suited for pantry purposes, and the new fridge was re-located to the right of the stove, camouflaged seamlessly with paneling. White stone composite counters replaced the butcher’s block, and a larger island replaced the former, keeping a similar silhouette with a mahogany base and ample knee space for diners. The stainless undermount sink was also enlarged, with a dramatic multi-functional chrome faucet, a standard workhorse behind the scenes in most restaurants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The backsplash is where the real drama resides. White subway tiles were replaced with a kaleidoscope of black, gray, and white triangular tiles creating quite the abstract pop of modernity to the new kitchen that’s now a contemporary haven trimmed in pre-war luxe.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In each of the two bathrooms, the crew took a related design approach to tie in inspiration across eras, addressing the finishes without changing the footprint entirely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In one full bath, tile again takes center stage with cement <a href="https://www.marrakechdesign.se/dandelion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dandelion tile</a> in Lawn/Milk on the floors. These hex tiles with watercolor edges and abstract white lines depicting sunbursts replaced the previous, more subdued flooring. Simple white hex tile grounds the walk-in shower, and classic white subway tile stacked in a herringbone pattern extends up and around the walls. Frameless glass shower doors, a glossy lacquered double vanity with deep drawer storage, and a heated towel rack perfect this stylish high-low mix of materials. And because no detail was overlooked by this stylish couple, they opted for polished brass light fixtures to offset the muted tones and white on white textures.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kids’ bath, a parallel mix of white and gray shapes work equally simply to create a clean and bright space. White hex floor tile and contrasting gray grout is echoed with industrial white subway wall tile and more contrasting grout. Their Sweeten contractor made room for a new tub and double vanity, and added extra towel bar storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21207 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05-1-723x469.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="469" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a design/build contracting team after a long search for a move-in ready pad in Williamsburg. He’d scoured New York’s ultra-competitive market for months and landed a charming but worn floor-through unit in a Graham Avenue co-op. The building was a century old and his unit hadn’t been touched since the ‘70s—but with high ceilings and old bones, Austin saw the many cons as potential pros: here was his chance to grab a well-located, window-filled blank slate and start anew. Austin <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project on Sweeten</a> and planned to put between $100,000 and $150,000 into the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a first-time renovator who spends his days as a consultant for media and cable groups, a full renovation game plan was admittedly ambitious. Sweeten introduced Austin to a contractor to create a sunny and spacious space that maximized every bit of square footage. One of Austin’s guiding goals was to make an apartment that anyone could enjoy, so he opted for a minimalist approach in a neutral color palette. To create the open and airy feeling that Austin was after, the contractors weighed in with suggestions for modern finishes and monochromatic tones that would unite the space and keep the focus on natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14998" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment_Before-01-4.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment_Before-01-4" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment_Before-01-4.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment_Before-01-4-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin and his Sweeten contractor team managed an incredible feat: with one single design choice, he brought an entirely new feel to the entire space. Matte-finish wide-plank hardwood flooring, and not all that much else, now sets the tone in this serene bedroom and throughout the living areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14984" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-07" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-07-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14982" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14991" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-14" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-14.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-14-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To create the kitchen, the team focused on making the most of a slightly slim layout. They swapped the former kitchen space into the living room and turned what was formally a bedroom into a new slim kitchen. They maximized its narrow footprint with all food prep and storage along one wall and then connected the space to the rest of the unit with French doors and glass panel details. Austin chose a very dark soapstone countertop with light marbling &#8211; a stand-out feature that is low maintenance and impervious to acid, bases, and heat. A custom table from <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Room and Board</a> turns the room into a hangout spot and pulls double-duty as both breakfast nook and workspace.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom showcases a blend of the old world and new, with a mosaic hexagon marble tile floor paired with more contemporary limestone on the walls. Couple that with a sprawling vanity and a stacked washer/dryer, and the project started to feel complete.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin initially worried that the process would be daunting, but thanks to regular check-ins and tech-savvy partners, the crew kept the project on time and on budget, even when surprise issues like termite damage came up. Since he was often traveling for work, his Sweeten contractors instituted regular check-ins and created a DropBox to share images of the progress with Austin, right down to snapshots of the inside of his insulated floors.</p>
