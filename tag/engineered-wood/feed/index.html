			<h2 class="p1">Considering refinishing your wood floors? Ask yourself these questions—and know the alternatives</h2>

<p class="p1">Hardwood floors are like cats: they have many lives. Depending on the type—engineered or solid—<a href="https://homeguides.sfgate.com/number-times-hardwood-floor-can-refinished-87146.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">they can be re-sanded</span></a> and stained from one to ten times. Refinishing wood floors can last up to a decade if the floors are treated gently. With that in mind, it’s sensible to think through whether you should refinish your hardwood floors. Sweeten takes a look at how refinishing takes both money and time, but it can be worthwhile in the end.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Benefits to Refinishing Your Wood Floors</h3>
<p class="p1">There are many benefits to refinishing your hardwood floors. It may be obvious that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooring is a major component to any space</a>. It’s also one that is easily overlooked because floors serve as the backdrop to furnishings and decor. Especially if your home is older, addressing any nicks and stains in your wood floors can give it an updated and finished feel.</p>
<p class="p1">Second, newly refinished hardwood floors are beautiful. While that could be considered an opinion, it’s one that many people hold: according to Money.com, <a href="https://money.com/boost-home-value/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">hardwood floors can add 3-5%</span></a> to your home’s value.</p>
<p class="p1">Their longevity is a helpful perspective to keep in mind during the days or weeks it takes to have the work done. As the saying goes, it’s short-term pain for long term gain!</p>
<h3 class="p1">Evaluate the Condition of Your Floors</h3>
<p class="p1">If you’ve lived in your home for a long time or weren’t able to refinish the floors before moving in, you’ll want to be sure that refinishing is the right route. Moving all of your <span class="s2">earthly</span> possessions out and then back into the rooms that need attention is no walk in the park!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Evaluate the condition of your wood floors carefully.</p>
<p class="p1">Some items to consider are:</p>
<h4>Can the floors withstand another sanding?</h4>
<p class="p5">Solid hardwoods can be re-sanded more times than engineered hardwoods due to the thickness of the hardwood surface. Make sure there is enough wood remaining before proceeding (You can discuss this with your contractor).</p>
<h4>Are the floors damaged?</h4>
<p class="p5">If there are dark stains, missing chunks or gaps, or mismatched wood (perhaps from a previous repair), it may be time to refinish. Spot-matching wood stain is difficult; a full sanding and refinishing is the only way to ensure color consistency.</p>
<h4>Do the floorboards smell?</h4>
<p class="p5">Along with stains can come odors. Depending on the source and strength of the odor, a simple coat of polyurethane could lock the smell away. Pet urine stains are difficult to remove; in this case, a complete refinish may be your best bet at resolving it.</p>
<h4>Are there soft spots on the floor?</h4>
<p class="p5">A soft spot can indicate a thin or rotted subfloor. Old water damage, or pet urine that was allowed to sit too long, could be to blame. When patching damaged wood, there is a chance the subfloor may need to be replaced in that area as well.</p>
<p class="p1">Floors that need patching or repairing are good candidates for refinishing. It’s the smoothness, color consistency, and the final shine that really make finished floors pop. Consider these points when you reflect on how refinishing may improve the overall look and feel of your home.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Alternatives to Refinishing Hardwood Floors</h3>
<p class="p1">There are times when refinishing is not in the cards for homeowners. It might not fit in the budget, or they may not have the time or resources to remove furniture from every room with wood floors. There are some alternatives where you can enjoy your existing wood floors and push back the timeline on needing to do a complete refinishing.</p>
<h4 class="p8">Painting hardwood floors</h4>
<p class="p1">The least expensive, and likely most controversial, alternative to refinishing your hardwood floors is to paint them.</p>
<p><i>Pros</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Paint allows homeowners to get creative with patterns.</li>
<li>Painting may be more in-line with a homeowner’s style; not everyone loves the look of refinished hardwoods.</li>
<li>Painting is less expensive than refinishing.</li>
<li>This option can extend the life of wood floors that are too thin to be re-sanded.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Cons</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Paint may not last as long; be sure to choose a durable material.</li>
<li>This is a more controversial alternative, as some people feel that painting hardwoods ruins them. This is a personal preference.</li>
<li>Chipped paint may be easily noticed.</li>
<li>Sanding off paint is more difficult than sanding a floor with standard refinishing.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p8">Repairing hardwood floors</h4>
<p class="p1">When time and money are tight, repairing select areas of damaged wood could be a good short-term option.</p>
<p><i>Pros</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Repairing localizes the work, which could eliminate the need to move out all of your furniture.</li>
<li>Focusing on repairing now means that your floors will be ready when it comes time for a full refinish.</li>
<li>Replacing damaged wood can eliminate trip or splinter hazards, odors, and soft spots. This alone could make a room feel more comfortable.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Cons</i></p>
<ul>
<li>The color of the wood will not be consistent and the patching may be obvious.</li>
<li>Some contractors may prefer to do all the work at once, making it more difficult to find a contractor for this smaller job. However, it can be added onto a renovation you may already be having elsewhere in the home.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p8">Sealing hardwood floors</h4>
<p class="p1">This is a less expensive option that will help to protect your floors from further wear and tear. It skips the sanding and staining steps; simply add a coat of polyurethane.</p>
<p><i>Pros</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Skipping the sanding step means no dust!</li>
<li>Sealing will protect your floors for a few more years. If you are renting out the home, or want to wait to refinish until selling a home, this is a good option.</li>
<li>Sealing can help to reduce odor from pet stains.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Cons</i></p>
<ul>
<li>You will still need to remove all of your furniture so that floors can be sealed with a coat or two of polyurethane.</li>
<li>The smell of fresh polyurethane may take some time to dissipate.</li>
<li>You will need to seal again if you intend to refinish down the road; this essentially adds a cost to the total floor care.</li>
<li>Stains or gaps will still be visible since they were not sanded out or repaired.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">Questions to Ask Your Contractor</h3>
<p class="p1">Not all floor refinishing contractors are alike. They offer different levels of service, and some even use different equipment. When hiring a contractor for refinishing wood floors, ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>How will my rooms and furniture be protected? </i></li>
</ul>
<p class="p11">Sanding floors creates a substantial amount of dust. If you have rooms that won’t be emptied while work is being done, you’ll want to ask how those rooms will remain clean. Some contractors offer a dustless service. This means the contractor uses a sander with a vacuum that draws the dust out of the home during the sanding process. While “dustless” is not 100% dust-free, it will significantly cut down the mess you will need to clean up after the job is finished. If they don’t offer dustless sanding, ask if the contractor will seal off rooms that won’t need sanding with plastic or canvas drop cloths.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><i>Be aware of the timeline.</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="p11">If you are repairing or adding additional wood flooring, be aware that wood boards need to acclimate to your home’s temperature and humidity before being installed. Also, you will not have access to walk on your floors while the stain and varnish is drying, and you may want to air out the house from their smell. Ask how long each of these items will add to the timeline.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><i>Cost considerations</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="p11">Some contractors have an average price per square foot they will quote. If you have areas that need additional attention (squeaks, soft spots, staining), ask how much addressing those issues will add to the total cost.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><i>Flooring transitions</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="p11">In instances where new wood will meet with old, discuss with your contractor how the transition between new and old wood will happen. This could include areas that need patching, or where an adjacent room’s flooring is replaced with hardwoods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ask if they will match the wood type and size, or if they can make the transition look seamless.</p>
<h4>Deciding to refinish hardwood floors</h4>
<p class="p1">There is a lot to consider when it comes to refinishing hardwood floors. Do your research, and get quotes from multiple contractors who specialize in it. Ask questions<span>—and make sure you understand all options at your disposal.</span> In the end, that’s the best way to be confident in knowing whether refinishing your hardwood floors is right for your home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">The lowdown on wood flooring options—solid, engineered, reclaimed—and how to choose</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20504 size-chrono" title="hardwood flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg" alt="sweeten_rima_hardwood_flooring-10" width="723" height="482" /></a>(Above) Rima installed mid-sized <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/rimas-ikea-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plank engineered wood</a> with a matte finish throughout her home.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Of all the surface options available for the home, hardwood flooring remains the one with the most cachet and value. After all, it&#8217;s warm in appearance, easy underfoot (especially compared to tile or stone), versatile in application thanks to the range of wood species and finishes available, and innately luxurious. From solid to engineered to salvaged, you’re likely to find an option that suits your home’s style as well as your lifestyle.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Wood flooring prices can vary greatly, depending on where the flooring was manufactured, how it was made, how it was finished, and who’s installing it. Base your decision on where the floor will go, and what type of activity those rooms will see. Flooring is an investment—of resources and the time it takes to install it. Make the right choice, and you will enjoy your wood floor for probably as long as you want it.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Consider your lifestyle</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">First, examine what the room or room(s) will be used for, how much traffic they will experience, and what kind. Wood can be enjoyed throughout most homes, with a few precautions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Will there be pets scratching it with their nails? </span><span class="s1">High heels from frequent entertaining? </span><span class="s1">Toys from energetic little ones?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Do you expect grit consistently tracked from the front door or backyard? </span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does the room get loads of sunlight that could fade the surface in some areas? </span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Is there the possibility of accidental yet prolonged exposure to water, next to a dishwasher or by a bathtub, which could cause the floor to swell? </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Today’s hardwood flooring often features highly durable polyurethane coatings that are formulated to stand up to light or average wear, but you will need to commit yourself to a regular maintenance routine in order to keep the surface beautiful. And engineered versions, with a wood veneer backed by a composite that helps assure its stability (while slightly lowering the cost compared to its solid wood cousin), can sometimes go in environments that experience some moisture, like a basement or a bathroom.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27034 size-chrono" title="engineered wood flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="hardwood flooring" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) Throughout Tom and Alex&#8217;s apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/mid-century-mad-men-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engineered wood</a> replaced old parquet floors.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Customize the look</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Each species of wood has its own color and grain, and the choice is yours. Appearance has expanded beyond classic wood species and stains to include colored washes and dramatic textures added during manufacturing, from classic satin to wire-brushed to scraped. These distressed effects also serve to hide some wear over time as well as enhance character. Dimensions vary, too, from traditional narrow strips to wide planks that lend a rustic mood and also means fewer seams into the overall floor.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The hardness of the wood should be taken into account, too. If your floor will see a lot of action, you want one of the harder species, like oak, maple, or hickory. The ranking system for hardness among different species, called the Janka hardness test, measures how a wood stands up to dents and wear. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Finishes affect the overall style, with a range of high, medium, or low gloss available from most manufacturers, depending on whether you want a highly polished or a more satiny effect. The finish, applied in anywhere from three to seven coats, should include aluminum oxide to make it resistant to the abrasions of daily foot traffic. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Click-lock versus tongue-and-groove</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Edge treatments vary widely to give you plenty of options to achieve the look you want, from square to beveled to scraped to pillowed. Wood floors connect one edge to another by means of two methods: </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Like the term implies, click-lock boards click into place to provide an almost seamless appearance, except for the grain of the wood. Found in engineered wood flooring, these require no adhesive and so the installation tends to go faster.</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The tongue-and-groove method fits together using a thin piece on one long side that fits into the grooved indenture on the adjoining board’s side. Planks are further secured when nailed, glued, or laid in a floating installation. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28816" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02-1-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />(Above) Dark walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardwood flooring</a> in Jonathan and Cecilia&#8217;s home adds richness and a sense of depth to their space.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Get real with solid hardwood</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solid hardwood</a> comes either factory-finished or can be finished on site. Factory-finished flooring arrives needing only to be installed, making it clean and quick to lay down. This method eliminates or reduces the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The curing that site-finished wood requires (which can take up to two months as the wood adjusts to your home’s climate)</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Dust from sanding</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Chemical fumes from the finish</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Length of time from start of installation to complete drying of finish</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Length of time to final use of room</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The finish is also cured under UV lights at the factory, a process that can’t happen on site, so the factory-finish is likely tougher than the one applied on site. This floor should also include a warranty from the manufacturer instead of the installer. The main benefit of having a site-finished floor is if you desire total control over the final look. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Factory-finished floors typically arrive already topped with several layers of a water- or oil-based polyurethane coating that incorporates aluminum oxide to protect the wood from scratches and fading due to sunlight. A clear top coat provides the glossy or satin appearance. This floor can be refinished several times until the multilayer coating is completely removed, which then means reapplying the finish or, in extreme situations, replacing the plank. If your floor is finished on site, discuss with the installer what type of finish he recommends, and if it includes aluminum oxide.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Caution: Solid wood is a natural material, making it vulnerable to swings in temperature and humidity. Because it will expand and contract, it must be fastened to a subfloor but not concrete, so it can’t go below-grade or in damp areas like a basement or a bath that gets lots of steam.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28813 size-chrono" title="engineered wood floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="hardwood flooring" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engineered wood</a> finished with a natural veneer pairs well with exposed brick in Miguel&#8217;s bedroom.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If it looks like it’s real wood, that’s because it is—a veneer of real wood atop a structural base, typically plywood. The base gives it added stability so it can go in a bath or a basement, as well as over radiant heating elements. It requires fewer trees than solid hardwood, but the base includes glues that bind the plywood and the veneer. This option is easy to install as a floating floor or it can be secured with staples or glue. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Expect to find all the classic species of woods and stains in this engineered wood category, as well as some fun fashion colors like a gray wash. You’ll discover a range of quality, too, so when shopping, investigate the thickness of the veneer, the number of protective coatings, and the number of ply in the base, which can range from three to seven and up. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Refinishing engineered wood is far more limited than solid wood—as little as once, depending on the thickness of the veneer. Buy an extra box in the event you need to replace a plank, so you don’t have to worry about matching. Ask about warranties for both the finish and veneer delamination.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Go authentic with reclaimed wood</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Probably the most environmentally-friendly choice, reclaimed wood that is salvaged from old buildings requires no cutting of trees. Its unique appeal comes from its original sourcing, which may be domestic woods that are now rare or unavailable for residential use. Like a vintage wine, reclaimed wood also shows a character that can’t be reproduced today, even from advanced manufacturing techniques. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This wood is typically sourced from old factories, deconstructed homes, old decking or piers, but it still has to be treated to go into its new home. It may be warped or cracked in areas, and so require some milling before it’s ready for installation. Make sure the wood is kiln-dried after milling, as this will aid its stability and also eliminate the possibility of critters, such as termites. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This category can be found from a few national dealers, like Mountain Lumber, or locally by doing a search online, but if you shop from an independent dealer, make sure he or she guarantees the product.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Consider maintenance and repair </b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The biggest enemy of your wood floor is nearly invisible grit tracked in on shoes. Place area rugs or mats at entry points to catch dirt. Try to sweep or vacuum daily, clean monthly with a wood floor cleaner recommended by the manufacturer, so you can enjoy your floor for a lifetime.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Light or dark, wide-plank flooring is a smart investment that provides lasting style</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Much like a pair of jeans, wide-plank flooring is a classic design that comes in a variety of materials and finishes and can adapt to any <span style="color: #000000;">decor</span>. It works in every room of your home as a dependable canvas for the rest of your design choices and furnishings. This width comes in engineered and hardwood styles, both of which are high-quality and long-lasting. If you’re thinking about a cost-effective option, engineered is the way to go. However, if you really want <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardwood</a>, go for it! Don’t be discouraged by daily wear and tear. Like those jeans we talked about earlier, hardwood only gets better with age. Below, five Sweeten homeowners use wide-plank flooring to complete the look of their homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25922 size-chrono" title="wide plank flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-13-723x1095.jpg" alt="wide plank flooring" width="723" height="1095" /></a>A hallway in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/scandi-brooklyn-sweetened-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton Hill home</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Clinton Hill couple replaced orange-hued parquet with matte wide-plank flooring to set the tone of their home, outfitting their main hallway, kitchen, and combined dining and living spaces with it. They chose a high-grade engineered wood in a pale shade that counterbalances the white walls.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25923 size-chrono" title="wide plank flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05-723x469.jpg" alt="wide plank flooring" width="723" height="469" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-austins-williamsburg-co-op-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Austin’s bedroom</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin’s pale shade of matte flooring looks familiar, but unlike the Clinton Hill couple, his bedroom floor is made of hardwood. The feeling is fresh and simple and contributes to his home’s sense of serenity.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25924 size-chrono" title="wide plank flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="wide plank flooring" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron’s kitchen</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Ron’s apartment, dark, wide-plank <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a>, fully waterproofed, adds richness to an all-white kitchen. The engineered wood planks continue throughout the living and dining spaces, providing a touch of drama within the home’s otherwise neutral palette of sand and beige tones<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_ClaudiaNursery-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25925 size-chrono" title="wide plank flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_ClaudiaNursery-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="wide plank flooring" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/claudia-and-alejandros-boerum-hill-condo-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claudia and Alejandro’s nursery</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claudia tore out the old, yellow tinted floors and installed a light oak floor in every room of her home, including the nursery. Paired with lightly colored walls, the look is soft and dreamy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MarioApt-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25926 size-chrono" title="wide plank flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MarioApt-14-723x468.jpg" alt="wide-plank flooring" width="723" height="468" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mario and Joe’s kitchen</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another take on oak: Mario and Joe chose matte wide-plank flooring to modernize the appearance of their apartment. In the kitchen, layered rugs add color and texture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Good news: You can have pretty much whatever you want, as long as you follow a few guidelines</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22170 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="Maple engineered wood flooring in IKEA kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label">Engineered wood flooring in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/rimas-ikea-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rima&#8217;s</a> kitchen</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The decisions to be made when designing a kitchen can be daunting—the sheer number alone, let alone the anxiety. Will this material work in the cook space? Will it hold up? Will I still like it in five years? Factor in a growing family and those worries begin to multiply: What if the kids drop their juice boxes; will it stain? What if my child falls&#8230;will he hurt himself?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides looks and function, you need to consider what type of traffic the flooring will experience. Is it off the garage or a deck, where dirt can be tracked in? Do you also have pets that can scratch with claws or bring water and dirt from outside? Is your child in a high chair that gets dragged around frequently in one area, or has he graduated to his own mini vehicle during playtime, adding to the wear and tear? Health is a factor, too, of course, and any flooring that is manufactured and/or has a finish should be able to provide a rating for its various contents and performance, including VOC emission and slippage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take all of these factors into account as you consider the following materials underfoot. The good news: You can install just about whatever you want, and, with a few precautions, continue to enjoy it as your family grows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hardwood</strong><br />
Sought out for its natural elegance, wood also delivers a lot: It offers a slight pliancy underfoot so items you drop are less likely to break than on a harder surface such as tile. The two basic wood options:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Solid wood</strong></span><br />
If you love solid wood, opt for prefinished floors (aka, “factory finished”) that come from the factory with a hard-wearing top coat of aluminum oxide urethane that offers protection from scratches while minimizing upkeep, like waxing; daily sweeping should do it. Ask your dealer about the warranty, which should be provided by the manufacturer and not the installer, so you have greater recourse if the floor needs a major or immediate repair. This type of floor also can be refinished, as long as the dings are not too deep. If your preference is for hardwood but you worry about those dings, take a look at “distressed” styles that can disguise any new dents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: This type of floor will fade with regular exposure to sunlight, so don’t put it by a window that ushers in strong daily outdoor sun. You also need to think about exposure to moisture—say, a leak at the dishwasher or fridge, or water constantly splashed by the sink. And if your toddler drops food by the high chair, you will want to take a precaution and put a mat underneath, to prevent spotting or stains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Engineered wood</strong></span><br />
The other option in this category is engineered wood flooring, which is made of a thin veneer of real wood attached to structural plywood. It should cost a little less than solid wood, but depending on the thickness of the veneer, you may not be able to refinish it, making it not such a thrifty choice after all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Formaldehyde, used as an adhesive, can be found in some engineered wood floors, including bamboo (see below), but at the present time this chemical is not strictly regulated, so you need to inquire with the salesperson or manufacturer with regard to any floor made with pressed wood or medium density fiberboard (MDF).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bamboo</strong><br />
Although actually a grass, bamboo is sold with hardwoods for many of the same reasons—looks natural and warm, endures light to medium wear, is easy underfoot. Most bamboo flooring is made of a bamboo veneer attached to a backing such as plywood or MDF. But you need to be mindful of quality. Bamboo gets treated with many chemicals to turn it into a material suitable for flooring so off-gassing can be a factor. Also, this relative newcomer to flooring has many manufacturing sources and quality control is not yet highly regulated. Investigate thoroughly, as with any product you bring into your home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Laminate</strong><br />
This type of flooring is similar to laminate countertops, in that it is composed of dense fiberboard topped with a photographic image of a real wood (or other material) that is then topped with a clear protective layer. With the development of HD printing, laminate offers a lot of different wood looks, and you can mix several styles (e.g., a pale oak with a colored border) to achieve some fun effects. It tends to resist light scratching and fading from sunlight. And that hollow sound that turned off many homeowners once upon a time has been eliminated by many manufacturers that incorporate underneath a sound-muffling material like cork. Laminate is installed as a “floating floor,” which means there’s no glue or nails. Boards connect by means of an interlocking tongue and groove design. Since there’s no need to connect the boards to a subfloor, they can be installed over any uneven surface as long as it’s sealed and remains dry. This makes laminate a good solution till little ones are more grown up if you want to replace it eventually with tile or real wood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Laminate wears well but like wood, it won’t withstand prolonged exposure to water, and it’s slippery when wet. Also, it can’t be refinished; if there’s damage, you’ll have to replace the entire board so order extra to have an exact match if needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Resilient</strong><br />
Mostly vinyl falls into this category, but there’s also linoleum. As the term “resilient” indicates, this flooring is easy on humans, when little ones fall or adults stand for long periods when prepping a meal, and if you drop a dish, it’s less likely to break on this surface than on tile or even wood. It also handles a lot of wear or sunlight and resists stains from food and drink spills as well as crayons and magic markers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vinyl</strong></span><br />
Recent advances in manufacturing have improved performance since the days when vinyl was for your grandmother’s laundry room. You can now find vinyl that infuses the surface with cultured diamond particles for increased protection against dents, scratches, scuffs, and stains. HD printing advancements allow you to choose a vinyl that really looks like wood or tile. Peer closely, though, and you’ll know it’s vinyl, but the faux effects can be part of its fashion-forward appeal. Vinyl remains probably your thriftiest choice, depending on the pattern.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Linoleum</strong></span><br />
Linoleum is sought for its range of saturated colors or marbled effects, resiliency, slip resistance and everyday wear. It comes in sheets, for an almost seamless appearance, as well as tiles if you want a classic checkerboard or just like that look. Made of linseed oil and other naturally sourced materials, linoleum is marketed as a “green” flooring choice, but in fact, it requires chemicals, too, to arrive at the finished product, so ask the salesperson about off-gassing and VOC ratings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Both wear well but can’t be refinished. Buy extra in case of repairs so you can match the area you need to patch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tile</strong><br />
While tile comes in both ceramic and porcelain, the latter is the harder of the two and thus more appropriate for most floors that see a lot of foot traffic. Completely resistant to fading, scratches, and moisture, tile is good for a busy household. And since it’s sealed with a fired-on glaze, it’s good if allergies are an issue, but you will want to take some precautions with youngsters in the house. Until children are old enough where toddling and falling is not an issue, use a rug in areas where little ones congregate. An expansive indoor/outdoor area rug that can be taken outside and hosed off will help protect little ones while adding a splash of colorful style. Many tiles are slip resistant since they are used in commercial areas, so ask the salesperson about this rating, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Dishware will break on this super-hard surface, and tile can crack if not installed by a pro on a perfectly smooth surface. A rug that protects little ones may have to be cleaned regularly.</p>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Rima Rivera, Brooklyn homeowner</span></i><span id="more-17096"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I purchased my one-bedroom apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops five years ago after a very extensive search. I loved the vibe there and thought the apartment had great bones &#8212; and moving from Manhattan, it was larger than any recent apartment I’d had. The place was in decent enough condition when I bought it, but I had every intention of modernizing it. Of course, I couldn’t do it right away because I was financially exhausted after the purchase. So for four years, I sat in my living room fantasizing about my dream apartment, trying to muster up the courage and the money I would need to embark on a major renovation. I was familiar with Sweeten after neighbors recommended the site and frequently used the blog for inspiration. When I was finally ready to pull the trigger, I knew who to call.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I posted my renovation project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten linked me with Sweeten Expert Bobby</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Bobby was a perfect find for someone like me (overwhelmed and a total novice at the whole renovation process!). I told Bobby that I wanted to modernize the kitchen and bathroom and lay down a new floor. I also told him I would love to open up the kitchen and extend it out into the dining area, but I feared that the irregular layout would not allow for it and that I would be limited to working within the constraints of the small space. Bobby assured me that he would be able to tear down the entry wall to the galley kitchen and also open a pass-through on the main kitchen wall so that I’d be able to get more light into the apartment.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17107" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the project started, the new pass-through kept getting bigger and bigger until Bobby suggested I just tear down the entire wall and consider an open-concept kitchen. There was a heating pipe that obviously couldn’t be removed, and we learned that we could not move the stove to the opposite wall, so I couldn’t visualize how it would be done. Bobby is also a designer and when he provided me with a 3-D image that incorporated a hanging range hood, I was totally over the moon, though still skeptical that he could pull it off.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meanwhile, I had to decide on materials and fixtures, and although I spent four years daydreaming of this big event, I totally froze and hit a wall of indecision and doubt. Do I go with shaker-style cabinets or modern gloss, Ikea or custom, pedestal sink or storage vanity, dark floors or light? Color was the only easy choice for me since I’m not a fan of color&#8230;all my picks seemed to lead to gray or white.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17097" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="kitchen with ikea cabinets" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17098" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="L-shaped kitchen remodel" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17100" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="Ringhult glossy cabinets from IKEA" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I finally decided on the Ringhult glossy cabinet series from Ikea for the kitchen with white upper cabinets and gray on the bottom, split by a snow white quartz countertop. I decided on light maple for the floors after Bobby advised me to check out Hamilton Carpet One Floors in Maspeth, and I was able to floor the entire apartment with mid-size plank engineered wood at a reasonable price. The new wood flooring has a nice matte finish and really transformed the look and feel of the apartment, making it seem larger and fresher. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My last bout with indecision was at the very end. What to do about the backsplash…</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I went with subway tiles in the bathroom, I was leaning toward doing the same in the kitchen. But since I was only tiling a small area, family and friends attempted to push me out of my comfort zone and encouraged me to go for something bold and colorful. I didn’t go with subway tiles but I did disappoint a few folks after passing again on color and choosing a gray and white hex tile that I purchased from Home Tile Center of NY in LIC. I personally love those tiles!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17099" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="hex tile backsplash" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17101" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="butcher wood countertop" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I replaced everything in the bathroom &#8211; new tiles, new tub, new toilet, new sink, new storage. I had basic white subway tiles in mind from the start and chose a porcelain floor tile with a faux-wood finish in a large, modern size. I fit in new under-sink storage with Ikea’s Godmorgon glossy gray bathroom vanity and also added a wall-mounted cabinet facing the vanity and beveled medicine cabinet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17102" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="ikea bathroom remodel" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17103" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-08.gif" alt="bathroom mirror cabinets" width="600" height="899" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17105" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg" alt="bathroom subway tiles" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole process came together seamlessly &#8212; something you don’t hear often when it comes to renovation jobs. There were no major hiccups and Bobby helped me control costs often making cost-saving recommendations. At the end, I had extra money to modernize the hardware on all the doors and open up the entrance to my bedroom closet, installing double doors. Happily, I no longer have to stretch and reach blindly for my favorite wool sweater. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next phase, in hopefully the not-too-distant future: recessed lighting!</span></p>
