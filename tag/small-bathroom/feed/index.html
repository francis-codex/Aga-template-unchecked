<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Homeowner:</strong> Veronica posted her </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/home-remodeling-projects/new-york/new-york/10024/39852#after"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bathroom remodel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Where:</strong> Upper West Side in Manhattan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> Leaky plumbing expands to renovating the whole small space bathroom</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>With: </strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4810#overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Homeowner’s quote:</strong> “I was really looking forward to designing a bathroom that had a walk-in shower with a glass door.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with homeowner Veronica. &#8220;</i></span><span class="s1"><i>After&#8221; photos by Kate Glicksberg.</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When commercial photographer, Veronica, moved into her Upper West Side apartment in 2014, she considered it move-in ready.  “All I had to do was paint and tile the kitchen,” she explains. “I hoped to redo the bathroom one day, but it seemed like an overwhelming and big job—and especially expensive in New York City.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="bathroom-with-pink-walls-before-renovation" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43856" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-before.jpg" alt="compact bathroom with single vanity and medicine cabinet and pink tiles walls and floor and bathtub before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-before.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-before-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cut to a few years later. She received a complaint from her neighbors directly below and after investigating, it turned out her tub was leaking into their apartment. “I had a plumber check it out, and he confirmed I’d have to get the tub replaced to fix the leak,” says Veronica. Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it), that meant the attached surrounding tile would need to be replaced. “It kind of became a domino effect of redoing everything, but I figured it was a good time to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make some upgrades</a>,” she says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veronica was more than happy to get rid of the outdated beige tile and grimy old jet tub and posted her project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>. “I was really looking forward to designing a bathroom that had a walk-in shower with a glass door,” she says. The light fixture didn’t work and the vanity was small and crammed in next to the shower so it was a no-brainer to replace those as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bathroom was transformed from a basic beige bathroom into a rich, modern space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Through Sweeten, Veronica found the contractor who would renovate her space with her vision in mind. “The bathroom got very little light to begin with so I decided to embrace the cave-like atmosphere and go dark,” Veronica says.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="shower-with-black-subway-tiles" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43858" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-6-dark-tile-walkin-shower-jpg.jpg" alt="bathroom with floating sink and gold faucet and fixtures and black paint on wall and walk-in shower with black subway tiles and glass wall after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-6-dark-tile-walkin-shower-jpg.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-6-dark-tile-walkin-shower-jpg-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-6-dark-tile-walkin-shower-jpg-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44130 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-bathroom-4.jpg" alt="Black bathroom tile" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-bathroom-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-bathroom-4-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added matte brass fixtures for warmth as well as marble floor tile for texture. “My favorite thing is the walk-in shower,” says Veronica. &#8220;It’s so much easier to clean, it makes the tiny space feel more open, and it gives a modern look and feel.” </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having a wall-mounted sink without a vanity also opened up the room. Veronica was &#8220;glad not to have crammed in an 18-inch vanity that doesn’t hold much anyway and visually disrupts the room.&#8221; Initially, the plan was to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-hung-toilets-look-behind-scenes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">install a wall-mounted toilet</a></span><span class="s1"> but found out that it was out of the budget and required permits.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44129 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-bathroom-2.jpg" alt="black and gold bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-bathroom-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-bathroom-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Veronica-bathroom-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: A cabinet above the bathroom door serves as added storage for towels and other supplies. </span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>:</strong> Credit a steady diet of renovation TV shows with inspiring this 22nd-floor bathroom makeover. Owner Charlie Wintczak occupied the apartment for the better part of a decade, relishing its central location—between the Hudson River and Central Park. But he came to see the boring, under-40-square-foot bathroom as ho-hum. “I wanted it to look bigger,” he recalls.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>:</strong> He interviewed three Sweeten contractors and chose his <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contractor</a> based partly on his shopping advice. One of those suggestions led to a Long Island City showroom for the vanity and tiles used throughout.</p>
<p>The previous owner’s amateurish tiling got swapped out for new large-format tiles behind the vanity and toilet. That same tile continues into the shower stall, which replaced an old tub. Upgrades include frameless glass shower partitions and a low stone curb that allows the mosaic tile shower floor inside to slope, for drainage.</p>
<p>The replacement toilet has buttons for a water-conserving half-flush, a prized green-design feature. The contractor also suggested the website that yielded Charlie&#8217;s hardware and accessories. A final recommendation supplied the metal barn door hardware fitted on-site with a new white-painted panel door that matches others in the apartment.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>:</strong> Welcome energy is delivered by the owner’s idea of a pop of color: soft green paint for one bathroom wall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An awkward space turns sanctuary with a few simple ideas</h2>
<p>When a long apartment search finally ended, Victoria’s Secret designer Christine Yao returned to one of the first listings already crossed off her list. It was the one she ultimately closed on, and she was happy with her new home—except for her bathroom which felt like showering in a dark closet. An internet search led her to Sweeten and a match with a general contractor, who would help transform the space to echo the layout and feel of the baths she&#8217;d been pinning on Pinterest for months. With smart space reconfigurations (including a vintage sliding door) and good project management, he made it happen. In her own words, Christine tells the story, from how the thought of renovating scared her to the completion of her relaxing new dwelling.</p>

<p><em>Guest post by East Village homeowner Christine Yao</em></p>
<p>I had been living on the Lower East Side for about five years when I started looking for a place to own. My weekends became a routine, waking up and planning errands around my StreetEasy open house schedule and any listings my real estate agent sent me. The beginning was packed, usually a few on Saturday and also Sundays when I walked all over downtown and viewed up to six apartments. You quickly realize that when you are focused on staying in a specific area—for me that was roughly LES/Chinatown/East Village—there are a limited number of places to see. At first, it seemed like there were hundreds of apartments for sale, and maybe 50 you can afford. You feel like half of the 50 may not even be worth seeing from the photos but you go see them anyway. A friend who had gone through the home-buying process made a comparison to online dating—one can only tell so much from the photos, you just have to go and see it in person to really know! A few months in, I had lost out on two places, and felt a little hopeless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #a69f3d;"><em><strong>&#8220;No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?&#8221;</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, finally, six months after I started looking, I had an accepted offer and closed on a co-op in the East Village. I had actually seen this apartment at the very beginnings of my search. My brother was in town on a Sunday when I dragged him from one open house to another. We thought the apartment was in an awesome location, and was a nice size. It needed some cosmetic work, but both agreed the bathroom was terrible. It had a wall right in the middle of it with the bathtub half concealed, so it felt like you were showering in a dark closet. It was cramped, with an awkward layout, and was just in bad shape. So I crossed it off the list. The idea of a bathroom renovation was overwhelming to me, on top of buying my first home. Then six months of searching made me re-think—maybe I could. No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?</p>

<p>So now, I had a bathroom to renovate, a living space that needed a refresh, and no idea where to start. The internet brought me to Sweeten. I liked how simple and straightforward it made finding a contractor: you <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project</a> and general contractors are matched for your job. I decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>—his work was most similar to the aesthetic I was going for and he had completed a project on Sweeten with a great review.</p>
<p>My plan for the entire apartment’s look was minimalist. I love a clean space that still feels warm and cozy. Greek cave hotels and Moroccan riads are a big inspiration for me. I did have a vision of wanting the apartment to feel like a vacation&#8230;somewhere tropical and feels relaxing when you are there. The kitchen, main living area, and two bedrooms just needed a redesign. But I couldn’t imagine my day-to-day in the previous bathroom—the door opening awkwardly, the dark shower, and not being able to enjoy a bath.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21714" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02 (1)" width="600" height="900" /></p>
<p>I was hoping the middle wall obstruction could be partially removed but we wouldn’t know if it was structural until the demo. Turns out the wall had all the building plumbing running through it, so needless to say, it had to stay. However, we found serious leaks happening on the floors above and below me (I am on the third floor of a five-story building), which the building would have to fix before we could move forward. Since pipes had to be replaced, the plumbing could be re-routed, allowing us to swap tub and toilet positioning. This worked out for the best: the toilet in a “nook,” and the bathtub by the window.</p>
<p>I had so many images on my desktop saved for ideas and realized they all had the common thread of black tile floors and clean, white walls with modern fixtures. I was getting a lot of inspiration from restaurant and hotel restrooms. I definitely wanted recessed lighting above the toilet (dimmers are a must for all lighting—mood!) and exposed plumbing under the sink for more leg room.</p>
<p>I ended up ordering almost everything on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>, which has phenomenal customer service by the way. I must have looked at hundreds of sinks. We realized it had to be a corner sink or you wouldn’t have enough space to get on and off the toilet. Then the toilet had to be an appropriate size. Measured twice, measure one more time, then cross my fingers when it came in. It all fit into this Tetris game of a bathroom! I wanted a sliding door that would let light through and found an old office door at Big Reuse in Gowanus, Brooklyn. My contractor cut it down to fit the doorway and painted it.</p>

<p>The renovation was running a couple months late due to waiting on permits, so taking things like a toilet and subway tile from Home Depot that were in stock was a priority. My Sweeten contractor was so easy to work with and made things stress-free on everything from dealing with the unexpected delays and permits to coordinating a time to receive a bathtub delivery. I also trusted his aesthetic and opinion on any design or materials questions I had.</p>
<p>As far as the rest of the apartment, it’s amazing what fresh paint and swapping out things like lighting, doorknobs, and some cabinet doors can do. He did a fantastic painting job and the white floors are my favorite feature of my home. My original budget was $25,000 for renovating the bathroom and repainting the apartment. I ended up going $4,500 overbudget because I live in a co-op. The process of getting permits and running into unforeseen issues with plumbing in-between the floors increased the costs and timeline. A six-week planned renovation turned into three months. I think it was really just me underestimating the cost of labor and materials, especially living here in New York City.</p>

<p>The bathroom turned out better than I could have hoped and I am so thankful for the successful renovation I had with my contractor through Sweeten. Now that I’ve experienced the process, the advice I can offer is to be prepared for it to take longer than you think. And add another month. Be prepared to spend a good chunk of time every day on it—coordinating with your contractor, arranging delivery times, looking for fixtures, going to check on things, etc. Be ready to laugh when things go wrong. And go wrong again. It’ll be worth it when you are enjoying your renovated place, I promise.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot about the kitchen—with all of my budget going to the bathroom and painting, I just took down the cabinet doors myself and painted. That’s a move I’ve done in many apartments I’ve lived in as a renter. It’s functional for now but I can’t wait to renovate this space next!</p>
<p>Thank you Christine, for sharing your story as a first-time homeowner and renovator! You proved that a few renovating ideas can make a big impact, and we love your fresh style.</p>
