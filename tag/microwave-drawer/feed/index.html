<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-kitchen-custom-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen with custom cabinets and kitchen island with butcher block after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Expanding a cramped kitchen in a Clinton Hill landmark townhouse</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: In 2013, Kate and her husband, Graham, purchased a 4-unit townhouse built in 1890 in Clinton Hill, and moved into it with her two brothers and their families. (They operate the apartments within the townhouse as informal condos and share costs and decision-making.) While they knew that there were changes that needed to be made, they did not consider a gut renovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-01-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" title="over-door-detailing-entrance-before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-01-723x482.jpg" alt="over door detailing and entrance before renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets and white counter before renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Four years down the line, after living in the space, they determined that expanding and redoing a tiny kitchen that was tucked into the back corner of their apartment was a priority. It was closed off from the rest of the apartment inside an addition to the original house. The addition had been divided into a small galley kitchen and a second room that was “too small to be a living room or a dining room,” explained Kate. The narrow kitchen had small, outdated appliances and the refrigerator was awkwardly placed in front of a window. It was hard for two people to pass each other in the space. Given that the kitchen did not function at all the way their family needed it to, the couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/21244" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project to Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Working with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Sweeten contractor</a>, Kate and Graham envisioned an open space so that meal prep could be “a family activity and a space for doing homework while dinner was getting made,” said Kate. They wanted to go vertical with custom cabinets and counters to maximize the amount of surface and storage space. While they did need to remove a wall and a closet, they were intent on retaining as much of the original wood and plaster detailing as possible so that the new kitchen would pair seamlessly with the rest of the prewar apartment.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen, landmark townhouse, white cabinets, pendant lights" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-kitchen-space-white-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="white open kitchen space with white kitchen cabinets and brown dining table after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pantry cabinet next to the sink got a makeover; the glass panels had either been replaced with plywood or painted over, so they had new glass put in. It now makes a nice display for cookbooks and spices. &#8220;We believe that before the addition was put on the back of the house, that door would have been the exterior door to the yard,&#8221; said Kate. Demo revealed that the molding and flooring had continued throughout the original space as they predicted. The new layout also allowed more light into the rest of the apartment.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" title="white-overhead-kitchen-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="white overhead kitchen cabinets over white quartz counter and open shelves after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="wide-doorway-white-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="wide doorway to a white kitchen space with white cabinets and pendant lights after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kate and Graham chose integrated appliances for a built-in look. Given that the kitchen is now in plain view from the rest of the apartment, they did not want it “to scream ‘kitchen,’” explained Kate. The refrigerator replaces what used to be a closet and looks as if it has always been there, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disguised by a cabinet front</a>. They attempted to minimize stainless steel with hardware and cabinet choices that were “understated, practical, and looked more like built-in furniture.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-06-723x1085.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-cabinets-small-white-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="white cabinets and a small white counter along with brown dining table after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While quartz was chosen for the backsplash and countertops around the stove and sink for its durability, they softened up the space by topping the oversized island with butcher block. The wood floors were sanded and refinished for continuity with the rest of the home.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-08.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-cabinets-white-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-08.gif" alt="white cabinets and a white counter on a brown vinyl floor after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinetry</a> was the most expensive choice that Kate and Graham made, but they &#8220;were committed to this expense from the beginning because [they] knew it was the only way to maximize storage space and because the cabinets are by far the most prominent feature of the kitchen,&#8221; said Kate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because they did not use an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/when-do-you-need-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect</a>, there was quite a bit of &#8220;game-time decision-making&#8221; that slowed things down. Now that the project is finished, however, the whole family loves the space. “The kids show off the fact that the fridge and microwave are hidden behind doors to everyone who comes over. We all spend most of our together-time in the kitchen now,&#8221; said Kate. &#8220;And when people come over, it&#8217;s where everyone inevitably ends up hanging out.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: By hiding ductwork behind the upper cabinets, the couple was able to remove the drop ceiling in the kitchen to gain more height in the space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">A house taps into a modern vibe with a pot-filler, farmhouse sink and appliance garage</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23868 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Romuald had a dream: he wanted to live in a loft apartment. His current home, a 1,800-square-foot house in Elmhurst, was definitely <em>not</em> a loft, but it was ideal for him and his wife in many other ways. It was close to both of their jobs, as well as to both sets of parents, and they loved having a backyard right off the kitchen. So they decided to do the next best thing: make their home as &#8220;loft-like&#8221; as a house could be, most notably opening </span><span class="s1">up walls so the space would have an airy feel. Finally, it came time to tackle the tight, closed-off kitchen. Here are the details on a long-awaited kitchen renovation (and a few extras!) befitting two avid cooks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23870 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-Before-01-723x482.jpg" alt="loft apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23862 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="loft apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23860 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-01" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23865" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-09-10" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">After living in his home for close to ten years, Romuald knew that a new kitchen could dramatically change how his family used the space. He and his wife love cooking together, so they wanted to create a new kitchen in which two (or more!) people could comfortably work. Upon his wife&#8217;s recommendation, he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">turned to Sweeten</span></a> for help and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his <span class="s2">contractor</span></a> for the project. The original kitchen featured dark wood cabinets and felt cave-like because of a wall separating it from the main living space. Wanting to demolish the wall, it was necessary to regain the storage space by adding an island. It also afforded an extra work surface and an unobstructed sightline across the whole first floor of the house for a loft apartment feel. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Working with their contractor, the couple came up with a plan for their new kitchen. The original flooring was a tile that contrasted with the hardwood running through the rest of the first floor. They wanted to continue the wood look but opted for a gray “wood” porcelain that would be much easier to maintain (important for a kitchen that sees a lot of action!). <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semi-custom cabinets</a> made it possible for creative storage solutions like an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221; (details below) to be incorporated into the kitchen plan. The warm gray cabinets they chose from <a href="https://www.waypointlivingspaces.com/cabinets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Waypoint</span></a> coordinated with the new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a>. A white quartz countertop and classic marble subway tile for the backsplash brought a clean yet contrasting look. Above the stove, they installed a pot-filler to save the job of hauling a heavy pot of water from the sink on the island to the stovetop.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-11-12.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23866 mb-0 size-chrono" title="microwave" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-11-12.gif" alt="microwave" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Romuald and his wife started shopping around to replace all of their appliances with the exception of their investment appliance—a <a href="https://www.thermador.com/us/products/ranges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Thermador</span></a> range with blue knobs. After visiting appliance stores and making product choices,  he came across one of his favorite finds—the microwave drawer! A built-in microwave was placed high on their wish list so that it wouldn’t take up valuable counter space like their previous one did. When he came across the drawer, he knew that it was the way to go. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Next, their Sweeten contractor suggested the genius solution of an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221;—a much-loved-but-seldom-seen feature in city apartments. This storage unit would house their toaster, coffeemaker, as well as a few odds and ends, with outlets built into the back keeping a tangle of cords contained. With the “garage door” lowered, the counters would look instantly cleaner.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">In the spot where a dividing wall originally stood, they installed an island. While they had intended to build one about six feet long, it ultimately expanded to a 10-foot-long island—a decision that Romuald doesn’t regret one bit. “We can fit four stools along one side, while the other side has enough space for our farmhouse sink, microwave drawer, and dishwasher—and with storage room, too!” Given the space now has the open feel of a loft apartment, they can now watch the TV in their living room from the kitchen. Romuald explains, “We have it on a swivel, so we just swing it around and can cook and watch TV at the same time. This is great for unwinding after a long day’s work.” They also love the way that the breeze flows through the entire space when they open the door to the backyard—something that wasn’t possible with walls in the way.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">While the project took a bit longer than anticipated due to delays in delivery of materials, Romuald reports that they are very happy with the way it all turned out. And although they had intended on just renovating the kitchen, the project expanded in the end to include new floors throughout the entire living space, as well as a new railing for the stairs leading to the second floor of their house. All of these changes have made their house a dream home for the couple!</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Carroll Gardens homeowner Kim Solop </span></i></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After ten years of living in our Carroll Gardens condo, we really needed a change. We contemplated a move to the suburbs or upgrading to a bigger place in a less popular Brooklyn neighborhood. After almost a year of looking and being priced out in our current neighborhood, we decided to renovate our current place, a two-bed, two-bath, 1,200 square-foot condo that we bought in 2006. We loved our current neighborhood with its proximity to our workplaces, lots of cute restaurants, shops, and our two sons’ schools. The problems were in the apartment itself: I was unhappy with the dark kitchen—I always had been. I love taking baths but hated the jet tub that was installed over a decade ago. Lastly, our laundry closet had a lot of wasted space and I wanted to add a walk-in pantry!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a big fan of home decor blogs, I had been stalking the Sweeten site for a while, and really loved seeing the transformations that the contractors could do with space. I was excited for the chance to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/15462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our renovation</a>. I met with a couple of them, and decided on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>. I really clicked with the project managers and could see that we would have a good partnership.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My main objective for the kitchen was to brighten it up and eliminate the space between the cabinets and the ceiling. I hated how this wasted space looked and the amount of dust it collected. After a few weeks of sourcing materials, we were ready to go! I knew from the get-go that I wanted a white kitchen, as well as shaker-style cabinets with quartz countertops that were marble look-alikes. Other than that, I was pretty open to ideas. Our contractor came over with a wealth of ideas for how we could open the kitchen up to maximize light. (Unfortunately, there are no windows in the kitchen, so there was only so much we could do.) I debated another set of cabinets on top of the current ones, but eventually decided against it. I switched gears a bit on the white color palette, choosing instead a dual-tone kitchen with white uppers and gray lower cabinets. After living with long pulls, I decided to go with smaller handles on all the cabinetry. Quartz countertops were also a must, for the durability factor! With two kids and a husband who are not always the neatest, I knew that we needed a tough work surface. I was adamant about getting a wine fridge. As members of a few wine clubs, we struggled to find space to keep our wine at the right temperatures.</p>

<p>Our microwave above the range was replaced with a microwave drawer, and a hood was installed above the stovetop instead. With the new wine fridge taking up precious cabinet space, I did lose a place for pots and pans. Our contractor was able to give me deep drawers in the pantry to make up for this lost storage. My other kitchen must-haves were a deep, white porcelain sink, and an under-counter pull-out garbage can.</p>

<p>Across the kitchen was a room that held just the washer and dryer with inaccessible space that was wasted. When we extended the wall, there was room for a customized pantry with countertops, shelving, and cabinetry that matched the kitchen. After not having a pantry for so long, it’s amazing to have one, and the additional space has really been a lifesaver. I had envisioned barn doors, but there was not enough wall space for it. The double doors we ended up hanging looked so plain and boring. I had some wallpaper left over from the hallway&#8211;so I went for it and covered the doors too. I think it turned out nicely.</p>

<p>For the bathroom, I wanted a totally new look that was modern and clean. We went with dark floors, a deep soaking tub, and a floating vanity. Our contractor showed me a picture of another bathroom he did, and I loved it so much, we copied it almost exactly. It came out perfectly and I am fighting my older son almost daily for baths! The tub is divine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We actually lived in the space during the whole renovation, which lasted about seven weeks. It was definitely challenging and required a lot of patience. The contractor and his crew were great about cleaning up, however, and we made the best of it with lots of takeout dinners.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading the Sweeten blog for so many years, it was exciting to embark on my own renovation. I realized that renovating is messy and dirty, and almost always takes longer than you had originally anticipated. You learn to roll with the punches, and realize that things happen. We had a few hiccups along the way, such as wanting the barn door on the pantry that wasn’t going to work, so I learned to compromise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoyed working with our Sweeten contractor,  who made himself available at all hours. He was in constant communication and has remained a friend to this day. We love our new kitchen and other improvements, and are planning on staying to enjoy them for many years to come!</span></p>
