										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re back in Brooklyn for round two of Chris and Amber’s home renovation! Last week, Chris shared a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/chris-and-ambers-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">detailed account of their lovely kitchen renovation</a>, and this week we’re lucky enough to get another tour featuring two vitally important areas of their Ditmas Park home. Read on for a new take on how they made way for a second bedroom and squeezed in a full bathroom renovation, all just in time to welcome a new baby!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/chris-ambers-bathroom-kids-room-renovation/"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17257" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/amber-bathroom.jpg" alt="ditmas park bathroom renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/amber-bathroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/amber-bathroom-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
Guest post by Chris, Ditmas Park homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During construction, many people, not least of all our immediate neighbors, asked us why we were renovating our apartment. In the earliest stages, we would say, semi-seriously, that all we had really intended to do before things got out of control was put in a dishwasher. We had quickly realized that re-doing our kitchen was going to be an all or nothing endeavor for us and putting in a dishwasher somehow became ripping our kitchen down to bare studs. But once we found out that our second kid was on the way, the focus of the project became carving out a room for our older son that was just big enough to be useful, but small enough to keep the kitchen a reasonable size. After <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting our project on Sweeten</a> and meeting <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these Sweeten general contractors</a>, we went full steam ahead with their innovative design for our kitchen and new kids&#8217; room.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17271 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17258" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten general contractors understood that we needed to be able to fit a standard-sized crib along one of the crved walls, and that if push came to shove we could alternatively squeeze in a standard twin bed running the other way, just in case we end up staying in the apartment for quite a while longer than we’ve planned. We kept the curved walls of the room as they were since it is a nice pre-war touch that conveys the fact that the room juts out into the facade of the building, forming a miniature bay window with a tiny balcony for plants. We laid a new wood floor and installed a heavy door that swings open to be flush against the wall outside the room, almost making it disappear when it’s open. The other thing that makes it feel so much bigger is that there is a full transom milk glass window along the top of the doorway. It brings light into the kitchen and keeps the partition between the kitchen and our son’s room from dominating.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17184" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-13-14.gif" alt="kids room" width="600" height="401" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We only finished the last details of our son’s room a couple months ago: a series of picture shelves from Pottery Barn that we painted to match the walls, a roller blind, and a cheap but cheerful rug from Land of Nod. Honestly, it was knowing that Sweeten was sending a photographer that made us pull it all together!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Halfway through renovating the kitchen, we realized that if we didn’t do the bathroom, it was never going to happen. Our apartment and our lives had already been turned upside down and we knew we were never going to go through it again. The former bathroom had tiling that ran up the sides of the walls which created a tub effect and everything felt very tired and shabby.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We installed large dark gray tiles, replaced the old tub with a Kohler cast iron model, and redid the shower stall which is separate from the bath in clean simple narrow subway tiles from Nemo. The sink and vanity are from IKEA. We raised the ceiling of the stall and installed a ceiling light which makes all the difference. All the fixtures are Grohe, good bang for the buck and they toe the line between modern and classic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17252 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-02-1.jpg" alt="walk-in shower" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-02-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-02-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17251" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-01-1.jpg" alt="all-white bathroom remodel" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-01-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every project ends with a few things that you never quite get to and our wall light in the bathroom is one of them. We kept it in the original spot which is centered on the wall but not over the medicine cabinet. Our contractor was happy to move it but in our hurry to move back in with a two-week-old baby we figured we could live with it. Even now, every time I flip on the light I think of how amazing it felt to be back in the apartment after the work was done, so, I am happy to leave it where it is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Marble tiles, a sleek pocket door, and new laundry facilities round out this Upper East Side bathroom</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-laura-and-peters-uptown-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14709 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/laurabathroom.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/laurabathroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/laurabathroom-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Laura and Peter bought their one-bedroom, one-bathroom co-op on Manhattan’s Upper East Side in 2013. During the apartment hunt, this arts professional and consultant pair decided they really wanted a home with an in-unit washer and dryer. Some buildings allowed washers and dryers and some did not. Still others had flip-flopped on the­­­ matter altogether: buildings that once allowed in-unit washers and dryers later changed their minds—grandfathering in appliances installed before the change while banning newcomers from adding them. When Laura and Peter sealed the deal on their new place in a building that allowed laundry appliances, the hustle was on to install a set pronto, before any potential shift down the road.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>“Our expert team was so helpful &#8212; Ed and Valeria did a lot of really beautiful work and were easy to get in touch with while we weren&#8217;t living there. Ed was excellent about working with our building and super and they both helped with photos and phone calls whenever we had delivery issues, which was often.”<span id="more-14708"></span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><em>&#8212; Laura, Upper East Side homeowner</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laura and Peter eyed a hallway closet as the future home of their laundry nook, but the plan took on a choose your own adventure angle as the couple needed help to determine whether the work might necessitate opening the walls in the kitchen or bath, both adjacent to the laundry spot. Laura was also plagued by the daily reminder that the bathroom had no nearby heat source. With floor-to-ceiling travertine tiles, it felt like a Tuscan-inspired igloo on chilly mornings. Plus, the extra-wide pedestal sink put the shower tap just out of her reach – an unfortunate design flaw in an otherwise compact room. Laura <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted the project on Sweeten</a> and we introduced Sweeten Experts Valeria and Eduard, owners of a Brooklyn design-build firm, to make this all work. Valeria and Eduard cut through the walls to make the call that the new laundry closet would share water access with the bathroom, meaning game on for a full bathroom renovation!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14714" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-Before-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-Before-05" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-Before-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-Before-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Laura drew inspiration from the iconic black and white tile in so many bathrooms she toured while apartment-hunting. In went white marble floor tiles accented with miniature black diamond tiles, all from <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>. This ageless flooring masks a big-time modern improvement: radiant floor heating lies just underneath and is connected to a timer that gets the heat going every morning. Laura and Peter continued a luxe look up the walls with 12” marble square tiles, a subtle rounded tile border, and custom marble shower shelves, all with materials found at <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom gained a sleek pocket door (with beautifully crafted custom molding created by Eduard) and Laura found a console sink that combined the look of an old-fashioned marble sink with more modern chrome lines. The couple found multiple ways to echo these clean lines with a simple squared  <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler tub</a> and sliding glass doors, European-inspired <a href="https://www.americanstandard-us.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Standard shower fixtures</a>, a dual-flush toilet from <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler</a>, and a deco lighting fixture sourced from Lighting District. Valeria and Eduard also made room for a <a href="https://shop.panasonic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Panasonic</a> ceiling fan and side-by-side <a href="https://www.robern.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robern medicine cabinets</a>, both mirrored inside and out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All together, the new space is brighter and warmer than ever before. And the washer and dryer that started it all? The contractors transformed the interior of the hallway closet with blue-gray paint and stacked a white <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bosch washer and dryer</a> next to revamped hallway linen storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This week, we have a full bathroom renovation guest report in from Celeste G., a condo owner and marketing, brand building, and copywriting triple threat in Park Slope. Read on down for Celeste’s debrief on her Brooklyn bathroom before and after!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14659 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/celestebathroom2.jpg" alt="celeste park slope bathroom" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/celestebathroom2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/celestebathroom2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Homeowner guest post by Celeste G., Park Slope homeowner<span id="more-14416"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I purchased my one bedroom condo in Park Slope in 2008. It was new construction, which was great because I am the exact opposite of handy or DIY. The “design” of the apartment was standard for new construction buildings at the time: bamboo floors, limestone tile, and dark cherry cabinetry. I lived in the apartment for a few years before considering any cosmetic changes and around year three, I noticed that the limestone tiles in my bathroom had darkened in some spots. In fact, the tile had never been sealed and as I learned the hard way, limestone is extremely porous. Several failed cleaning experiments later, I had nearly ruined the color and texture of a small patch near the sink vanity. As a clean enthusiast, the sight of the floor drove me bananas, but I wasn’t ready to take on what felt like an overwhelming renovation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14446" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-011.png" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-01" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-011.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-011-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, I decided to replace all the bamboo floors in my apartment (why start small when practically moving out of your home is an option?!). Luckily this foray into renovation was successful and the change in flooring literally changed the entire look and feel of the whole place. I felt confident tackling my tiny bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did some research on what I might spend (why are toilets so expensive???) and asked my friends for contractor recommendations. My building required contractors with a certain amount of insurance, so I started looking beyond friend recommendations and luckily landed on Sweeten. I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a> and was matched with three contractors including <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a>. All I knew for sure was that I liked the idea of a gray/black/white graphical floor, and I definitely needed more storage space because clutter makes my eyes swim &#8212; during our first meeting, I felt that Paulina understood the general aesthetic I was interested in and suggested a number of possibilities to open up the small-ish space. I sent her a few pictures from Pinterest and she developed 3D models based on my bathroom’s measurements. For someone spatially challenged, the modeling was enormously helpful. I could see the transformation and make adjustments before touching a thing. For example, we initially thought gold hardware would elevate the bathroom’s overall look but once I saw it in the model, I opted to go with chrome instead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once we were decided on the 3D model, Paulina sourced floor and wall samples and sent me a photo of the type of wood planned for a custom vanity. I presented a lot of options to her and relied on her expertise for guidance. For example, a friend of mine replaced her bathroom sinks with <a href="https://www.corian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corian surfaces</a> and I really liked the seamlessness of it. I shared a photo with Paulina and she designed the sink and vanity with a beautiful, white Corian top, complete with side cutouts to add some dimension and visual interest. Honestly, I was unsure about the cutouts initially but after seeing it in the 3D model, I decided to give it a whirl.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14447" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-011.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-01" width="600" height="890" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-011.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-011-202x300.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14448" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-021.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-021.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-021-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main challenge with this bathroom was the lack of storage space. I asked Paulina for a deep medicine cabinet along with a good amount of storage space in the vanity. I got my wish in spades. As we were discussing options, I pointed out that there was no place for a trash bin. Paulina worked it into the design of the vanity so not only do I have space for a small trash bin, it’s also completely hidden from view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original inspiration for the renovation was again, the floor. I fell in love with a cement tile in a M.C. Escher-like pattern. Paulina ordered samples for us to review but expressed some second thoughts about the durability and appearance of that tile. Maybe two or three days later, she emailed me to say that she was concerned about this particular pick and suggested I look at some marble tile with a similar pattern at a showroom nearby. I’m so glad I took her up on it. The marble option, from <a href="https://www.walkerzanger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walker Zanger</a> (in Facet Ash), was not only more in line with the aesthetic I wanted but also less expensive and more durable. I kept my original tub and <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Bathroom-Toilets/category/429984/429204.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler toilet</a>, and framed the room in a new beveled, white subway tile. I kept the walls white and Paulina’s team installed a <a href="https://www.minkagroup.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minka-Lavery Downtown Edison lighting fixture</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14449" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-031.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-031.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-031-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The two weeks of actual renovation are a blur to me now. They seemed to go by very quickly and yet take forever. I was close enough to check on progress every day and Paulina’s team really did work fast. The transformation was fun to watch, even though I admittedly had a few panicked moments and doubts about the chair rail tile (why do I even know what this is?) and the vanity. I remember one email I sent Paulina after the vanity was installed. I spent maybe 10-15 minutes in the bathroom while it was still under construction trying to get the drawers to the vanity open, and then emailed to ask if the drawers would be easier to open when the bathroom was finished. It didn’t occur to me that the pulls hadn’t been installed yet. Thankfully, Paulina has a good sense of humor…!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few months later and I still love my new bathroom. When I think back to that stained limestone tile and cherry wood vanity, I can’t believe it took me seven years to switch it up.</p>
