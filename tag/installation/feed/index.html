										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">The lowdown on wood flooring options—solid, engineered, reclaimed—and how to choose</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20504 size-chrono" title="hardwood flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg" alt="sweeten_rima_hardwood_flooring-10" width="723" height="482" /></a>(Above) Rima installed mid-sized <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/rimas-ikea-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plank engineered wood</a> with a matte finish throughout her home.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Of all the surface options available for the home, hardwood flooring remains the one with the most cachet and value. After all, it&#8217;s warm in appearance, easy underfoot (especially compared to tile or stone), versatile in application thanks to the range of wood species and finishes available, and innately luxurious. From solid to engineered to salvaged, you’re likely to find an option that suits your home’s style as well as your lifestyle.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Wood flooring prices can vary greatly, depending on where the flooring was manufactured, how it was made, how it was finished, and who’s installing it. Base your decision on where the floor will go, and what type of activity those rooms will see. Flooring is an investment—of resources and the time it takes to install it. Make the right choice, and you will enjoy your wood floor for probably as long as you want it.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Consider your lifestyle</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">First, examine what the room or room(s) will be used for, how much traffic they will experience, and what kind. Wood can be enjoyed throughout most homes, with a few precautions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Will there be pets scratching it with their nails? </span><span class="s1">High heels from frequent entertaining? </span><span class="s1">Toys from energetic little ones?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Do you expect grit consistently tracked from the front door or backyard? </span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does the room get loads of sunlight that could fade the surface in some areas? </span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Is there the possibility of accidental yet prolonged exposure to water, next to a dishwasher or by a bathtub, which could cause the floor to swell? </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Today’s hardwood flooring often features highly durable polyurethane coatings that are formulated to stand up to light or average wear, but you will need to commit yourself to a regular maintenance routine in order to keep the surface beautiful. And engineered versions, with a wood veneer backed by a composite that helps assure its stability (while slightly lowering the cost compared to its solid wood cousin), can sometimes go in environments that experience some moisture, like a basement or a bathroom.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27034 size-chrono" title="engineered wood flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="hardwood flooring" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) Throughout Tom and Alex&#8217;s apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/mid-century-mad-men-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engineered wood</a> replaced old parquet floors.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Customize the look</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Each species of wood has its own color and grain, and the choice is yours. Appearance has expanded beyond classic wood species and stains to include colored washes and dramatic textures added during manufacturing, from classic satin to wire-brushed to scraped. These distressed effects also serve to hide some wear over time as well as enhance character. Dimensions vary, too, from traditional narrow strips to wide planks that lend a rustic mood and also means fewer seams into the overall floor.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The hardness of the wood should be taken into account, too. If your floor will see a lot of action, you want one of the harder species, like oak, maple, or hickory. The ranking system for hardness among different species, called the Janka hardness test, measures how a wood stands up to dents and wear. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Finishes affect the overall style, with a range of high, medium, or low gloss available from most manufacturers, depending on whether you want a highly polished or a more satiny effect. The finish, applied in anywhere from three to seven coats, should include aluminum oxide to make it resistant to the abrasions of daily foot traffic. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Click-lock versus tongue-and-groove</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Edge treatments vary widely to give you plenty of options to achieve the look you want, from square to beveled to scraped to pillowed. Wood floors connect one edge to another by means of two methods: </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Like the term implies, click-lock boards click into place to provide an almost seamless appearance, except for the grain of the wood. Found in engineered wood flooring, these require no adhesive and so the installation tends to go faster.</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The tongue-and-groove method fits together using a thin piece on one long side that fits into the grooved indenture on the adjoining board’s side. Planks are further secured when nailed, glued, or laid in a floating installation. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28816" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02-1-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />(Above) Dark walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardwood flooring</a> in Jonathan and Cecilia&#8217;s home adds richness and a sense of depth to their space.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Get real with solid hardwood</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solid hardwood</a> comes either factory-finished or can be finished on site. Factory-finished flooring arrives needing only to be installed, making it clean and quick to lay down. This method eliminates or reduces the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The curing that site-finished wood requires (which can take up to two months as the wood adjusts to your home’s climate)</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Dust from sanding</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Chemical fumes from the finish</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Length of time from start of installation to complete drying of finish</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Length of time to final use of room</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The finish is also cured under UV lights at the factory, a process that can’t happen on site, so the factory-finish is likely tougher than the one applied on site. This floor should also include a warranty from the manufacturer instead of the installer. The main benefit of having a site-finished floor is if you desire total control over the final look. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Factory-finished floors typically arrive already topped with several layers of a water- or oil-based polyurethane coating that incorporates aluminum oxide to protect the wood from scratches and fading due to sunlight. A clear top coat provides the glossy or satin appearance. This floor can be refinished several times until the multilayer coating is completely removed, which then means reapplying the finish or, in extreme situations, replacing the plank. If your floor is finished on site, discuss with the installer what type of finish he recommends, and if it includes aluminum oxide.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Caution: Solid wood is a natural material, making it vulnerable to swings in temperature and humidity. Because it will expand and contract, it must be fastened to a subfloor but not concrete, so it can’t go below-grade or in damp areas like a basement or a bath that gets lots of steam.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28813 size-chrono" title="engineered wood floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="hardwood flooring" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engineered wood</a> finished with a natural veneer pairs well with exposed brick in Miguel&#8217;s bedroom.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Fool the eye with engineered wood</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If it looks like it’s real wood, that’s because it is—a veneer of real wood atop a structural base, typically plywood. The base gives it added stability so it can go in a bath or a basement, as well as over radiant heating elements. It requires fewer trees than solid hardwood, but the base includes glues that bind the plywood and the veneer. This option is easy to install as a floating floor or it can be secured with staples or glue. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Expect to find all the classic species of woods and stains in this engineered wood category, as well as some fun fashion colors like a gray wash. You’ll discover a range of quality, too, so when shopping, investigate the thickness of the veneer, the number of protective coatings, and the number of ply in the base, which can range from three to seven and up. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Refinishing engineered wood is far more limited than solid wood—as little as once, depending on the thickness of the veneer. Buy an extra box in the event you need to replace a plank, so you don’t have to worry about matching. Ask about warranties for both the finish and veneer delamination.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Go authentic with reclaimed wood</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Probably the most environmentally-friendly choice, reclaimed wood that is salvaged from old buildings requires no cutting of trees. Its unique appeal comes from its original sourcing, which may be domestic woods that are now rare or unavailable for residential use. Like a vintage wine, reclaimed wood also shows a character that can’t be reproduced today, even from advanced manufacturing techniques. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This wood is typically sourced from old factories, deconstructed homes, old decking or piers, but it still has to be treated to go into its new home. It may be warped or cracked in areas, and so require some milling before it’s ready for installation. Make sure the wood is kiln-dried after milling, as this will aid its stability and also eliminate the possibility of critters, such as termites. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This category can be found from a few national dealers, like Mountain Lumber, or locally by doing a search online, but if you shop from an independent dealer, make sure he or she guarantees the product.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Consider maintenance and repair </b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The biggest enemy of your wood floor is nearly invisible grit tracked in on shoes. Place area rugs or mats at entry points to catch dirt. Try to sweep or vacuum daily, clean monthly with a wood floor cleaner recommended by the manufacturer, so you can enjoy your floor for a lifetime.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Westchester County </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no doubt that Westchester is a picturesque place to live—the luxury of space and peace with the bustle of New York City a quick trip away. Some recent buyers and established homeowners alike feel it would be even more idyllic if they had their dream kitchen, whether it&#8217;s renovating a new home or fulfilling a long-desired wish to upgrade. The first step is often the stumbling block: determining the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/kitchen-renovation-costs-money-goes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">national average</a> for a basic 200-square-foot kitchen renovation is $63,829.  Westchester County has a slightly higher average <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation cost</a> landing at <strong>$65,651</strong> or <strong>$328 a square foot</strong>, according to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association (NKBA). Let’s break that budget down into bite-sized pieces to help you get closer to your dream cooking and entertaining space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DESIGN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an important line item in your budget, especially if your vision involves a layout change. That could involve moving load-bearing walls and gas lines. The NKBA estimates design fees eat up about four percent of a kitchen remodel cost. Sweeten designer <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, who has done work in Westchester, said it&#8217;s more realistic to put away 15 percent of your budget for design if you’re in the mood for a major layout change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re giving your kitchen more of a makeover than an overhaul, it’s possible to work closely with an experienced general contractor on the design and forgo a designer. Statistics from the NKBA show that the majority of homeowners relied on a general contractor and only 22 percent used a designer. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck</a>, a Sweeten contractor who works in Westchester, has found that many clients in the county take a hands-on approach to design and often don’t use a designer or architect. However, an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect&#8217;s services will be needed</a> if plumbing or gas lines are moving, there are structural changes, or if a landmark property is being renovated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PERMITS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building permits are handled by the building department of each individual town within Westchester County. &#8220;Individual&#8221; is the key word here because methods of calculations can change dramatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Rye, the most of the <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/money/real-estate/homes/2017/03/22/westchester-priciest-zipcodes/99506058/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive</a> area in Southern Westchester—the median price for a home is $1,380,000—it’s no surprise that building permits are calculated based on the cost of a renovation. For every $1,000 in your kitchen remodel budget, that’s an additional $17 for your building permits. That average $64,000 kitchen overhaul will cost at least $1,088 in permits. If plumbing and electrical permits are required, that’s an additional $200 a pop (for a less extensive renovation, these permits may not be necessary).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the township of Peekskill, building permit costs are at the end of a minor mathematical equation. Multiply the square footage of your project by $150. Then, multiply that figure by 0.10. For a 200-square-foot kitchen, that’s $3,000. So take a moment to look at how the building department of your township calculates permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/westchester-county-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-34831 size-full" title="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png" alt="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" width="320" height="60" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png 320w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>APPLIANCES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Village Appliances in Westchester, a budget appliance package (fridge, oven, dishwasher and microwave), can go for under $5,000. However, Joe Gagliardo, the owner of Village Appliances, doesn’t sell too many of those. The majority of customers either go for a package in the $5,000 to $8,000 range or in the mid-price range of $18,000 to $22,000, which will get you brands such as General Electric and Electrolux. The high-end price spectrum will deliver brands such as Viking and Miele for a four-piece suite (fridge, range, hood, and dishwasher) at a price ranging from $17,000 to $26,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At <a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bilotta Kitchens</a>, clients often buy in the $12,000 to $15,000 range for an appliance package, according to senior designer and CKD Randy O’Kane. This will get you brands such as Thermador, Sub-Zero, and Wolf. There’s always room to mix and match, but brands do offer a discount or throw in items like blenders, toasters and hoods for free if you go with the same brand for your appliances, Randy said. “It is the heart and soul of a kitchen,” she said. “Cabinets are great, but it is all about cooking.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation can cost between $500 and $1,000, and that price will depend on how much work your contractor has already done. If water lines have not been run or outlets are not in the necessary areas, that could push up installation costs, Joe said. For those after custom range hoods, then plan for the $2,000 and $8,000 range.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CABINETS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinets and hardware (think handles and knobs) are a big-ticket item on every kitchen remodel cost budget. They typically take up 30 percent of costs, according to NKBA. In a basic kitchen renovation, that’s $6,000. For a major overhaul worth $60,000, cabinets cost almost $20,000. What typically makes a big <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difference in cabinet cost</a> is whether you want custom, pre-fabricated or a mix of both. Something pre-fabricated from IKEA or Home Depot will cost around $130 a linear foot. Custom jobs can shoot up to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear square foot</a>. However, with that higher price, there is more freedom in deciding your kitchen layout. You can also get <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a> with custom cabinets. Semi-custom cabinets generally are about 50 percent cheaper than full custom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or do what Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill did in her own kitchen renovation: the recycled customized option. &#8220;I scoured Renovation Angel&#8217;s website and purchased a used-but-high-end kitchen for about $10,000, which is what I could have spent on cabinets alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A complete kitchen included appliances and cabinetry.&#8221; Jean then customized the cabinets to fit her space, which often meant filler panels were wider on one side than the other, or building a soffit was necessary. &#8220;It was like working on a jigsaw puzzle in order to make the kitchen look like it fit in the space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I was okay with these kinds of imperfections in exchange for essentially getting a premium kitchen on an Ikea type of budget.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>COUNTERTOPS</strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.westchesterkitchenandbath.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester Kitchen and Bath</a>, quartz is overwhelmingly the most popular countertop, according to showroom manager and designer Donna Magnotta. “It’s heat-, stain-, scratch-, and bacteria-resistant,” she said, “and it&#8217;s maintenance-free.” Natural stones, like marble, need routine staining and sealing. Quartz starts around $85 per linear foot and is on the mid to high-end of the price scale, which includes the cost of fabricating and installing. Laminate starts at $20 a linear foot, but is rarely purchased, Donna said. Granite is next up the ladder at about $35 a linear foot. On the high end, natural stones start at about $120 a linear foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LIGHTING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kitchen lighting isn’t a big budget line item. It takes up on four percent of total costs on average. The end price, of course, will always be determined by your tastes. In a $20,000 kitchen, that’s only $800. For a major remodel in the $60,000 range, lighting costs look closer to $2,400.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PLUMBING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On an average remodel, plumbing costs are about the same at $800. If there is a layout change to your Westchester kitchen, then that will likely add to your plumbing costs, which also includes gas lines. And the more you alter the basic layout of your space, the more your kitchen remodel cost will increase for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting, and inspections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FLOORING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a budget, Westchester’s <a href="https://suburbanfloors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suburban Floors</a> has a vinyl Karndean-Knight Tile that is $3.50 a square foot that is “still very durable and stylish,” said Emily Carpentieri, the store’s owner. The price per square foot does not include installation. On the higher end is cork or wide-plank wood flooring. These go for $8.25 to $15 a square foot. But vinyl floors in the $5 to $7 range is Suburban Floors’ biggest seller. “These would blow your mind how real they looked,” said Emily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LABOR AND INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction labor can change depending upon your Westchester zip code. The costs are less expensive the further you are from NYC. For Peekskill, labor costs are 22 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr.com</a>. Dobbs Ferry comes in at 40 percent higher and Croton-on-Hudson at 27 percent higher than the national average. The kitchen renovation cost in Rye could have a labor budget 55 percent above the national average. To compare, the labor cost for a kitchen renovation on the Upper East Side is 77 percent higher than the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t forget installation for appliances, cabinetry, plumbing, and electrical. These typically take about 17 percent of a budget, which is about $3,500 for an average kitchen. And as mentioned above, factor in $500 to $1,000 for appliance installation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, renovations are like fingerprints<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no two are alike. That includes their budgets. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator in Westchester allocated their $56,620 renovation budget:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22777 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg" alt="Modern kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel and Eric&#8217;s kitchen</a> in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine cooking in your new kitchen for the first time&#8230;the style! The smart layout! The shiny new appliances and lovely lighting! The team at Sweeten is inspired daily by our clients’ posts describing their renovation dreams, and the best place to start the process is with a realistic budget. Sweeten&#8217;s guide will help you learn what to expect for kitchen renovation costs.</p>
<h3>Average kitchen renovation costs in the U.S.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The national average for a basic kitchen renovation is <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$22,000</a> and swings up to about $60,000 for a major overhaul. What if your desires exceed your bank account? Tweaking the budget so your project comes within your price range while maintaining quality begins with understanding the cost breakdown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen design costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association&#8217;s (NKBA) estimates design fees will comprise about four percent of your budget. Although this percentage could grow. For example, a kitchen designer in NYC might cost 15 percent of that budget, says <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, a Sweeten designer. The NKBA also found that only 22 percent of homeowners renovating a kitchen or a bathroom actually hired a designer. Instead, many chose to work closely with an experienced general contractor on their design to bring down the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just remember that your design will play a big role in the end budget. If you’re dreaming of a layout change that involves moving load-bearing walls and gas lines, take into account the additional paperwork, inspections, and fees later on.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Appliances</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The more you value your cooking skills, the sooner you should make your budget decisions in this category. “If the client falls in love with a 48-inch range, the designer can fit that into the design,” explains Jace Kieffer from <a href="https://www.kieffers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kieffer’s Appliances</a> in Lansdale, PA. Your appliance and ventilation choices may impact the design, he adds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a starter home, a basic four-appliance kitchen set—range, fridge, microwave and dishwasher—costs around $2,000. However, if you’re renovating a kitchen, it’s likely you will want to upgrade to at least premium economy appliances. They cost between $4,000 and $5,000 and have a life expectancy of about seven years. Luxury brands will set you back at least $12,000, a cost that should be weighed against their 15-year life expectancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Across the country, you’re unlikely to see much variation in the cost of luxury appliances. That’s because manufacturers often put minimum price restrictions on their appliances (sorry, no Black Friday deals here). If you’re happy with a lower grade, it might be worth shopping around for a sweeter price.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Ventilation</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like appliances, it is helpful to factor ventilation into the plans early. A basic over-the-range hood that leaves room for the microwave goes for around $300. A standalone hood from a premium economy brand costs $500 or more. A luxury brand might set you back about $2,000. Customs hoods from a metal fabricator can cost upwards of $10,000, Jace said. You also need to plan for ducting, which a general contractor usually takes care of.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Cabinets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest investment of your kitchen renovation will likely be cabinetry and hardware (such as handles and knobs)&#8211;this category typically makes up about 30 percent of budgets. A big factor in pricing will be your preference for custom or pre-fabricated cabinets from stores like Home Depot and IKEA. Stock cabinets average out at about $130 for a linear foot. For a custom job, the price might be as much as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear foot</a>. Custom cabinets will give you greater freedom when deciding your kitchen layout and finished look. It could also get you <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a>. Don’t forget that these cabinets must be installed and that will likely be an additional cost. See more on labor and installation below.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an area where you can scrimp or splurge, depending on your priorities. Countertops can start at $5 per square foot for a butcher’s block or laminate, a synthetic material. A low-end quartz could cost about $50 a square foot and a marble around $60 a square foot. Something more pricey such as granite could cost as much as $100 a square foot. Don’t forget to factor in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backsplash</a>, which is the wall area between the countertop and cabinets. That could range from $3 a square foot to $35.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Floors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Flooring will represent 7 percent of an average budget, or about $1,400, according to the NKBA. Concrete or vinyl flooring are economical choices and can look cool along with being easy to clean. Stone or wood flooring are higher-end options. Keep in mind that new base cabinets that are a different depth than your original may expose old and mismatched flooring.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lighting in the kitchen</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is generally a lower-spend category. In a $20,000 budget, lighting materials usually come in at about $800. Again, this will move up or down depending on your tastes. Besides ventilation, those remodeling their kitchens spent the least on lighting, according to the NKBA.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen plumbing costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like everything else in renovating, your vision and choices will have a big impact on kitchen plumbing costs. On an average remodel, plumbing materials will match lighting expenses at about $800. If you’re considering that layout change then plumbing and gas lines may have to move. That will lead to the added costs in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting and inspections.</p>
<h3><b>Kitchen remodel labor and installation costs</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Preparing the renovation site—leveling tilted floors, replacing the sheetrock, etc.—can cost a few thousand dollars. Add to that installation of appliances and cabinetry, plumbing and electrical, which could take about 17 percent of your total budget or almost $3,500 on an average kitchen renovation. It’s worth pointing out that labor costs can change based on geography. New York City is the most expensive. Chicago’s labor costs are on average about 18 percent cheaper, according to RSMeans data. Philadelphia is a few percentage points lower at about 21 percent and LA sits at more than 30 percent lower than New York. And check with your contractor if their fees cover permits. If not, that could add another $1,000 or two.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Resale Value</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Setting a budget can be overwhelming with the cost of all these separate items. The good news is renovations are an investment. For example, a $62,000 investment in a kitchen <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could see</a> a $40,000 increase in resale value on the home, according to Remodeling Magazine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, that also increases the value of your property for taxation purposes. In Philadelphia, home improvements can get a <a href="https://www.biaofphiladelphia.com/tax-abatement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax abatement</a>. The value your new kitchen adds to your home will not be taxed for 10 years, said Marianne Scott from the Building Industry Association of Philadelphia. Similar programs exist in many other cities such as Pittsburgh and <a href="https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/community-development/housing-assistance/residential-property-tax-abatement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cincinnati</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, no two renovations and their budgets are the same. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator allocated their $25,000 kitchen renovation budget:</p>
