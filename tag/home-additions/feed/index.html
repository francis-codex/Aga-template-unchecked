<h3></h3>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">A country vibe in the Westchester County suburbs</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">“This unbelievable property felt like it was in the country, rather than the suburbs,” Shana Sandberg of <a href="https://www.revelcraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revel Craft and Design</a> said. The 1953 estate, comprising of 1.3 acres in Westchester County&#8217;s Harrison, NY, had a pastoral feel. When the current owners purchased the derelict foreclosure, the house was 5,900 square feet of interior space with seven bedrooms. But the home’s interior had no large meeting space—not a great room nor a dining hall. The existing hang-out spots were a small living room, a cramped kitchen, and a basement den.</span></p>

<p><span class="s9">The house’s owners, part of a large extended family that had long enjoyed summers together, had grown out of their previous five-bedroom home. Wanting to turn this new, bigger house into their happy place, they hired the Revel team. Shana’s firm found the property and helped guide the family through its purchase. The next challenge was to create and carry out their transformational Westchester County home remodel.</span></p>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">Gathering spots for the family</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">At the top of the To-Do list was to make a place, or places, for the </span><span class="s10">family to gather.</span><span class="s9"> Shana posted the renovation on Sweeten and assisted the homeowners in hiring a contractor who would help bring her vision for the home and property to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="s9">Inside the house, Shana recalled, the existing dining room couldn’t accommodate her clients’ dining table. The kitchen was so poorly designed, it cut off the first floor’s flow. Finishes throughout the home were dated or in bad shape. The property’s outside spaces also had issues. “The outdoor space felt cut off from the land around it,” Shana said. She set out to transform this old home into the ultimate multi-generation compound. The house would have its very first whole-family gathering room along with an inviting chain of indoor and outdoor places and spaces.</span><b></b></p>

<h3><span style="color: #000000;">An addition with an outside view</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="s9">The property’s overhaul was truly a vision in motion. The new house was a dream with its seven sleeping rooms, each of which needed only light renovation, but its kitchen and bathrooms needed total redos. Creating common rooms would require additional square footage. “It was clear where a new family room would go,” Shana said, and how a 750-square-foot addition could make the house function better. She also wanted to enhance the owners’ connection with the property and natural surroundings. “It was easy to see,” Shana added, “decks and pools as the new gathering spaces.”</span><b></b></span></p>
<p><span class="s9" style="color: #000000;">The vision for all areas was to engage with the outdoors. “The addition was planned so it did not disturb a huge, gorgeous oak tree,” Shana explained; the family room extension pushes into the backyard, and windows on three sides provide 180-degree views. The plan also <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added a screened-in porch and a deck</a>.</span></p>

<h3><span class="s9">A facelift for the house’s interior</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">Inside the house, the remodel changes were just as transformational. Terracotta tile floors were replaced with smooth, warm white-oak flooring. Carrara-looking porcelain tile was chosen to bring a timeless feel to the family’s bathrooms. “For the main-floor powder bathroom,” Shana said, “we’ve had some fun with a surprise moment of a wallcovering called Sumatra.”</span><b></b></p>

<p><span class="s9">Throughout the home, Shana put an emphasis on functionality and took every opportunity to incorporate storage. “We actually made the kitchen and an adjacent bathroom smaller,” she said, revising the layouts and carving out hidden storage, including a pantry, hall closet, and much-needed laundry room cabinetry. “In the new family room, we integrated a built-in bench to hide toys and blankets.”</span></p>

<p><span class="s9">Shana had eyes on everything down to the little details, playing many roles over the course of this renovation. “We were excited to wear most of the hats in this project, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from planning to architecture, to interiors</a> and landscape,” she said. The renovation touched more than 8,000 square feet. The final square footage totaled 8,176 square feet of interior space and 3,000 exterior square feet. Working with their Sweeten contractor, Revel completed it in a year.</span></p>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">Making the most of a rocky situation</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">For the main exterior space, the goal of communing with nature was similar. “We designed cascading decks,” Shana explained, describing &#8220;hoppable&#8221; platforms that are large, inviting steps into the landscape. Minimal steel cable railings guided walkers downward.</span></p>

<p><span class="s9">The project was complicated, and the team geared up for unexpected issues. “We hit a doozy when we found that the property is mostly built on ledge or rock. The grade was too high, causing termite issues and more,” Shana said. Much of the property required regrading and excavation for the pool involved weeks of chipping. “We were prepared for it budget-wise, but it delayed us,” she said.</span></p>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">An outdoor family playground finally emerges</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">Shana extended a stone retaining wall by nearly 40 feet in making a surround for the new pool, and created a planting bed between the pool and the wall. “Now, from the decks as well as the family room, you look onto a wildflower garden that surprises with new blooms throughout spring, summer, and fall,” she explained. Instead of putting a traditional fence around the pool, the Revel team designed a bucolic log enclosure including almost transparent safety mesh. </span></p>

<h3><span class="s9">Teamwork in action</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">From beginning to end, Shana “drove the concept of creating this feeling of being out in the country</span><span class="s9">, with a palette and layout for both the interior and exteriors.” The Sweeten contractor, she said, was paramount to the project’s success. “The contractors truly felt like our partners,” she said, citing strong daily communication and accounting transparency. “They put us first.”</span></p>
<p><span class="s9">Sweeten supported the process. “They checked in during the project to make sure we were getting what we needed from our contractors, and on how the project was coming along,” Shana said.</span></p>

<p><span class="s9">The end result? An easy-access forever family home that feels far from the fray. And construction challenges that have completely faded into the woodwork thanks to good partner in her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a>. “Renovation combined with new construction is a game of planning, patience, and pivoting,” Shana says. “So much can and will go wrong. Knowing how to pivot can turn a bad circumstance into a great solution.” This family haven is living, breathing proof of it.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>In Houston, home additions are a great way to increase the square footage of a house</h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3479-scaled.jpg" alt="exterior of a Houston house addition" width="2560" height="1920" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50209" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3479-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3479-scaled-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3479-scaled-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1">Are you living in a home of good size, but need more space? Whether it’s creating another bedroom or increasing the living area, adding onto your property can seem like a complex undertaking. Houston home additions require careful planning and due diligence. With the right general contractor in Houston to manage the approvals and remodeling process, you can realize the potential of expanding your existing home. Your contractor should also be up-to-date with the local codes and regulations. Here, Sweeten provides some guidance on points to consider.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3">Make a plan with contractors and architects</h3>
<p class="p1">Unlike smaller remodeling projects, building an addition is a complex, multi-layered project. It requires a team of qualified professionals who can help you.</p>
<p class="p1">A home addition is the total of a vast number of sub-projects. These projects range from design and planning to drywall work, flooring, painting, and more. Plus, these projects extend over weeks or months. There is one person who ties all of these strings together and makes it work: the general contractor.</p>
<p class="p1">Begin planning your project by hiring a licensed <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/houston-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor in Houston</a>. The spring and summer are good times to start since it gives you a headstart in the queue for renovations the following year.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Building Houston home additions: Outward or upward?</h3>
<p class="p1">Homeowners in Houston planning for home additions may raise a frequent question: Should you build outward or upward? It’s a difficult question for any area, as both have their advantages and disadvantages:</p>
<h4 class="p5">Building a ground-level addition outward</h4>
<p class="p1">Building outward means creating an addition that is at ground level. The addition is built adjacent to the existing house. At the end of the project, the wall between the two structures is opened up. Building a ground-level addition is less complex than adding to the top of a house. Plus, it is less invasive. Homeowners typically can live in the home while the addition is built.</p>
<p class="p1">Houston is largely a flat, one-story house city. Generally, the area has more single-story homes than double-story homes. Older, historic neighborhoods in Houston such as The Heights, Bellaire, or West U have generously-sized lots. In an era of shrinking lots, properties like this are rare opportunities for building outward.</p>
<p class="p1">Another upside: one-story homes are easier to cool down. Since heat rises, it collects in the second story. As a result, two-story homes are more expensive to cool.</p>
<h4 class="p5">Building a second-story addition upward</h4>
<p class="p1">Building upward means adding a second story to the home. This type of renovation removes the roof and adds extra structural support. Then, the second story is built. With this highly invasive project, residents usually have to vacate the home for an extended period.</p>
<p class="p1">If your Houston property lot is not spacious, you may want to consider building upward. This preserves your yard for pets or children or for gardening.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Permits and approvals</h3>
<p class="p1">Permitted approvals by the City of Houston are required before and after building your addition. Building plans and fees must be submitted to the city before the building begins. Numerous corrections may be required. If approved, a building permit is issued.</p>
<p class="p1">However, this is not your final approval. In essence, a permit is just that: It permits you to build. Once the work is finished, the addition is inspected. If approved, a final approval is then issued.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s best to leave permits and approvals for large projects like home additions in the hands of contractors. These professionals know how to walk your project through the permitting process to minimize delays.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Houston home additions require a plan for extreme heat</h3>
<p>Heat and sun are part of living in the Gulf Coast region. Be sure to consider those inevitable high temperatures.</p>
<p>In the summer, the sun rises in the northeast and sets in the northwest. Planning your addition with heat in mind can be as simple as orientation. If possible, orient the addition so that it does not face in the direction of the sun.</p>
<p>Other passive cooling methods include planting large shade trees as part of the landscaping plan. Speak with your contractor about cool roof materials coated in glass fiber and aluminum.</p>
<p>Your current air conditioning unit might be able to handle the increased loads of the new addition. More often, it’s a good idea to install a separate A/C unit for the addition. Mini-split air-conditioning that doesn’t require ductwork is also popular.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your home addition or home remodel, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post your project</a> on Sweeten. You will be connected to a vetted list of general contractors in Houston to schedule site visits. You&#8217;ll be on your way to a renovating journey and a new home.</span></p>

<h3>Deciding to renovate for a forever home</h3>
<p>David and I<span class="s1"> bought our home, a traditional English <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-family home</a> built in 1924, over 12 years ago. Over the years with our family growing, (our children, Nehemiah and Gertrude, and our dog, Boston), we knew we needed more space. We&#8217;ve been making updates room by room but realized we needed a home that would work for us long-term. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46957" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-08.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Our location in Mid-City, close to Los Angeles’ Miracle Mile, is great. I am in advertising and David is in logistics—our jobs are both in L.A. We didn’t want to sell our house. We wanted to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maximize it and create space</a> so that we weren&#8217;t living on top of one another. Additionally, we wanted to modernize and open up the interior with smart home features. The minimalist aesthetic would complement the exterior architecture and allow us to be rid of the dated stucco.</p>
<div></div>
<h3>A unique home renovation team</h3>
<p>We’d posted our full home remodel on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, and found <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three Los Angeles contractors</a> to bid. Sweeten offered us assistance in evaluating all of the GCs’ bids, and we chose our contractor.</p>
<p>Thanks to our construction team, we managed an entire remodel of our home in seven months. Interestingly, our team was a very diverse, all-female group of professionals which I loved: <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our woman-owned general contractor in Los Angeles</a> was Filipino, the project manager was Japanese, and our architect, Susan Nwanpka Gillespie of Nwanpka Design was African-American. My husband is South African, and I&#8217;m Scottish, which completed the international connection.</p>

The kitchen has a feeling of openness and relaxation, and we love the flowing wood element on the pitched ceiling.

<h3>A new interior and home addition in Los Angeles</h3>
<p>In the beginning, it was easy to be overwhelmed by how big the project was. Our questions were mostly on the structural side—what could we do with an older home? Could we accomplish our vision? We wanted a Scandinavian-modern look that was contemporary with Mid-Century and industrial touches. When the architect, structural engineer, and general contractor all told us that it could be done, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found the confidence</a> to greenlight the project.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-07.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48333" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-07.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-07-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48332" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48336" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>The plan was to add square footage to the front and the back of the house. The family room, primary bedroom, and primary bath would all be enlarged. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened up the ceiling</a> in the open-concept kitchen which made the space seem much larger.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-02.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48328" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-02.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-02-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-03.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="1199" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48329" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-03.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>We would go all the way down to the house’s framing and exterior details. David and I chose 10-foot glass bi-fold doors to line the back and front of the house for indoor/outdoor living. We wanted unique windows and an incredible skylight in the kitchen. The specially-fitted wood interior doors are extra tall. Finally, the project was taking shape.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-04.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48330" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-04.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-04-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></div>
<h3>A wood aesthetic throughout</h3>
<p>An <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-plan kitchen</a> featured prominently in our design. The custom 10-foot island, which has a three-inch honed-quartz countertop, is the centerpiece. We used matte gunmetal gray custom cabinets for the lower storage and natural wood for the upper cabinets and parts of the island. Inside the cupboards, we designed hidden cutlery and storage drawers, as well as vertical drawers, for clever European functionality. The kitchen has a feeling of openness and relaxation, and we love the flowing wood element on the pitched ceiling. For the floors, we went with hardwood in an oil finish and extended that choice throughout the home.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-12.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48338" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-12.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-12-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-11.jpg" alt="los angeles bathroom" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone wp-image-48337" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-11.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-11-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Another focus was on the bathrooms. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded the primary bath</a> and added a powder room. I love the statement wall and the tile and the brushed-nickel faucets. We used matte white quartz on the vanity and chose a simple floating toilet. The powder room received a compact sink and vanity for the small space. I wanted all eyes to be on the geometric wallpaper in the powder room. How could they not be?</p>
<p>We were so happy with the custom cabinetry in the kitchen and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baths</a> that we utilized it all around our home, creating hidden storage in the family room and a vanity in the bedroom. We also installed custom rolling blinds on every window.</p>

<h3>Our woman-owned general contractor in Los Angeles came through</h3>
<p>Our renovation team <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">understood our vision</a>. They were organized, took detailed meeting notes so nothing slipped through the cracks, and kept the project on schedule. They also knew their stuff! The contractor confirmed that the fabrication and installation techniques of every worker were in line with the aesthetics of the übermodern home we wanted. This proved a critical element in our home’s finished look.</p>

<h3>Choosing between a house or apartment</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My husband and I used to live in Manhattan in a one-bedroom apartment. Once we decided to have children, we knew we wanted to live closer to our families. So we opted to buy a house in the Bronx and have our parents partake in child-raising. Originally we thought we would have one child, live in the area for a few years, and then move back to Manhattan once school started. </span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="s1">We were most excited about having a bathroom on the first floor and not having to go upstairs.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Our house addition plan: Envisioning more space</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, we soon fell in love with having a house and wanted to have more kids. Our neighborhood is quite ethnically and socioeconomically diverse. It feels like a nice mix, like we’re away from the city, but not quite in the suburbs. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We wanted more living space on the first floor because it’s where we spend most of our time as a family. We also wanted our children, who are 9, 6, and 3, to have larger bedrooms and decided to add a 250-square-foot attic dormer for that purpose. The idea was for the new space to be airy and maximize the view of beautiful trees in our backyard. Our 280-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement converted</a> into a ping pong room for extra recreational space.</span></p>

<h3>Transformation outside the kitchen</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, the window that previously looked out on the old deck was converted to a passthrough window that now connects to the new sunroom. The kitchen countertop was extended about two feet to the end of the wall that divides the dining area and kitchen. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Off of the kitchen, we added a 280-square-foot sunroom that includes a bathroom, pantry room, and living area. We were most excited about having a bathroom on the first floor and not having to go upstairs. The pantry provides tons of food, toy, and sports equipment storage. The new <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor deck</a> is off of the sunroom and is 250 square feet.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our favorite part of the renovation was working with the architect and our Sweeten general contractor on the layout of the new rooms.</span> <span class="s1">However, the most anxiety-provoking situation was waiting for support beams to be delivered and installed. For two days we had no roof and obsessed about checking the weather to make sure it didn’t rain! </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor had experience with all aspects of our project. He was great at giving us ideas and then executing the plan. We also shared the same taste in simple, modern, open design. He was able to deliver exactly what we envisioned. And if you need to file for city permits, our advice is to use an architect who can do that. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was great to have Sweeten follow up every step of the way. We knew Sweeten would be there if we experienced problems with our contractor. Luckily, we didn’t need that assistance. Our contractor’s team was excellent!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our new house addition space makes us feel less crowded. Now, our children can grow and play without feeling like we’re being swallowed up by all of their toys.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43145 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LA-ExteriorHome-2.jpg" alt="Second floor addition renovation" width="1000" height="692" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LA-ExteriorHome-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LA-ExteriorHome-2-300x208.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LA-ExteriorHome-2-600x415.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding a second story to your L.A. home can solve the problem of limited square footage. Knowing <span>how to add a home addition in Los Angeles </span>means growing families have an option of not moving into a different, bigger home. And it doesn’t impinge on your yard space! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s no doubt that adding another story is a big undertaking, both financially and in terms of its timeline. It’s also likely that the renovation will force you to relocate (at least for part of the project.) But to balance that out, it can add a lot of value to your home. Also, many homeowners find it worthwhile to consider a long-wanted first-floor renovation as well. </span><span class="s1">Here, we outline the ins and outs of adding a second-story addition to your home.</span></p>
<p><em>(Photo above) Second-story build in Los Angeles by Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5891#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor Cecille </a></em></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How long do second-story additions take?</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A typical second story that includes a least a bedroom and a bathroom takes at least three to five months, according to Los Angeles-based <span class="s2">Sweeten </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5830#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">contractor Tami</span></a>. Many elements can increase that time including which county your property is located in, if it is a hillside lot, how much the first floor walls need fortifying as well as how big you want it and other design features. If the addition is extensive and complicated, a 12-month timeline is much more feasible, according to <span class="s2">Sweeten </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5852#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">L.A. contractor Shannon</span></a>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Since some of your roof will be removed, you should start this type of project in early Spring, said Tami. This is so you can ideally have the project completed by the winter, which is the rainy season for L.A. Forest fires fueled by the Santa Ana winds—which blow October through April—can also hinder a renovation project in affected areas.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much does it cost to add a second-story addition?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Expect to pay at least $100,000 for a second-story addition, Tami said. Contractor Shannon put the starting cost to add a second story at around $200 a square foot. Some <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors in L.A. have completed second-story additions for as low as $300 a square foot, and up to $700 a square foot. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are two key factors that will determine your costs to add a second story:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>If it&#8217;s structurally driven</strong>: In L.A., <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating on a hillside lot</a> will take more time and cost more money. This is especially the case for second-story additions, Shannon said. The project will require a soil engineer and a soil report to determine if any additional foundation work needs to be completed to support the addition.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The walls of any home, regardless of whether it sits on a flat lot or on a hillside, will also need to be assessed and most likely reinforced to support the additional story. Your first-floor ceiling which must now do double duty as your second story’s floor also needs added help. “This usually requires supporting beams and posts,” said Tami.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>If it&#8217;s client-driven</strong>: This means your tastes and what you want or need will have a big impact on your budget, according to Tami. Do you want <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bathroom</a> or even <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a kitchenette</a>? Multiple bedrooms? How expensive will your finishes be? The good news is that, unlike structural elements, the client-driven aspect of your budget is all within your control.<br /></span></li>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Do second-story additions increase your home’s value?</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Slapping on a second story isn’t all money out. It does add value, and in some cases, a <em>lot</em> of value. To calculate how much you can recoup when you eventually sell your home, figure out what your second-story renovation will cost per square foot. Then, compare it to the square-foot price of homes in your area that match the size and amenities of your home once the planned renovation is completed.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Another factor to consider is the cost of moving. For many growing families, a second-story addition is a remedy to finding a bigger house elsewhere. Selling a home isn’t free. Nor is moving. When you sell a home, it generally costs at least six percent of its value. Then, add to that several thousand dollars if you enlist a moving company.  For the family mentioned above, the cost to move would have been at least $50,000<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is the impact on your first floor?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It’s very rare that the first floor of a home will have the muscle to support a second-story addition without help. “</span><span class="s1">In my experience, doing a second story involves the first story,” said <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles contractor</a> Shannon. “You can’t just pop on a second story.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As stated earlier, the walls and ceilings of your original home will need added beams and poles to hold the extra weight. Your foundations will be examined too, especially if your lot is on a hillside. As you can tell, your first floor will be thoroughly disturbed. Because of this, many homeowners opt to renovate part of their original home by <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding kitchens</a>, giving a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom a facelift</a>, or adding new rooms. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One necessity that homeowners often forget about is where to put the staircase, according to Shannon. Unless you’re intending to use a ladder, be prepared for the staircase to eat into some of that first-floor living space. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting permits for a second-story addition renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The majority of second-story additions involve an additional bedroom and bathroom. That means, on top of a general building permit, your project will require electrical, plumbing, and mechanical (if you have an HVAC system). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The length of time for permits to be approved will vary from area to area. For example, the permits required for a second-story addition can take about 12 weeks for the City of Los Angeles. Paying an expeditor can always reduce wait times. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As with all other remodeling projects in the State of California, your second-story addition must be Title 24 compliant. Title 24 puts an energy consumption limit on your home and impacts factors like what light bulbs you use, to the efficiency of your air conditioning. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Negotiating zoning rules for second-story additions </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For most second-story additions, zoning is not an issue, but there are some cases where it can impact your plans. Here are a few rules to look out for:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">In recent years, some L.A. counties have gone to war against mansionization, where new builds create massive, box-like houses. These ruin the look and feel of areas historically filled with quainter structures. For example, the Los Angeles City Council reduced the floor area of new homes or proposed remodels to 45 percent of the lot size, Curbed <a href="https://la.curbed.com/2017/3/1/14783162/los-angeles-mansionization-rules-mcmansions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">reported</span></a> in 2017.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">If your home is in a historic preservation overlay zone (HPOZ), then any proposed changes to the outside of your building will be scrutinized. Any changes will either not be allowed to move forward or permit approvals could take a long time. A neighborhood association can also hold sway over your second-story dreams.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Other factors you need to consider are height restrictions and whether you will block your neighbor&#8217;s view. This is often the case with hillside lots, said Sweeten contractor Shannon. One of her Malibu clients wanted to add a second story to a home that already had high ceilings. However, due to <a href="https://qcode.us/codes/malibu-coastal/view.php?topic=local_implementation_plan-6-6_5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">height restrictions</span></a>—24 feet for flat-roofed homes and 28 for pitched roofs—the client couldn’t fit the second story in.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Powerline clearance is also something to watch. Typically a residential structure needs to be at least <span class="s2">15 feet below</span> any overhead powerlines. This might not be an issue if you’re adding a second story to your home, which is unlikely to be under powerlines. However, when it comes to another floor for your garage, this is something to watch out for.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re dreaming of a bigger home, but you love the house you live in, consider second-story additions. The first step is to find a licensed general contractor who is up-to-date on local codes and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has worked on projects</a> with similar environmental considerations. </span><span class="s1">When you’re ready to renovate, work with us to <span class="s2">find the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best contractors in Los Angeles</a></span>.</span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064148729"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How much does a second story addition cost in California?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">In California, on average, a second-story addition will cost at least $100,000. Depending on the complexity of the work needed and the space being added, homeowners can expect to pay anywhere between $300-$700 per square foot for a second-story addition.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064163691"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Can you add a second story to a house?</strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">It is possible to add a second story to a house, but it will depend on your property and the existing home’s condition. For example, adding a second story to a home on a hillside lot will take more time and cost more money than adding one to a non-hillside home. This is because the project will require a soil engineer and a soil report to determine if any additional foundation work needs to be completed to support the addition.</p>
