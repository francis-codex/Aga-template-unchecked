										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Clinton Hill home gains flexible space with sliding doors</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33864 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, open shelving, bar" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two decades ago, native New Yorkers Margery and Jim Fields worked in Manhattan and lived just outside the city. In 1996, the family relocated to Philadelphia when Jim was transferred for a job. The couple always had a special place in their hearts for New York, and when their kids grew up, they decided it was the right time to return.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33866 size-chrono" title="Margery and Jim" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-16-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NYC-Skyline.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34597 size-chrono" title="view" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NYC-Skyline-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34566 size-chrono" title="floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Floorplan-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they began their search for an NYC home, they wanted something a bit unique. They looked at many listings, but it was the view from their apartment at the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a> (a Brooklyn complex near and dear to us here at Sweeten, after renovating so many homes there!) that sold them on the one-bedroom place they ended up purchasing. They loved the sweeping view of Manhattan—the island that drew them back to the five boroughs.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33868 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-04-723x933.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33875 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-07-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33867 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, subway tile, spot lighting, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment itself was a different story. It hadn’t been updated in 40 years and had been chopped up with too many walls. Despite this, they decided that the incredible views were worth the trade-off of having to renovate. After a remodeling of their Philadelphia kitchen several years ago, they had a good idea of a wishlist for their next project. They wisely decided to live in the space for six months before starting the design process to get a feel for how they would use it—and to understand the light&#8217;s effect in the apartment at various times of the day. They heard about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, from their neighbors, and it kept coming up in conversation. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose this Sweeten contractor</a>, who had previously done several projects in the Clinton Hill Co-ops.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34564 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-05-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33869 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-05a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34108 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-05a-723x484.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, subway tile, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="484" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once discussions got underway, they made some decisions with the help of their Sweeten contractor; prior work in the building meant he knew what was behind the walls and what to anticipate, so was able to guide Margery and Jim on what actions would need to come next in the process. He knew the bathroom ceiling was a drop ceiling and would be able to install the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotlighting</a> they wanted. Their contractor was also familiar with the building&#8217;s wiring and informed them it would not support an induction cooktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple’s design vision was an industrial-yet-modern aesthetic. They wanted to take down the walls boxing in the kitchen and allow as much light into the space as possible. The full scope included a new kitchen and bath as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33873 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-04-723x933.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33872 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, hardwood floors, sliding door, french door, open shelving, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, Margery and Jim planned to convert the dining nook beside the kitchen into a second bedroom but ultimately decided on a flex-space solution made possible by sliding doors. When they didn’t need the second bedroom, the doors could remain open to take full advantage of the two large windows in the nook. The contractor created a custom solution by fusing two estate-sale-find French doors that Margery and Jim had found to make a sliding pocket door. The renovated nook is now a seating area that can be closed off from the living room to create a guest sleeping area that feels like a “studio within the apartment,” explained Margery. It is also a cozy spot for guests to perch when the pair entertain and are preparing food in the kitchen. (Given that Jim has seven brothers who are all married, they definitely need the seating for guests!)</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-03.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33876 mb-0 size-chrono" title="long-blue-kitchen-cabinet-peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-03.gif" alt="long blue kitchen cabinet with knob and white kitchen peninsula with cabinets after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the kitchen revamp, Jim and Margery decided on dark gray cabinets paired with a light quartz countertop and glass subway tile. The contractor suggested a full-length <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pantry</a> next to the refrigerator on the wall separating the kitchen from the living room, providing unexpected bonus storage. On the other side of the fridge, open shelving is built onto a mirrored backsplash for maximum light reflection into the kitchen. Corner shelving was added, with a Lazy Susan to maximize under-counter space leaving enough room for a full-size dishwasher.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33877 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, hardwood floors, subway tile, stainless steel appliances, sliding door, spot lighting" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-14.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33878 mb-0 size-chrono" title="gray-blue-kitchen-cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-14.gif" alt="gray blue kitchen cabinet with oven and a white door after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple intended to add a kitchen island at first. But when they saw how open the space felt without it, they chose to leave it as is. Similarly, the original design called for stainless steel shelving to be added to the back wall above the sink but decided to leave it open for an airier feel overhead.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33882 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-06-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33881 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33879 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, bathroom, large-format tiles, vinyl tub, bronze penny floor tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Margery and Jim were able to make use of another estate sale find—the black large-format tiles, which cost a dollar a piece. They paired those tiles with an unusual bronze <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penny tile</a> Margery had once seen and admired in a restaurant. A cast-iron tub was swapped out for a vinyl one that allowed the contractor to bring the wall tile around the front to tie the space together. Modern Brizo fixtures helped to finish the clean, streamlined look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that their project is complete, Margery and Jim have a few words of wisdom for would-be renovators. They stress the importance of selecting the right contractor—one with whom you can have a good “communication cadence,” said Margery. “We would text or talk to our contractor multiple times a week, or multiple times a day as things came up. That ability to instantly communicate would keep things from being delayed or misinterpreted.” They love the openness of the new layout, &#8220;while keeping some separation between the kitchen and main living space,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;We&#8217;re glad we didn&#8217;t take out the bar/pantry wall.&#8221; Check out their Behind-The-Reno video below:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How to maximize space at home: use transom windows, pocket doors, custom walls and more</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Open floor plans are all the rage—so much so that the first temptation of a renovating homeowner may be to tear down walls. But before you bring in the wrecking ball, consider if you&#8217;ll have enough personal space for your family (or frequent overnight guests), and how a strategically placed wall or partition can maximize your space at home while defining the private areas of your home. Take cues from these Sweeten homeowners and their clever uses of space, from carving out niches and capturing square footage in other areas to adding moveable partitions for smooth transitions.</span></p>

<h3>Transom windows allow for a guest bedroom to be added</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an L-shaped living room in their new apartment, Deeksha and Joe saw the opportunity to create a guest bedroom. All they needed to do was add a wall and a doorway. The only problem was that the placement of the wall would block the light and hide a gorgeous view from the corner windows. A unique solution—an interior wall of windows—provides the necessary privacy for the guest bedroom while still allowing the flow of light to reach the rest of the living room. The new space also serves as a light-filled workspace for the family.</p>

<h3>Custom sliding doors to help maximize a 500 square-foot home</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Claire and Dan purchased their 500-square-foot studio apartment, they knew it needed a renovation. The unit hadn’t been updated since the &#8217;60s, and the couple wanted to build out a junior one-bedroom by separating the living/kitchen area from the sleeping space. With DOB regulations preventing permanent wall additions, they worked with their architect and Sweeten general contractor to install custom sliding doors. With the sliding doors, they maximize their space at home by keeping the space open during the day, and closing them for privacy or while entertaining. </span></p>

<h3>Strategically removing a hallway adds space (and light!)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long hallway was the main culprit of wasted space in Walter and Laura’s Park Slope apartment. By removing their entry hallway, they imbued their apartment with more natural light</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and space. With the newly-provided footage, their kitchen swapped places with a spare bedroom and got an expanded, angular footprint in the foyer. A small dining/entertaining area was also added to the kitchen, allowing guests to visit with the couple while they cooked. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Adding a wall creates a new bedroom, while transom windows let in soft light</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The notion of adding a dishwasher to their kitchen escalated into a full gut renovation, and then took another, unexpected turn when Chris and Amber found out their second child was on the way. The project was now an opportunity to carve out a room for their older son. A wall was added to separate the dining nook from the rest of the kitchen, turning it into a bedroom, and a milk glass transom window was installed above the doorway to allow light to filter through. Finishing touches; a crib, picture shelves, roller blinds, and a colorful rug complete the transformation from dining nook to a growing boy&#8217;s bedroom.</p>

<h3><strong>A studio morphs into a one-bedroom with the help of a full dividing wall</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New homeowner Paul landed his perfect apartment by getting creative in his search: instead of buying a “true” one-bedroom apartment in Hell’s Kitchen, he purchased a studio that was listed as a junior one bedroom. Paul noticed the apartment’s previous owner was already mimicking a one-bedroom layout by using a built-in bookcase to separate the bedroom and living area. He replicated this layout in his renovation by having this general contractor add a full dividing wall (with a pocket door) to separate his living area from his bedroom. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Turning a studio into a two-bedroom (yes, really!) with movable partitions </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal planned on making their studio function as a two-bedroom; not an easy feat, considering the apartment’s existing open-plan layout. They added a custom king-size platform bed in the space designated as the master bedroom. The key feature, movable partitions, allow it to work as a space for sleep or as another part of the home. For the &#8220;second bedroom,&#8221; a queen-size Murphy bed that folds up horizontally to save space and a closet were installed in the area designated as the living room, which uses the same sliding doors for privacy. As an added bonus, the wall unit that houses the pull-out bed and closet blends into the surrounding walls when the bed is tucked away.</p>

<h3><strong>Major wall movement reshapes an entire 700 square-foot apartment layout</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn one bedroom into two, create a walk-in closet, and make a dining space fit for hosting: these items topped the to-do list for sisters (and roommates) Deanna and Daria’s renovation in New York’s Sutton Place. To really maximize space at their home, construction moved walls from the existing dining room, living room and bedroom to reshape the new rooms: nearly the entire space of the apartment. Now, their 700 square-foot apartment maximizes every inch of space while showcasing the sisters’ preference for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bold patterns and color. </span></p>

<h3><strong>To maximize space at home for a new baby, walls &amp; a doorway create a nursery </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to make their one-bedroom apartment family-ready, Karen and Kevin set their sights on converting a dining nook situated at the tail end of the kitchen into a nursery for their daughter. They added a new wall and doorway, which allows  for entry from the main living area. The new nursery, now completely separate from the kitchen, receives a flood of sunlight during the day, an added benefit from the window it inherited from the former dining area.</p>

<h3><strong>A retractable partition create privacy for parents and children in a one-bedroom</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A one-bedroom in a coveted neighborhood inspired Casey and Kumar to maximize space at home for their four-person family. After examining their family’s daily routines, the couple decided to give their sons the master bedroom so that they would have a space for playtime and bedtime. They added a multipurpose space in the living area with a wall of custom millwork and a pull-out bed. This became the space that Casey and Kumar could sleep and store their clothes. To preserve privacy and block light and noise, a retractable partition now divides the designated sleeping space from the rest of the home. The addition of the partition now offers flexibility for the family&#8217;s daily needs.</p>

<h3><strong>Need your one-bedroom to be a two-bedroom? Demo a closet, build a partition, add a door. Voila!</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way, Lindsay and Matt needed to turn their one-bedroom into a two-bedroom apartment. They planned to do this by splitting the existing bedroom into a master bedroom and nursery. A few key layout changes made this all possible: demolishing closets to gain back valuable square footage, building a partition, and creating a doorway that opened into the living room. These newly constructed spaces have allowed the home to reach its full potential by making room for the whole family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When they began looking for more space, Chelsea residents Lauren and Ross didn’t want to move far from their Manhattan neighborhood. Luckily, they found a new home in Kensington House, an Art Deco co-op building just three blocks from their old place. The two-bed, two-bath apartment featured plentiful space for entertaining—a must for Lauren, a food industry professional, as well as the perfect nook for Ross’ piano. The baths in this Emory Roth-designed building were true to their 1930s roots, with out-of-style tiling, industrial flushometer toilets, and exposed radiator pipes that were an unattractive hazard.

<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband, Ross, and I purchased a two-bedroom apartment in Chelsea last year. We were already living in a one-bedroom apartment in the same neighborhood and wanted to upgrade to an apartment that had more space. After about three months of looking, we found the perfect apartment, only three blocks from where we were living.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the loft-style layout of the apartment we found, but the bathrooms were in a bit of a sorry state. The tile was outdated and one of the baths had a huge old-school metal tub stopper located next to the toilet. So we planned on gutting the two spaces along with a few extra upgrades, such as replacing the kitchen’s backsplash and lighting, sanding the floors, repainting the apartment, removing a desk in the study to accommodate a piano, and turning a less-than-ideal barn door in the dining foyer into a more discreet pocket door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We hired <a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Arrow</a>, a friend’s sister’s design company to assist us with the design process, and they, in turn, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our contractor</a>. Our Sweeten contractor was also very helpful throughout the design process and suggested modifications and tweaks to the original design that best fit our needs.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">Creating a wide barn pocket door proved to be a challenge but &#8220;our contractor suggested we attach three store-bought doors together&#8230;&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We initially budgeted two to three months for the renovation process, and typical for New York, ended up taking about four months. The apartment’s previous tenants took all of their light fixtures with them when they moved out, so we purchased new light fixtures for all of the rooms. I created a Pinterest board to help refine my ideas. We especially love the distinctive CB2 chandelier which hangs above our dining room table.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being a food writer and having written <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Kitchens-Behind-Burner-Hanoi/dp/B00AK2TMOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four Kitchens</a></em>, a book about working in restaurants around the world, it was important for me to have a clean, streamlined kitchen for cooking and entertaining. We loved the custom cabinets that were already in place but wanted to update the backsplash by installing white subway tiles to replace the existing small red-and-brown multicolored ones. We also swapped out the sink faucet for a contemporary Grohe fixture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ross loves playing piano, and with this apartment, we were finally able to accommodate a piano in our space. We removed a wooden plank which the previous owners had used as a desk and created a nook which was a perfect spot for an upright piano.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Creating the pocket door separating the dining area from the bedroom proved a bit of a challenge at first, but our contractor helpfully suggested that we attach three store-bought doors together, and then build a fake wall over what used to be the space for the barn door. This would be a more affordable solution than purchasing a custom wood door, which he noted would be very expensive. We then painted the door and surrounding walls Hamilton Blue by Benjamin Moore, a color we had in our old apartment, and one that we knew looked good as a backdrop for our artwork. Also in the dining area, we covered a pipe that had previously been exposed. We had initially wanted to get rid of it since it was in the middle of the walkway, but this was not possible. Our unit was originally two apartments that had been combined at some point in the past, and the pipe had been inside the dividing walls.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathrooms probably required the most work. Our designers initially suggested moving around the placement of the sink and toilet to maximize space, but this was going to require additional permits and more time. As such, we ended up leaving the tubs, sinks, and toilets in the same places, and just upgraded with new fixtures. I love taking baths so we got deep-soaking tubs for both bathrooms, as well as <a href="https://www.totousa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toto toilets</a>. For the master bath, I was inspired by the clean, elegant look of hotel bathrooms and wanted marble walls to be a focus of that space. We opted for a glass panel on the tub, which our contractor sourced for us. We also covered unattractive heating pipes with grates from <a href="https://www.archgrille.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Grille</a>. Custom shelving was added in the form of a shower niche, as well as a large in-wall cabinet opposite the sink.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the guest bath, a simple white tile with black grout was chosen to complement the Coyuchi shower curtain and an Of a Kind planter we had brought from our previous bathroom. We ran into some issues with the tiles purchased by our designers for the guest bath, so our contractor made suggestions that helped the material work in the space. Contemporary <a href="https://www.graff-designs.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graff shower fixtures</a> were selected for both showers. As for the color palette, we chose white because it was a neutral color, and it is just very soothing to have a white bathroom. Both looks are timeless, and we figured they would be appealing to us now and hopefully to anyone who bought the apartment later on.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the four months of work, we were able to move into our new space, which we now love. We tried to create a contemporary space that reflects our personal tastes while adding elements which also capture the Art Deco heritage of our apartment building.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>:</strong> Credit a steady diet of renovation TV shows with inspiring this 22nd-floor bathroom makeover. Owner Charlie Wintczak occupied the apartment for the better part of a decade, relishing its central location—between the Hudson River and Central Park. But he came to see the boring, under-40-square-foot bathroom as ho-hum. “I wanted it to look bigger,” he recalls.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>:</strong> He interviewed three Sweeten contractors and chose his <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contractor</a> based partly on his shopping advice. One of those suggestions led to a Long Island City showroom for the vanity and tiles used throughout.</p>
<p>The previous owner’s amateurish tiling got swapped out for new large-format tiles behind the vanity and toilet. That same tile continues into the shower stall, which replaced an old tub. Upgrades include frameless glass shower partitions and a low stone curb that allows the mosaic tile shower floor inside to slope, for drainage.</p>
<p>The replacement toilet has buttons for a water-conserving half-flush, a prized green-design feature. The contractor also suggested the website that yielded Charlie&#8217;s hardware and accessories. A final recommendation supplied the metal barn door hardware fitted on-site with a new white-painted panel door that matches others in the apartment.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>:</strong> Welcome energy is delivered by the owner’s idea of a pop of color: soft green paint for one bathroom wall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An awkward space turns sanctuary with a few simple ideas</h2>
<p>When a long apartment search finally ended, Victoria’s Secret designer Christine Yao returned to one of the first listings already crossed off her list. It was the one she ultimately closed on, and she was happy with her new home—except for her bathroom which felt like showering in a dark closet. An internet search led her to Sweeten and a match with a general contractor, who would help transform the space to echo the layout and feel of the baths she&#8217;d been pinning on Pinterest for months. With smart space reconfigurations (including a vintage sliding door) and good project management, he made it happen. In her own words, Christine tells the story, from how the thought of renovating scared her to the completion of her relaxing new dwelling.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21669 size-large" title="fashion designer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-600x900.jpg" alt="White bedroom" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><em>Guest post by East Village homeowner Christine Yao</em></p>
<p>I had been living on the Lower East Side for about five years when I started looking for a place to own. My weekends became a routine, waking up and planning errands around my StreetEasy open house schedule and any listings my real estate agent sent me. The beginning was packed, usually a few on Saturday and also Sundays when I walked all over downtown and viewed up to six apartments. You quickly realize that when you are focused on staying in a specific area—for me that was roughly LES/Chinatown/East Village—there are a limited number of places to see. At first, it seemed like there were hundreds of apartments for sale, and maybe 50 you can afford. You feel like half of the 50 may not even be worth seeing from the photos but you go see them anyway. A friend who had gone through the home-buying process made a comparison to online dating—one can only tell so much from the photos, you just have to go and see it in person to really know! A few months in, I had lost out on two places, and felt a little hopeless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #a69f3d;"><em><strong>&#8220;No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?&#8221;</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, finally, six months after I started looking, I had an accepted offer and closed on a co-op in the East Village. I had actually seen this apartment at the very beginnings of my search. My brother was in town on a Sunday when I dragged him from one open house to another. We thought the apartment was in an awesome location, and was a nice size. It needed some cosmetic work, but both agreed the bathroom was terrible. It had a wall right in the middle of it with the bathtub half concealed, so it felt like you were showering in a dark closet. It was cramped, with an awkward layout, and was just in bad shape. So I crossed it off the list. The idea of a bathroom renovation was overwhelming to me, on top of buying my first home. Then six months of searching made me re-think—maybe I could. No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21673 size-large" title="bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>So now, I had a bathroom to renovate, a living space that needed a refresh, and no idea where to start. The internet brought me to Sweeten. I liked how simple and straightforward it made finding a contractor: you <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project</a> and general contractors are matched for your job. I decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>—his work was most similar to the aesthetic I was going for and he had completed a project on Sweeten with a great review.</p>
<p>My plan for the entire apartment’s look was minimalist. I love a clean space that still feels warm and cozy. Greek cave hotels and Moroccan riads are a big inspiration for me. I did have a vision of wanting the apartment to feel like a vacation&#8230;somewhere tropical and feels relaxing when you are there. The kitchen, main living area, and two bedrooms just needed a redesign. But I couldn’t imagine my day-to-day in the previous bathroom—the door opening awkwardly, the dark shower, and not being able to enjoy a bath.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21714" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02 (1)" width="600" height="900" /></p>
<p>I was hoping the middle wall obstruction could be partially removed but we wouldn’t know if it was structural until the demo. Turns out the wall had all the building plumbing running through it, so needless to say, it had to stay. However, we found serious leaks happening on the floors above and below me (I am on the third floor of a five-story building), which the building would have to fix before we could move forward. Since pipes had to be replaced, the plumbing could be re-routed, allowing us to swap tub and toilet positioning. This worked out for the best: the toilet in a “nook,” and the bathtub by the window.</p>
<p>I had so many images on my desktop saved for ideas and realized they all had the common thread of black tile floors and clean, white walls with modern fixtures. I was getting a lot of inspiration from restaurant and hotel restrooms. I definitely wanted recessed lighting above the toilet (dimmers are a must for all lighting—mood!) and exposed plumbing under the sink for more leg room.</p>
<p>I ended up ordering almost everything on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>, which has phenomenal customer service by the way. I must have looked at hundreds of sinks. We realized it had to be a corner sink or you wouldn’t have enough space to get on and off the toilet. Then the toilet had to be an appropriate size. Measured twice, measure one more time, then cross my fingers when it came in. It all fit into this Tetris game of a bathroom! I wanted a sliding door that would let light through and found an old office door at Big Reuse in Gowanus, Brooklyn. My contractor cut it down to fit the doorway and painted it.</p>

<p>The renovation was running a couple months late due to waiting on permits, so taking things like a toilet and subway tile from Home Depot that were in stock was a priority. My Sweeten contractor was so easy to work with and made things stress-free on everything from dealing with the unexpected delays and permits to coordinating a time to receive a bathtub delivery. I also trusted his aesthetic and opinion on any design or materials questions I had.</p>
<p>As far as the rest of the apartment, it’s amazing what fresh paint and swapping out things like lighting, doorknobs, and some cabinet doors can do. He did a fantastic painting job and the white floors are my favorite feature of my home. My original budget was $25,000 for renovating the bathroom and repainting the apartment. I ended up going $4,500 overbudget because I live in a co-op. The process of getting permits and running into unforeseen issues with plumbing in-between the floors increased the costs and timeline. A six-week planned renovation turned into three months. I think it was really just me underestimating the cost of labor and materials, especially living here in New York City.</p>

<p>The bathroom turned out better than I could have hoped and I am so thankful for the successful renovation I had with my contractor through Sweeten. Now that I’ve experienced the process, the advice I can offer is to be prepared for it to take longer than you think. And add another month. Be prepared to spend a good chunk of time every day on it—coordinating with your contractor, arranging delivery times, looking for fixtures, going to check on things, etc. Be ready to laugh when things go wrong. And go wrong again. It’ll be worth it when you are enjoying your renovated place, I promise.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot about the kitchen—with all of my budget going to the bathroom and painting, I just took down the cabinet doors myself and painted. That’s a move I’ve done in many apartments I’ve lived in as a renter. It’s functional for now but I can’t wait to renovate this space next!</p>
<p>Thank you Christine, for sharing your story as a first-time homeowner and renovator! You proved that a few renovating ideas can make a big impact, and we love your fresh style.</p>

<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: Blane&#8217;s apartment overhaul is truly unforgettable. The post, originally published in 2016, showcases a mix of high-end materials and appliances paired with budget-friendly cabinets. An accountant by trade, Blane knows when to splurge and when to save, blending stock items with custom pieces throughout his home. Read on for a smart reno and play a fun game of &#8220;spot the pup!&#8221; in the photos below.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After “countless hours of watching HGTV,” Blane started to have big thoughts about ways he might make the kitchen and bathroom in his Ditmas Park/North Midwood condo better. While neither space was in particularly bad shape, he knew when he moved in that he would be plagued by a lack of light in the kitchen, and the bathroom felt mismatched to modern updates elsewhere in the apartment. With visions of a TV-worthy renovation, he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project on Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted contractors, and was introduced to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blane works in accounting at a law firm and is no stranger to budgets, so he was fastidious with his planning, choosing materials and fleshing out a game plan before even meeting with a contractor. With an initial budget of $35K, he planned to brighten the kitchen with cabinets in a lighter hue, substantially increase the limited counter space with an island, add a sliding door to the bedroom to keep the entry transition as efficient as possible, and cultivate a luxurious vibe in the master bath with an oversized walk-in shower and a neutral color scheme in place of its existing minty and slightly medical vibe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15588 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15590 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After extensive research and some early attempts at drawing out his own cabinet footprint, he got started with his contractor. First, the team decided to tackle the bathroom. Here, Blane got his inspiration from an unlikely place. “My first purchase was actually the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilet</a>, and things kind of evolved around there,” Blane said. “I’ve never had any sort of fancy toilet like that before. The new toilet has a remote, which I had never heard of. The Japanese are at the forefront of luxury so we’ll trust them.” The Toto toilet was just the beginning of the luxe vibe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blane chose a combination of slate and hexagon mosaic tiles for the wall, with a neutral mix of stone and wood for the heated (yes, heated!) floors. Then he pulled out all the stops with a walk-in, double-wide shower with a custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding glass door</a> and rain showerhead, plus a double sink vanity, in a bit of long-range planning to make the apartment cohabitation-friendly. The contractor&#8217;s team capped the detailed work with a slanted, but sturdy, bench design in the shower and herringbone tile design on the bathroom floor, all in a soothing gray palette.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34002 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x464.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="464" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34003 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-723x471.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="471" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34004 mb-0 size-chrono" title="shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-723x1069.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="1069" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, Blane chose white upper cabinets with gray base units, giving the space a brightened, more modern effect. After heavy research focused on IKEA, the contractor actually suggested Blane swap his blueprint for a similar cabinet option from Home Depot, which gave him the same lacquered and bright uppers, with a striated gray laminate bottom set. The team removed a wall and moved the oven to the other side of the cabinet line, opening up the kitchen and improving the flow for prep and serving. To give Blane even more space for culinary exploits (and entertaining), the team brought in an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> with a durable, waterfall quartz countertop with room for bar seating. Bonus: The island features its own electrical outlets, thanks to the contractor who snuck in a power source under a few floorboards.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the dining room, Blane purchased a stunning ghost wood table, handmade by Jim at <a href="https://www.breukelentafel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breukelen Tafel</a> in Carroll Gardens. To highlight the space, he and the team created a wallpapered accent wall to bring together the table, the gray walls, and the white and gray in the kitchen. “I think the wall, even though it was a simple thing, is now one of the best features of the apartment,” Blane said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34014 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-13-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blane admits that the process was mostly painless—despite living in the condo with a dog throughout the renovation. Though he went over his budget by 40 percent, he admits it was because of his decisions to choose more premium materials rather than any runaway labor costs. Even with the bathroom and kitchen in process at the same time, Blane was impressed that living in the rubble could be possible thanks to the team’s efforts to seal up the work zones and keep dust to a minimum. Looking at the finished product, Blane is thrilled. “I’m really happy it worked out,” Blane said. “Especially since I didn’t have a designer and I was relying on my accountant abilities to make good decisions.” Even though the contractor didn&#8217;t come from a design and build firm, his decades of experience let Blane lean on him for opinions and advice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But Blane’s best advice for anyone going into the process is to do as much research as possible and be prepared to adjust as challenges come up. Inconvenient issues can sometimes be opportunities: when a light problem with Blane&#8217;s closet or gaps between wall and ceiling tiles were discovered, the contractor came up with elegant solutions that often improved on the original plan. “They take great pride in their work, and even came back to do a touch-up here and there as things settled in the months after the project ended, at no additional cost,” Blane said. “If the final results don&#8217;t speak already for themselves, I highly recommend them.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Blane-Sliding-Door.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34018 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dark-brown-floor-brown-door" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Blane-Sliding-Door.gif" alt="dark brown floor and brown door and a staircase" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now Blane has the space to sprawl in his upgraded condo with one of Brooklyn’s most adorable dogs, his new pup, Harvey. However, he sheepishly admits he’s not always using that kitchen for intense, five-star-worthy fare. “I’m cooking now more than I was, but you get in that sandwich kick and it’s hard to change from that.”</p>
