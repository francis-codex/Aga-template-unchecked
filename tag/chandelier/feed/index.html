</a>Guest post by Nancy in her Upper East Side studio apartment</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Nancy&#8217;s first New York City apartment was a long time in the making—35 years to be exact. She searched for a dream home in Manhattan where she could apply the movie set design playing in her mind, but none of the spaces felt right. So Nancy, who works in human resources, took matters into her own hands and purchased a 550-square-foot studio apartment on the Upper East Side that hadn&#8217;t been touched since the &#8217;60s. Everything required an overhaul! To bring her vision to life, she made smart sacrifices in her narrow 6-foot-wide kitchen, turned a closet into a walk-in dressing room, and used wallpaper to carve out separate areas. You&#8217;ll want to read Nancy&#8217;s renovation journey.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I&#8217;ve lived in the city my whole life and have spent the last 35 years mentally cataloging my favorite buildings, blocks, and parts of the city. When I decided to buy my first place a few years ago, I was living in Chelsea—and loved it—but knew I need to shift my search further uptown to get more for my budget. I had always gravitated towards the Upper East Side and gone to open houses on and off over the years. If there&#8217;s an elevator, doorman building without in-window air conditioning units (my only real deal-breaker) in the East 70s, I&#8217;ve probably been there at some point. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The first apartment I saw on my search was in the same line I’m currently living in but on a lower floor. The apartment had been redone in a style that was fine but not my own, and the alcove was turned into a narrow bedroom cut off from heat and air conditioning. </span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Fast forward a few months and I&#8217;d been turned off by so many similar “I could live with it, I guess” renovations that I was determined to buy a place that would require a lot of work, knowing I might need to sacrifice space for the ability to make my place my own. I had loved the location, building, and low maintenance costs of that first place I&#8217;d seen months ago and found a studio apartment on StreetEasy that hadn&#8217;t been touched since the &#8217;60s, except for some new appliances–score! An offer was made, and I set out to renovate before moving in. I was excited that EVERYTHING required a refresh. My apartment is a decent-sized alcove studio—about 550 square feet—in a postwar Upper East Side high-rise. Since moving in, I&#8217;ve welcomed a fluffy new roommate named Hudson, who enjoys spending his days on the couch. We&#8217;re still working on getting him to embrace his dog bed.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I had heard about Sweeten from a few places—</span><span class="s1"><i>New York </i></span><span class="s1">magazine, Curbed, and even from a colleague who knew the founder—so it was the first place I turned to when looking for a contractor. I met with a few matches and had a ton of questions. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*What would this cost (or rather, can I do all this with what I want to spend)? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*How long would it take? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*How easy is it to get all my plans approved by my co-op board and the city? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I&#8217;d been dreaming of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1847" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this project</a> since I first discovered HGTV and had a pretty clear vision of what I had in mind: </span><span class="s1">a light and airy space&#8230;a dreamy beach house vibe that a character in a Nancy Meyers movie was tragically forced to squeeze into a tiny New York studio apartment (the “It’s Complicated” kitchen will have to wait). </span><span class="s1"> That said, I knew I needed a lot of help executing that vision and managing all of the pieces of a renovation that don&#8217;t find their way onto a Pinterest board. My Sweeten contractor was great at figuring out the best way to rewire the space, upgrade the electric panel, add in a ceiling light in the living space, inject new life to the parquet floors, and bring the plumbing up to standard.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">My contractor and I spent a ton of time playing with the footprint. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Should we close off the alcove?  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Turn the small linen closet into a new entrance for a dressing room/bathroom?  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Open up the kitchen and wrap the cabinets into the living space? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Expand both the closets into a small extra room and move the living space to the windows?  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Ultimately, we decided to keep the footprint as-is, but widen the kitchen entrance that led into the living space, reconfigure the walk-in closet to be more user-friendly with french doors, and turn the cramped sleeping area closets into an open dressing room. I was always excited about the storage in the apartment, but now it&#8217;s much more efficient. Everything is put away in its own place and the storage blends into the look of the space.  </span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The other big question was the kitchen layout. I dragged my mom—fresh off two of her own major kitchen renovations—to IKEA on multiple occasions to work out a footprint that would achieve two things in the small space: provide as much drawer storage as possible and add a dishwasher. After one particularly insane mock-up where I had almost convinced myself I could turn the 6-foot-wide space into a galley kitchen with a dishwasher drawer stacked over an oven (must have been Swedish meatball-induced temporary insanity), we realized <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom cabinets</a> were the way to go. Surprisingly, Home Depot came through with their Innermost collection where each piece could be semi-customized to bring the cabinets to the ceiling and turn a corner into usable space. I love that I was able to fit a shallow utensil drawer below the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">induction cooktop</a>. Choosing to forego the standard oven range was probably my most &#8216;controversial&#8217; decision—I really wanted that dishwasher—but I&#8217;ve come to love the induction top that fits into the countertop. The combo microwave/convection oven is perfect for my needs—it cooks just as well as most of the tiny apartment ovens and frees up a ton of space.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The rest of the decisions were mostly a balance between putting my stamp on the place and keeping resale in mind. I decided to go more traditional with the permanent kitchen and bath fixtures, but have more fun with the wallpaper, fabrics, lighting, and other decorative items. Using the Tanzania wallpaper print in the entryway helped define the space and kept with the black-and-white color palette. When I decided to keep the studio apartment as an open plan, I still wanted to keep the bedroom area defined as its own and the wallpaper from Flat Vernacular—which I’m in love with—does that well. It also keeps with the light feeling of the space. My contractor suggested molding with clean profiles—it&#8217;s actually just lumber—that works perfectly with the simple baseboards. I love the detail on the new <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doors</a> that have a simple style but give a bit of interest around the casing, which also helps relieve any warping with time. The floors were sanded down and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refinished</a> in a matte gray tone.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The cramped, shallow bathtub was replaced with a large shower, making the space feel more open and so much more functional—perfect for containing Hudson’s bathtime messes. The deep <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage cabinet</a> above the toilet was one of the few things I&#8217;d probably do differently as it was a gaffe on my part. I ordered the cabinet without paying attention to how far out it would protrude—it&#8217;s 10-inches deep—and was installed with tile around it before I realized. It&#8217;s not the end of the world, but using a shallow medicine cabinet would have been a better choice.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">As with any reno, there were some hiccups along the way with permits taking a long time to come through and building regulations stopping work for any and all holidays. The 60-year-old pipes burst downstairs onto some very understanding neighbors, and then from above onto my freshly renovated space about a week after everything was done! </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Sweeten was a great partner along the way. Once I posted my project, they helped me figure out what I could do with my budget and asked the right questions so I could evaluate the bids I received. </span><span class="s1">They were a great sounding board when faced with questions during the process, such as delays and increased costs. I definitely recommend any renovator to use the Sweeten team to understand all the moving pieces throughout the process. Having lived in my space for some time now, I love it, and there isn&#8217;t much I would do differently. I am getting the bug to renovate and decorate a new space. So who knows, maybe I&#8217;ll be calling Sweeten again soon with a new space to refresh!</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">From pendant lighting to LED strips, here&#8217;s a primer on kitchen lighting</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchen planning often seems to be concentrated on the “big” stuff—cabinets, appliances, that gorgeous stone countertop you’ve had your heart set on. Lighting is not exactly overlooked, but it typically plays a secondary role to the more expensive and showy features. However, lights are a pivotal part of what makes the elements of a room work, and work beautifully. This is particularly true in the kitchen, where the proper brightness needs to be effective </span><span class="s1"><i>and</i></span> practical, illuminating all the key areas of what is primarily a work environment. It should also bring to life the unique beauty of all the materials and details. A thoughtful mix of ambient, task, and accent lighting will do the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Begin your plan by re-examining how you use the kitchen and what you do where. Besides cooking and eating, it’s probably a room for socializing as well as office and schoolwork, and crafts or hobbies. Size, too will determine choice as well as placement. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ambient lighting</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also referred to as general lighting, this type of illumination serves to light the entire space while creating a welcoming mood. The lighting should be bright but diffused, not focused like task lighting (see below). Overhead recessed lighting is the most common choice to brighten the space and eliminate shadows and glare while creating a warm environment. Dimmers are a must, and will help you control the degree of brightness at any given point during the day or activity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your kitchen is small, a chandelier or group of pendants above the eating area along with an overhead light in the work triangle could do the job for general illumination. However, if your kitchen is very large, with one or more islands, and part of a great room, then recessed lights will also serve to brighten transitional spaces, like a hallway into the kitchen, or the area between the island and clean-up and cooking areas.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Task lighting</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essential for any area where work takes place, task lighting assures a safe place in which to cut vegetables, wash dishes, or pay bills for that matter. For long runs of countertop, undercabinet lighting such as LED strips are ideal: they are hidden from view and don’t shine in anyone’s eyes, even from a distance, and the light is directed right on the counter. LED strips or ropes also stay cool and last a long time before requiring replacement. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For an island or breakfast bar, you can install recessed spotlights, or opt for a pendant (or cluster of pendants), to bring warm, focused lighting when you want to switch to a softer atmosphere once the meal is ready. Pendants also allow you style statement opportunities, with plenty of choices for shades and bulbs, and arrangements. Plan to place these and recessed lights on dimmers, too, so you can readily control their intensity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will need focused light over the sink; if the basin is placed under a window, opt for a recessed light in the ceiling overhead that you can control with its own switch. This is a good light to leave on solo in the kitchen after dark, as it lights the way to get a glass of water or return a dish from an evening snack.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interior lighting is now available for drawers, too. LEDs, like <a href="https://www.hafele.com/us/en/" target="_blank">Häfele</a>&#8216;s Loox system, illuminate deep corners, so you don’t have to go digging for that errant fork.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Task lighting can also be served by a few well-placed lamps, say, a floor lamp in the corner of a dining nook where you might also sit to do paperwork or work on a laptop, or a table lamp in a small desk area, if you want a more furnished look.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Accent lighting</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name indicates, this type of lighting serves to single out features that deserve attention for their decorative qualities; it can also do double duty for task lighting. Most typical options are LED strips at the backs of shelves or cabinets to create a wash of light, highlighting dishware, glasses, or collections or an architectural detail like carved molding. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These strips also make a striking statement under the perimeter of a glass counter or a toe kick (the area between the base cabinet and the floor), to create visual interest and, in the case of the counter, keep someone from bumping into it late at night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>An important word about light switch placement</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan for light switches at each entry point to the kitchen, to light the way to your destination. Have separate switches installed for each light area—each individual task area as well as the general lighting—to provide the greatest flexibility. Make sure your contractor includes dimmers. You might also want to investigate electronic sensors for automatic control and safety at night.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When they began looking for more space, Chelsea residents Lauren and Ross didn’t want to move far from their Manhattan neighborhood. Luckily, they found a new home in Kensington House, an Art Deco co-op building just three blocks from their old place. The two-bed, two-bath apartment featured plentiful space for entertaining—a must for Lauren, a food industry professional, as well as the perfect nook for Ross’ piano. The baths in this Emory Roth-designed building were true to their 1930s roots, with out-of-style tiling, industrial flushometer toilets, and exposed radiator pipes that were an unattractive hazard. The couple tapped the interior design firm White Arrow to create hotel-inspired baths with more storage. Read also about their choice for color and a unique, space-saving pocket door solution.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband, Ross, and I purchased a two-bedroom apartment in Chelsea last year. We were already living in a one-bedroom apartment in the same neighborhood and wanted to upgrade to an apartment that had more space. After about three months of looking, we found the perfect apartment, only three blocks from where we were living.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the loft-style layout of the apartment we found, but the bathrooms were in a bit of a sorry state. The tile was outdated and one of the baths had a huge old-school metal tub stopper located next to the toilet. So we planned on gutting the two spaces along with a few extra upgrades, such as replacing the kitchen’s backsplash and lighting, sanding the floors, repainting the apartment, removing a desk in the study to accommodate a piano, and turning a less-than-ideal barn door in the dining foyer into a more discreet pocket door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We hired <a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Arrow</a>, a friend’s sister’s design company to assist us with the design process, and they, in turn, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our contractor</a>. Our Sweeten contractor was also very helpful throughout the design process and suggested modifications and tweaks to the original design that best fit our needs.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">Creating a wide barn pocket door proved to be a challenge but &#8220;our contractor suggested we attach three store-bought doors together&#8230;&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We initially budgeted two to three months for the renovation process, and typical for New York, ended up taking about four months. The apartment’s previous tenants took all of their light fixtures with them when they moved out, so we purchased new light fixtures for all of the rooms. I created a Pinterest board to help refine my ideas. We especially love the distinctive CB2 chandelier which hangs above our dining room table.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being a food writer and having written <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Kitchens-Behind-Burner-Hanoi/dp/B00AK2TMOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four Kitchens</a></em>, a book about working in restaurants around the world, it was important for me to have a clean, streamlined kitchen for cooking and entertaining. We loved the custom cabinets that were already in place but wanted to update the backsplash by installing white subway tiles to replace the existing small red-and-brown multicolored ones. We also swapped out the sink faucet for a contemporary Grohe fixture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ross loves playing piano, and with this apartment, we were finally able to accommodate a piano in our space. We removed a wooden plank which the previous owners had used as a desk and created a nook which was a perfect spot for an upright piano.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Creating the pocket door separating the dining area from the bedroom proved a bit of a challenge at first, but our contractor helpfully suggested that we attach three store-bought doors together, and then build a fake wall over what used to be the space for the barn door. This would be a more affordable solution than purchasing a custom wood door, which he noted would be very expensive. We then painted the door and surrounding walls Hamilton Blue by Benjamin Moore, a color we had in our old apartment, and one that we knew looked good as a backdrop for our artwork. Also in the dining area, we covered a pipe that had previously been exposed. We had initially wanted to get rid of it since it was in the middle of the walkway, but this was not possible. Our unit was originally two apartments that had been combined at some point in the past, and the pipe had been inside the dividing walls.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathrooms probably required the most work. Our designers initially suggested moving around the placement of the sink and toilet to maximize space, but this was going to require additional permits and more time. As such, we ended up leaving the tubs, sinks, and toilets in the same places, and just upgraded with new fixtures. I love taking baths so we got deep-soaking tubs for both bathrooms, as well as <a href="https://www.totousa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toto toilets</a>. For the master bath, I was inspired by the clean, elegant look of hotel bathrooms and wanted marble walls to be a focus of that space. We opted for a glass panel on the tub, which our contractor sourced for us. We also covered unattractive heating pipes with grates from <a href="https://www.archgrille.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Grille</a>. Custom shelving was added in the form of a shower niche, as well as a large in-wall cabinet opposite the sink.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the guest bath, a simple white tile with black grout was chosen to complement the Coyuchi shower curtain and an Of a Kind planter we had brought from our previous bathroom. We ran into some issues with the tiles purchased by our designers for the guest bath, so our contractor made suggestions that helped the material work in the space. Contemporary <a href="https://www.graff-designs.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graff shower fixtures</a> were selected for both showers. As for the color palette, we chose white because it was a neutral color, and it is just very soothing to have a white bathroom. Both looks are timeless, and we figured they would be appealing to us now and hopefully to anyone who bought the apartment later on.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the four months of work, we were able to move into our new space, which we now love. We tried to create a contemporary space that reflects our personal tastes while adding elements which also capture the Art Deco heritage of our apartment building.</p>
