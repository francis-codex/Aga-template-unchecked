<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are that once you find the right townhouse (good bones, ideal location, right price) in New York City, the space is going to need some work. After all, many of these houses—particularly classic brownstones—date back to the late 1800 and early 1900s. </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free service that matches homeowners with vetted general contractors, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">spoke to Sweeten’s founder and CEO, Jean Brownill, and <a href="https://www.compass.com/agents/chris-halliburton?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Halliburton</a>, associate broker of investment sales at <a href="https://www.compass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compass</a>, to put together a comprehensive guide about the questions to ask before you buy and how to get started on your townhouse renovation plan once the papers are signed, sealed, and delivered.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Questions to Ask During Your Search for a Townhouse</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for a townhouse to renovate, you probably already have an idea of the kind of home and lifestyle you’re looking to create. Perhaps you&#8217;re tired of neighbors stomping above you and dealing with your restrictive co-op board, or you are drawn to the dream of owning your very own roof terrace and backyard—aren’t we all? Or maybe you’d also like rental income to offset the cost of home ownership, or you’re an investor looking to maximize rental income.  Whatever your motivations, your townhouse renovation search should be narrowed to the properties that will allow you to create the lifestyle you’re looking for. Here are the questions to ask during your search.</span></p>
<h4><b>1.) What’s the building’s history?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where you gather information about the soundness of the property. New York City’s </span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/index.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Buildings (DOB)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a great site where you can look up the history of the property and see the violations, complaints, as well as applications and permits for prior work done to the property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for red flags, and use the information to determine whether prior work—especially structural changes or alterations to the plumbing, electrical, and mechanicals—has been executed properly. </span><a href="https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property Shark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is another place where you can access comprehensive, publicly available information about the property in question.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-brown-floor-white-kitchen" class="alignnone wp-image-31419 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12.jpg" alt="white kitchen with brown floor and white kitchen cabinets with recessed lights on ceiling after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) </em>AJ and Ray’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-townhouse-renovation-makes-a-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">townhouse renovation</a></span></p>
<h4><b>2.) What’s the actual square footage versus the buildable square footage?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many townhouses are on lots much larger than the current building footprint. For example, brownstones are often on 100-foot lots, but the building itself may only be 20’ x 35’. Chris explains that these properties can often be built back with extensions ranging from ten to 30 feet long, depending on the floor area ratio (FAR). The </span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/districts-tools/residence-districts-r1-r10.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAR is determined by the zoning designation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and in New York City, the Zoning Resolution designates ten residential districts. For example, a lot that is 20’ x 100’ in an R7-2 zone that has a FAR of 3.44 allows you to put up a 6,880-square-foot building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also be able to expand vertically. This is almost always a given, Chris says, although you may be constrained by landmark preservation requirements (see below). Similarly, you should explore excavation possibilities for creating a cellar. While below-grade space is not counted in the square footage, it is often useful to add space below for mechanicals or storage, even if it is not livable. By storing these elements underground, you can free up space above grade to maximize your living space and/or rental income potential.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29890 mb-10 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14.jpg" alt="townhouse renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"> <em>(Above)</em> Marsha and Adam&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">townhouse renovation</a></span></p>
<h4><b>3.) What are the existing conditions?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the information that you gather via city databases, pay attention to the existing conditions of the building. Are there signs of water damage, mold, or termites? Also be aware of outside forces beyond an owner’s control—is there a lot of ongoing or planned construction in the area?</span></p>
<p>If there is an empty lot next door, find out what is happening there. Chris points out that the construction of tunnels for the Second Avenue subway expansion was a major issue for surrounding properties, not only in terms of noise and inconvenience but also with structural damage related to shifting foundations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it currently a single-family dwelling that you intend to turn into a two-family? Or vice-versa? Be prepared to hire an architect if so.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1bZ07c4-A0&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40881 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h4><b>4.) Is the property landmarked or in a historic district?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/lpc/about/about-lpc.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landmark Preservation Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is New York City’s governing agency for preserving buildings and sites that are culturally, historically, and architecturally significant. Many brownstone townhouses happen to be in designated historic districts—there are a total of more than 36,000 landmark properties in 141 historic districts and extensions throughout the five boroughs, according to the LPC’s website.</span></p>
<p>If the townhouse you’re considering is protected, you will need to submit any planned changes to the LPC for review at the same time that you submit plans to the DOB. Chris explains, “Anything that the LPC approves will be approved 99 percent of the time by the DOB. But it’s not the case vice versa.” In particular, any changes to the façade will be scrutinized by the LPC. For example, while a back extension will not affect the view of the building from the street, adding floors will. If you want to add to the top of the building, you may be required to start 20 feet back from the front of the building, so that the additional floor can’t be seen from the street.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An LPC review will add extra time to your townhouse renovation, so this should be a consideration, especially if you are looking to bring in rental income on a deadline.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Financing Your Townhouse Renovation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obtaining financing for a townhouse purchase and renovation is essentially the same process as a condo purchase and renovation (co-ops are the outlier here). This is because a townhouse, like a condo, is real property. You can consult </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/financing-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this Sweeten guide on financing home renovations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are financing both the purchase of the property as well as the renovation, you have a few options (Jean advises consulting a professional to see what’s best for your situation).</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Apply for a construction loan and a permanent mortgage separately. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means you will need to research two separate loans and pay for two sets of closing costs. Some lenders only provide construction loans, while others will only make combination loans. Construction loans typically run for 12 months or less and are subject to an adjustable interest rate that resets quarterly or sometimes monthly.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>OR</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Apply for a construction-to-permanent loan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This combination instrument simplifies the process because you only need to take out one loan and pay closing costs once. It’s the more popular option for this reason. While construction is ongoing, you only pay interest on the outstanding balance, and then it is converted to a mortgage after the renovation is complete. You may, however, pay more for the permanent mortgage because the need for a combination has reduced your lender options.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25528 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-01.jpg" alt="townhouse doorway renovation " width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br /><span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) </em>Nazli and Larry’s  </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brownstone renovation</span></a></p>
<h3><strong>Who You’ll Need On Your Team</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When searching for a townhouse to renovate, it’s important to gather the experts who will not only help you get the job done right, but who can help you assess whether it’s a project worth tackling in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, you’ll need to line up several professionals early on, including structural engineers, electricians, and plumbers. Chris suggests that you bring these pros in for site visits prior to signing the contract so that you don’t “end up buying a money pit.” He estimates that you could have all these consultations done for roughly $1,500 to $2,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to general contractors, Jean understands firsthand the importance of having a professional you can trust. “When I started to renovate my own Brooklyn brownstone, I ended up hiring the wrong general contractor,” she said. “If I can make a wrong choice, anyone can.” She started Sweeten to help homeowners find licensed and vetted contractors and to ultimately renovate fearlessly to create a home they love.</span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639150923230"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is a townhouse?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A townhouse is a common style of housing in cities and suburbs. Townhouses tend to be multi-floor units with private entrances. Townhouses share one or more walls with adjoining townhouse units; which differentiates them from single-family homes. Townhouse units may have small front or back yards, balcony spaces, or covered porches. </p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639150942067"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is the difference between a condo and a townhouse?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A “condo” (short for condominium) is a style of housing usually located within a community of buildings owned by individuals. A “condo” community may have shared amenities like a gym, pool, garden, or adhere to rules set by an HOA. A townhouse is a style of home; generally multi-floor with shared walls with other townhouses. If a townhouse is located within a community of similar homes, it may qualify as a condominium.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a renovation buff like the rest of us at Sweeten, you might be dreaming of buying (and of course, renovating) your own piece of real estate. A crucial step in turning that dream into reality? Securing a mortgage. Here&#8217;s the lowdown:</span></p>
<h3>Qualifying standards</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First-time homebuyers are often overwhelmed by the process and the sheer volume of paperwork involved, but finding a reliable mortgage professional to walk you through the process is key. Even before you shop around for experts, however, you should have a sense of your own finances. This means knowing that you know the answers to the following questions:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have a good (preferably over 700) or great credit score (typically 800 and above)?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much money do you have in the bank?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much monthly debt do you have compared to your monthly income?  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answers to these questions will give you an idea of how easily you’ll be able to get the mortgage you want. The best candidates have a good credit score, money in the bank (for a healthy down payment of at least 20 percent*), a strong salary (to pay the monthly costs), and an acceptable level of debt, explained further below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortgage bankers work with different formulas to determine the home loan amount that you qualify for, and different lenders will use varying standards. Two of the most significant, however, are the payment-to-income ratio (“housing expense ratio”), and the debt-to-income ratio (or “debt service ratio”).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Housing Expense Ratio</b></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: On a conventional Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac loan, the monthly mortgage payment (including the principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) cannot exceed a certain percent of your income (usually around 28 percent). So for example, if your gross income is $4,000 a month, your house payments cannot amount to more than $1,120 a month. There are exceptions: for loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA-insured loans”), the percentage allowed is higher, whereas loans guaranteed by the Department of Veteran Affairs (“VA-guaranteed loans”) do not consider the payment-to-income ratio at all but instead look at residual income. </span><span class="s1">[Total Income x 28% = Total Housing Expenses | EXAMPLE: $4,000 x 28% = $1,120]</span><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Debt Service Ratio</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: With a conventional home loan, your recurring debt total cannot exceed a certain percent of your monthly income (usually around 36 percent). This includes your housing payments (determined above). So continuing with the example above, if you make $4,000 a month, you are allowed a total monthly debt of $1,440. Subtracting your mortgage payment, that gives you $320 to pay all of your other recurring debts, including any student loans, credit cards, car payments, etc. As with the housing expense ratio, special loans have more forgiving percentages. On an FHA-insured loan, your debt cannot exceed 43 percent of your monthly income, whereas, on a VA-guaranteed loan, your debt cannot exceed 41 percent of your monthly stable income. </span><span class="s1">[Total Income x 36% = Total Monthly Debt Allowed | EXAMPLE: $4,000 x 36% = 1,440]</span></p>

<h3>Getting pre-qualified or pre-approved</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a competitive market like New York City, it’s important to start the mortgage process even before you start looking at homes. It’s generally expected that, if financing is required in your home purchase, a pre-qualification or pre-approval letter accompanies the offer. So what does it mean?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Pre-qualification</b></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be considered “pre-approval-lite”—it is usually provided after you have a quick chat with your lender about your big-picture finances. They don’t do an in-depth analysis or a credit check but can give you an estimate of the amount that you’d qualify for. A pre-qualification can take as little as 30 minutes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Pre-approval</b></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is more complex and requires you to supply the lender with documentation of your income and debt (rather than just providing it verbally, as with pre-qualification). This includes W-2s, tax returns, bank statements, paystubs, and more. (Get organized now! This information is much easier to gather if it’s not all in an unsorted pile under your bed.) It also involves an extensive check into your finances and credit. At the end, you receive a conditional commitment for the exact amount they are willing to loan you in a pre-approval letter. This letter strengthens any offer because it assures the seller that you can very likely obtain the actual funding. A pre-approval will usually take at least a whole business day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If at all possible, get a pre-approval: “Most pre-qualification letters are not worth the paper they are written on, because nothing has been verified. With a pre-approval, credit, assets, and income are verified, allowing the lender to approve you for a home loan based on what you qualify for,” explains Romuald Solages, a mortgage loan officer at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.phsloans.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerHouse Solutions</a>, a direct lender for mortgages to the consumer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span class="s1">In competitive markets, such as NYC, getting a pre-approval places you in a stronger position should you find yourself in a bidding war. It will take a little longer but it’s part of the process if you are serious about buying property with a mortgage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this means that you should speak with a mortgage broker or banker </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">prior</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to going to that open house (easier said than done, we know.) This process gives you an accurate estimate of how much house you can afford, based on how much you have for a down payment, as well as your financial history. Plus, once you’ve done this, you’ve drastically simplified the steps needed to take once you have an accepted offer since the lender will already have much of the information required for your application. You may need to update the info if a lot of time has passed, but you won’t be starting from scratch.</span></p>
<h3>Where to find a mortgage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have to stick to your current bank for a mortgage. &#8220;Many people falsely assume that they will fare much better with their mortgage if they just use their established bank, the one they already do their banking with,&#8221; says Romuald. While many banks do advertise programs for their customers,  he adds, &#8220;it’s always best to shop around.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">There are the national lenders, like Wells Fargo and Chase, but also reputable local companies like FM Loans and Freedom Mortgage. Keep in mind you are working with specific loan officers/bankers and not just an institution, and as with attorneys and agents, many people use personal references such as friends and family. Your real estate agent should be the first place you go to for suggestions if you have no contacts. Other sources include a mortgage banker or a mortgage broker—the latter are much less common after the financial crisis. The former works directly for a lender (e.g., a bank), where your loan originates, whereas the broker is a middleman, who shops around for you and connects you to a lender.</span></p>
<h3>What if…</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">*You don’t have 20 percent to put down</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? While that amount is recommended in today’s market, most conventional lenders will allow you to put down as little as 10 percent (unless you are applying for a special program, such as the FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed loans). With 10 percent down, however, you will still be required to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI), which you can avoid by putting down at least 20 percent. FHA loans, which require a down payment of just 3.5 percent, are a good option for those who don’t have a lot of cash in the bank.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">*You don’t have good credit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, FHA loans may be the answer here. Because the FHA insures the home loans, they lower the risk for the lender, allowing them to be more lenient with both the size of the down payment as well as the borrower’s credit score. The minimum FHA loan credit score is 580, which means that the borrower would qualify for maximum financing under their standards with a down payment of just 3.5 percent. If your credit score is lower than 580, you can still qualify, but will be required to put down 10 percent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s important to examine your credit reports carefully because any mistakes on your credit report could lead to a higher mortgage rate or even loan rejection. Checking your credit report with all three major credit bureaus—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—is free through annualcreditreport.com,” says Romuald. </span></p>
<h3>Buying and renovating all-in-one loan</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in buying to renovate, consider applying for one loan to cover both. This simplifies the process by allowing you to do just one financing application, with only one set of closing costs. The lender will calculate how much of a mortgage you’ll qualify for based on the future value of the property, so you’ll be able to obtain a larger amount than if it was based on the current value. There is in this case also an FHA option, known as an </span><a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/203k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FHA 203(k) loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
