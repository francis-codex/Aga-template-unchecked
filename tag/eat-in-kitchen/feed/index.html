										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Dining in style, from kitchen tables to islands with seating</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the eat-in kitchen, the “eat-in” part is usually the last piece of the puzzle. Kitchen design typically revolves around cooking while the notion of dining in the space is often an afterthought. However, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a renovation platform connecting homeowners to a vetted general contractor, has seen a growing trend in considering both activities during the design stage. While small spaces demand multiple functionality in the kitchen, a more thoughtfully layout combines seating, a more organic flow, and space planning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Explore the possibilities that these Sweeten homeowners undertook with their eat-in kitchens, from dining tables to counter seating. All will invite family and friends to &#8220;break bread&#8221; with you at home!</p>
<h3>A kitchen banquette beckons for company</h3>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43214" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg" alt="kitchen banquette" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With only one window in the kitchen to let in light, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/duplex-remodel-first-time-renovators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenn and Jon</a> took steps to create a brighter atmosphere for their family of four. A partial wall that sectioned off an eat-in area from the kitchen came down effectively joining the two spaces and letting the sunshine stream in. Cooking and eating together were top priorities and a U-shaped banquette lent a cozy gathering spot around the square-shaped dining table. Wallpaper and paneling give it separation and personality.</p>
<h3>A peninsula bar multitasks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41636" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="dining nook" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-riverdale-bronx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth and Martin</a>’s 124-square-foot galley kitchen, tackling the space planning and bringing a sense of openness was done with the help of their Sweeten design-build team. The couple&#8217;s comfort level for all of the renovation changes was put at ease with “sketches from every angle.” Pulling down two partial walls was step one in bringing in more light. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new peninsula bar seats four to five stools reminiscent of a cute bistro—and holds storage. Form and function increase with more prep space, glass-front cabinets, and a mix of finishes. Clutter minimizes with the microwave tucked behind a cabinet and the paper towel holder rolls out from under the countertop.</span></p>
<h3>More function for a larger kitchen</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42916" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1.jpg" alt="Townhouse renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/apartment-vs-house-a-brooklyn-family-decides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jill and Cy</a> created an open concept on the first floor of their single-family townhouse. The kitchen was expanded for the family of four by turning a full bath into a powder room giving more exposure to the black-trimmed doors leading to the backyard. With ample room, a dining table and chairs fit easily in the cook space for meals and entertaining. The flat-panel walnut cabinetry, ceiling light fixture, and furniture displayed the mid-century modern aesthetic. A cut-out window seat that doubles as storage was a bonus feature.</span></p>
<h3>Centerstage for an island</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40332 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="s1">A salvaged slab of walnut picked up at a reclaimed wood supplier took centerstage in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara and Brian</a>’s kitchen. “I remember when I was a kid, the kitchen island was the center of existence,” she said. Aiming for the rustic look, two sides were live edge while the wood’s cherry red tone was lacquered. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The refrigerator was relocated within a row of existing closets off the kitchen proper creating a unified flow for the rest of the apartment. A disguised pantry covered in subway tile is a fun “Where’s Waldo?” moment. And that walnut slab? There was enough left over to fashion open shelving for the kitchen, home office, and the bathroom.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42357" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg" alt="studio loft kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A kitchenette found new life in its studio loft with new <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/midtown-remodel-industrial-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowners Serge and Uldis</a> who worked to make full use of all of the space available. Situated underneath the loft, a small dining table and chairs enhance the cozy grotto feel. Opting for an L-shaped layout, appliances moved along the back wall giving room to install plenty of countertop surface. A mix of stainless steel and white cabinets are backdrops to a glossy black tempered glass backsplash. </span></p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovate a builder-grade kitchen in Philadelphia</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The birth of the couple&#8217;s first child came two weeks after purchasing a two-story rowhouse in Philadelphia’s Graduate Hospital neighborhood. The baby’s arrival meant that plans to renovate the builder-grade kitchen would have to be put on hold. Fast forward two years later, with another baby on the way, this growing family decided to squeeze in the much-needed renovation before the due date. The kitchen was in dire need of a change: remodeled in 2004, it had generic faux wood cabinets, inefficient appliances, limited storage, and a lack of natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34743 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-Before-01-723x722.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia" width="723" height="722" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: As a couple who loves to cook and dine in their eat-in kitchen, the homeowners wanted to make it brighter and more efficient. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/26307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on Sweeten were matched with a general contractor. “[The kitchen] gets a LOT of use as the main backdrop for our lives,” the homeowner explained. The biggest change on the list of must-haves was the relocation of the exterior door to another wall in order to make room for a seating nook. To boost the flow of sunlight, a new window was planned for the spot where the old door originally stood. Inspired by the homeowner’s experience working in museums, the new kitchen, with flat-front all-white cabinets, unobtrusive hardware, and few distractions on the countertops, would feel similar to the clean backdrop of an empty gallery space; bright and full of potential.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34752 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-08-723x1012.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, white quartz countertops, white cabinets, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="1012" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The white quartz <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a> and backsplash create a clean backdrop while the emerald green <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tile </a>adds plenty of character. Most of the improvements in the kitchen—a trash can tucked behind a cabinet door and drawers beneath the sink—felt like the missing pieces of the puzzle. New <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appliances</a>, including a smaller refrigerator taking up less space and a range hood that vents outside instead of recirculating air inside, are all energy-efficient.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34746 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, white quartz countertop, white cabinets, seating nook" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34747 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, seating nook, white cabinets" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The first-time renovators discovered you may not know what you&#8217;ll find behind the walls in your home. In the process of moving the entrance, their Sweeten contractor opened up the walls and uncovered missing overhead support beams, structurally unsound vertical supports, mysterious gaps of empty space, and interior-grade drywall behind the exterior siding instead of plywood. He patiently and quickly worked to solve the serious problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34755 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-11-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, range hood, white quartz countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34749 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, white quartz countertop, range hood, white cabinets" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fixing the issues behind the walls extended the timeline from 2-3 months to 6 months. The baby was born in the middle of it all, but now that work is done, the family has peace of mind knowing their home is structurally sound. “We love our new kitchen,” the homeowner tells us, “We realize that while it might be too monochrome for some, it&#8217;s exactly what we wanted.”</p>
