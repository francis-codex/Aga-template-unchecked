<p style="text-align: justify;">No matter how well you prepare, renovating your home can still seem like a daunting task. The unexpected tends to happen when you least expect it, so take advantage of the hard-won knowledge gleaned by our Sweeten homeowners. We asked them to share their advice for future renovators, listed below. Whether you are planning your first project or are an experienced renovator, these home remodeling tips will help guide you on the path to a successful renovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33305 size-chrono" title="apartment renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls01-723x482.gif" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 1: Find pictures of rooms with your planned paint color</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tracking down real-life examples of paint colors used within rooms <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-condo-divides-and-conquers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enabled Sophie to nail down</a> the palette for her renovation. Seeing paint samples in person and within 3-D renderings was helpful, but there&#8217;s more to it. &#8220;You’re not really sure how it feels until you actually see the space in person,” she said. As a solution, Sophie found photos of rooms online that were painted in the same shades she had selected. &#8220;We ended up picking up all the inspiration books and samples we could find at the hardware store; then I’d compare all the colors to pictures on Pinterest, going back and forth on nearly identical shades.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32378 size-chrono" title="gray-panelled-glass-door-white-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13-723x1085.gif" alt="gray panelled glass door over white counter and white bar stools after renovation " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13-723x1085.gif 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13-200x300.gif 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13-600x900.gif 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 2: Don&#8217;t forget the small details while planning ahead</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning ahead is crucial, and it&#8217;s something that many homeowners post-renovation will emphatically recommend to future renovators. &#8220;It’s better to have all your ideas on paper before you begin, from important aspects like flooring and appliances to the small details that are easy to overlook, such as cabinet hardware, paint colors, lighting fixtures, and electrical outlets. Having this mapped out will make your life and your contractor’s life much easier during the renovation,&#8221; Heather and Eric said, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/with-this-reno-i-thee-wed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following their apartment remodel</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32171 size-chrono" title="white-pillar-dining-table" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-723x1085.jpg" alt="white pillar near dining table with chandelier in ceiling and brick wall after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-585x878.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 3: See your finishes— counters, molding, and more—in person</h3>
<p>After <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-duplex-renovated-for-a-new-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redoing her living room</a> and bringing the dining area into the kitchen, Rachel said she now understands how important it is to see finishes in person before making any decisions. &#8220;It’s really difficult to imagine what crown molding, counters, or other elements look like (in real-life) on a computer screen.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Sari-Resnick-Bathroom03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31376 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Sari-Resnick-Bathroom03-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 4: Estimate how fixtures will fit into rooms—and how you&#8217;ll use them</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you&#8217;re thinking about the big picture, don&#8217;t let the smaller details slip through the cracks. Once <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/desperately-seeking-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sari renovated her bathroom</a>, she shared a few tips for a successful remodel: &#8220;Make note of where your towel bars are and where they should be so that they are at a comfortable height. Also, check which side of the toilet you want your flusher on, because you can’t change that.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33697 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 5: Use your belongings to make more accurate measurements</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combining her apartment</a> with the one next door, Zoe noted that ironing out the details, like knowing how big the closets and drawers should be, will keep your project moving along smoothly. “Measure everything and live the design in your head. Know how many linear feet of closet you need and where you might store the vacuum cleaner. This is especially helpful for the kitchen design.” She also measured the maximum size of her pots so she could find drawers that were the right height.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-32951 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen12-1-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Tracey McFarland Kitchen12 (1)" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen12-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen12-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen12-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen12-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen12-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You’ve been eyeing the possibilities of having a lawn, an extra bedroom, and maybe even a man or woman cave. When you go to look at houses, you come back to your apartment feeling just a little bit more cramped.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s exciting to think of buying a house. New spaces and new neighborhoods present new possibilities. But what does it really take in terms of cost to transition from an apartment to a house and what can you do to get on the right path from the start?</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1000-Apt-to-House.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31958 mb-0 size-chrono" title="house costs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1000-Apt-to-House-723x189.jpg" alt="buying a house" width="723" height="189" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s begin with the basics: Your fixed costs will be your property tax, mortgage, and insurance. Then there are the unplanned scenarios with maintenance, mechanicals, and energy as the main areas of focus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To improve your return, you&#8217;ll want to be on the lookout for potential runaway costs. Here&#8217;s how you can reduce your unknowns even before you close.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT CAN HAPPEN:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You own the whole enchilada</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It can be a rude awakening when your pipe bursts, and instead of calling the super, you’re the one standing in the water waiting for the plumber to come. A house means responsibility for the whole structure, not just a piece of it. If something goes wrong, whether it’s the foundation, roof, supports, or siding, it can be costly, as well as time-consuming, to deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consider the age of the home and all the components</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That 1890’s house with the period details and original woodwork is so seductive, but while you are swooning, note the ages of the roof, boiler, siding, etc. and also the replacement costs. Underestimating the replacement costs and schedule can leave you utterly unprepared financially.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Consider this true story: a pair of homeowners bought a big Victorian with great bones at a steal of a price. Sounds like a great investment in theory. But when it came time to replace the slate roof two years later, they discovered that each 20-foot-square area would cost $10,000, or $120,000 for the whole surface, which turned their good investment on its head.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To reduce your risks, make a list of all major components, their ages, <a href="https://www.nachi.org/life-expectancy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their expected lifespan</a>, and whether they are in or out of warranty. Doing this before deciding on a home to purchase will make your comparison of potential homes as investments much more informed!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1000-Project-Graph-6-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31850 mb-0 size-chrono" title="house comparison" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1000-Project-Graph-6-3-723x390.jpg" alt="buying a house" width="723" height="390" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>WHAT CAN HAPPEN:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Size matters</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Big, Mediterranean-style homes with parlors and bedrooms galore can make apartment dwellers green with envy. But the bigger the house, the higher the energy and maintenance costs. Also, freestanding houses have more sides to maintain than townhouses and are more expensive to heat, cool, and keep up.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Get data on energy costs and make a plan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What does it cost to heat and cool the home you are looking to buy? Energy costs are one of the major costs that homeowners have every month. For example, if the house you have is running a 40-year-old gas boiler with shoddy insulation and window-unit air conditioners, the energy costs will be very different from a well-insulated home with a new energy-efficient HVAC system. Energy costs will vary according to season and climate, of course.</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to ask for ballpark energy costs from the current owners and also do your own research given the type of heating and cooling units and square footage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Learn the lifespan and replacement costs of your energy-related components, including the windows, skylights, heating and cooling systems, insulation, and type of energy used. What can you plan to upgrade that will pay for itself? Homeowners often have a lot of opportunities to make strategic energy upgrades because improving energy systems have a direct effect on lowering costs, making the return on investment higher.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency upgrades have some of the highest returns on investment of any home improvement project.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT CAN HAPPEN:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quality</strong> <strong>counts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Are you considering buying a brand new house? You may very well pay zero in home maintenance during your first year and get years and years of use out of your roof, HVAC system, water heater, and appliances. Compare that with a home that is 50 years old where the mechanicals haven’t been replaced recently and you’ll see a very different outlay of cash for maintenance in the early years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be aware that over time, quality matters much more than age. A solidly built home will beat a shoddily built home any day of the week in terms of return. It’s best to take age into account when figuring out your costs but look at the overall quality of construction as well, especially if you plan to remain in the home a while. A new home that is poorly made may be less expensive initially, but you could really pay down the road if there are structural issues due to poor construction or you have to replace a lot of the finishings and details because corners were cut on quality.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Don’t skimp on home inspections</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s standard practice to have an inspection of the home before you close on it. The timing for inspections and extra due diligence differs among states. In some states, due diligence is done after a contract is signed during an agreed upon time period, and in others, it occurs before a contract is signed. It&#8217;s best to consult a local real estate agent to get an overview and get advice from a real estate lawyer in your area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be aware that some inspectors are more thorough than others and different types of homes have different kinds of potential issues. Each house will be viewed based on their own issues. You should always be at the inspection; don&#8217;t have your real estate agent go instead of you. A regular home inspection can take anywhere from 20 minutes for an apartment to an hour and a half for a large property and home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s best to ask around for an inspector who is known to be notoriously tough and thorough. Usually, your real estate agent can recommend one. And always rely on the buyer&#8217;s agent (your own) for the recommendation, not the seller&#8217;s agent!</p>
<p>Next, figure out what the major risks are for the particular type of home you are buying. A home inspection consultation will cost $300-$1,000+. This cost varies depending on your home type, the different inspections you&#8217;re looking for, and your location.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1000-Project-Graph-6-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32333 mb-0 size-chrono" title="home inspection costs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1000-Project-Graph-6-585x149.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="149" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1000-Project-Graph-6.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1000-Project-Graph-6-300x76.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, old brownstones often have issues with cast iron sewer pipes running under the home and out to the city sewer line. Having the pipes thoroughly inspected could save you a $40,000 cost later on if the basement needs to be torn up and pipes replaced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In another example, a quick, visual inspection may not detect termite damage if there is no exposed wood to examine in a completely finished basement. A more thorough termite inspection could save you a huge repair cost that isn’t generally covered by homeowners insurance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A home inspector doesn&#8217;t do a full inspection on a chimney, and if having a fully functional chimney is important to you, it might pay to have it inspected, as it can often cost between $10,000-$15,000 if bricks have to be reworked and repaired. An inspection can make sure the brick inside the chimney isn&#8217;t crumbling and that smoke is being discharged properly for around $300.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are looking at a property that has a well, consider getting it thoroughly inspected to determine the depth of the water table and the quality of the water. There can be contaminants in the groundwater that could affect your health as well as the resale value of your property in the future. This costs $325 on average, but you can also pair it with a septic inspection and get it all tested for around $500 on average.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1000-Project-Graph-9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32017 mb-0 size-chrono" title="inspection cost versus repair cost comparison" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1000-Project-Graph-9-723x316.jpg" alt="buying a house" width="723" height="316" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if you don&#8217;t have a well, you might consider having the soil tested for contaminants if you have reason to be concerned about possible environmental hazards. Land that has had industrial uses in the past, fracking, and other situations, such as being located near the former site of a gas station, could pose a hazard to you and your family, affecting your health, causing expensive remediation, and affecting the resale value of your property. Testing costs $400 and up, depending on the complexity of the testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While a home inspector will look at the foundation and note the type of construction, they won&#8217;t be able to tell if there&#8217;s a problem. A foundation engineer can tell if it is faulty or potentially unstable. Repair can run in the tens of thousands of dollars, so if you suspect foundation issues—compromised by flooding or possible unstable ground conditions—paying the relatively low fee for a foundation inspector, around $300-$400, can save you a lot of money and headaches.</p>
<p>Seriously reconsider the purchase if any of the following turn up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major roof issues</li>
<li>Major construction quality issues</li>
<li>Termite damage</li>
<li>Soil contaminants</li>
<li>Other environmental issues such as water quality</li>
<li>Foundation issues</li>
<li>Previous property flooding</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The point is, don’t be shy to ask for additional inspections! In extremely competitive markets, it can be tricky as bidding wars and cash-only offers with no inspection contingencies can be de rigueur. Even so, try to protect yourself as much as possible by looking for and identifying potential issues as best you can. You are not being unreasonable; you are protecting your investment.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nice yards need work</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may have big dreams of rolling around on your expansive lawn, but it’s good to be realistic about the amount of time, effort, and money it takes to landscape (hint: a lot). Those Japanese Feather Oaks and mulched flower beds do need regular tending and new homeowners often underestimate the maintenance involved to keep even a small yard weed-free and looking lush.</p>
<p><strong>Insurance that fits your needs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners insurance isn’t a one-size-fits-all situation. Because you are responsible for a whole building as a homeowner, read through your declaration page carefully and ask a lot of “what happens if” questions. Look for insurance that covers the full replacement cost of the home, since mortgage companies sometimes require you only cover the loan amount. Be sure to cover the full 100% of the replacement value of the building to protect your share.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also consider how much liability insurance you feel comfortable having if someone were to slip and fall on your walkway or get bit by your giant, yard-guarding Rottweiler, for example.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have the skinny on the expected costs, you can do a more accurate comparison when deciding between two properties. Home buying is an emotional decision, but that doesn’t mean you can’t also have a great financial result for your next chapter!</p>

</a>Homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marsha and Adam</a> with their two daughters</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They say the best way to learn is by experience. After that, the second-best way to learn is by talking to people who have been in your shoes. Sweeten homeowners emerge from the renovation process with more than a few &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moments and generously share their hard-won renovation advice with our readers on the blog. We’ve gathered some of their most meaningful advice below. Wherever you are in your renovation journey, we hope this insight will help as you create your very own home sweet home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29012 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom05-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 1: Measure around your belongings for the most accurate spacing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-work-triangle-sets-off-a-brooklyn-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this homeowner’s kitchen</a> were too shallow; in fact, closing the cabinet doors had chipped most of her plates. When it came time to renovate, deeper cabinets were a must. If you’re planning a kitchen renovation, this homeowner shares the following advice: “Measure all your cookware and then use those measurements to design your kitchen cabinets. It made us feel a little OCD to do this, but it really paid off.” Even if you plan on buying stock cabinets vs. custom-made, measuring the interiors to make sure that all of your cookware will fit is a smart move.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30430 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 2: Short on time? Order materials as early as possible.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to make a tight timeline work, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-moody-bath-for-a-getaway-home-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nate and Michelle</a> recommend that future renovators order materials as soon as possible. “Make sure you have all the pieces before starting. That includes the tile, fixtures, vanities, toilets, and even the little things like towel hooks and toilet paper holders. That way, you can avoid delays while waiting for some piece to come in,” Nate said. Purchasing stock items versus custom or special order will make it easier to stay on schedule. At Sweeten, we see homeowners placing orders for materials without consulting with their contractor on the timeline, which can cause major project delays, so this is sage advice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29713 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 3: Prepare for paint hues to look different on your walls</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the major lessons that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/1920s-westchester-home-gets-a-modern-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooke</a> learned while renovating is that paint colors never look the way you expect them to look once they’re on the walls of your home. “I had eight swatches of gray and greige paint on the [kitchen] walls for weeks and finally decided on Wickham Gray from Benjamin Moore. The day the contractor was painting the kitchen, I was working from home. I came downstairs to see a neighbor, and she immediately said, ‘I didn’t know you were going green in the kitchen.’ So we turned around and went with Gray Owl [another Benjamin Moore paint] instead,” Brooke said. The takeaway: if there’s a tint, or a hint of another color, visible from the paint swatch, expect it to have a much bigger effect on your space when your walls are painted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29899 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 4: Soundproofing can be worth the expense for privacy and comfort</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Soundproofing is rarely noticeable—it’s essentially invisible—but the role it plays can have an enormous impact on your daily life. “Paying more for soundproofing the bathroom (so you don’t hear anything from your bedroom) is worth every penny,” <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marsha</a> said. “We really appreciated our Sweeten architect telling us that we ‘needed’ those more expensive items—she was right.” Of course, you don’t have to soundproof your bathroom, but if you can fit it into your budget, this extra step elevates the comfort of your home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28698 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 5: Conserve funds in parts of your budget to help pay for unexpected issues</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sticking to your budget can be difficult, especially when quality is your top priority. However, doing so pays off when something unexpected happens—like discovering that you need more materials than you budgeted for. When considering brands of non-toxic paint, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/original-details-brooklyn-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah</a> looked at high-end options first before choosing a budget-friendly brand. The economically priced VOC-free paint turned out to be a smart decision. “Our plaster walls drank up the paint and we ended up having to buy 25 gallons when we originally budgeted for ten,” said Sarah. Since she chose an affordable option from the get-go, the extra gallons of paint didn’t break the budget.</p>
