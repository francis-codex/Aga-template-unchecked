<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When avid entertainers embark on an apartment renovation, it’s sure to lead to greatness in the kitchen. That was the case in this 1940s Brooklyn co-op that Jessica, a brand strategist from London, and Jesse, a filmmaker and content producer from Queens, bought together soon after getting married. The couple planned to renovate the 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom home, with their primary focus on increasing the functionality of the cooking space and storage in other rooms.

<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Jessica</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our story begins when we started looking for a home, and specifically a kitchen<i>,</i> we could love. We were living happily in Brooklyn in a one-bedroom rental, but after we got married, investing in an apartment for the long-term was our goal. We noticed that well-renovated places coming on the market were triggering bidding wars and started thinking about buying an apartment to redo. Being big foodies, we got excited to build a beautiful kitchen to cook in.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We came across a cluster of buildings called the Clinton Hill Co-ops and were attracted by the generous square footage of the apartments, which were built in the mid-20th century. When a two-bedroom needing updates became available, we snapped it up. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’d hired <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Sweeten contractor</a>, along with our team from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amyblumenthal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blumenthal Architecture and Interiors</a>. We planned to open up the kitchen to the living room and add a peninsula where we could prepare food or just hang out. Plumbing would be relocated for a better cooking layout. However, a partition surrounding the existing refrigerator closed off the kitchen, disrupting flow. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The solution: Demo the partition and move the fridge, thereby creating space for a six-foot peninsula. It was designed with full-length drawers for pans and dinnerware, built-in shelves at the end of the peninsula for cookbooks, and toe-level kick-drawers, which let us utilize every inch. It also has a wine fridge! We went for under-cabinet lighting and pull-out components: a pantry, spice rack, and garbage bin. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/colourfulstef/"><span class="s5">Stef Steen,</span></a> a color specialist based in the UK, helped us make minimalist palettes with touches of strong color for soul. Our cabinets are custom, the uppers in white and lowers in dark royal blue. People say not to mix shaker and flat-front cabinets, but we liked the flat style for the drawers, where protruding pulls can be annoying. We’re not disappointed. We settled on brushed brass cabinet hardware—after ordering three different styles. One of our favorite aspects of the kitchen is a graphic tile with dark grouting for the backsplash. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stef made a booklet with Pantone numbers for matching paint, tile, and accessories. We pulled our kitchen colors to other rooms, adding accents in green and yellow.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even though we hadn&#8217;t lived in the apartment yet, we thought hard about how we’d use every space. Their contractor took some square footage from the kitchen to widen the hallway making room for a long built-in bookshelf. </span><span class="s1">For storage in both bedrooms, separate closets were merged together as a single built-in with full-height doors and shelving.</span></p>
<p>To reach optimal electrical aspirations, layouts and furniture placement were carefully planned for overhead lighting installations in the bedrooms and living rooms. Phone chargers were also built into kitchen drawers and outlets were tucked away for electric toothbrushes and hairdryers in the bathroom.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42001 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-During-02.jpg" alt="bathroom during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-During-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-During-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-During-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We rolled with the geometrics, doing graphic tile in the bathroom, too, and pairing it with less expensive, easier-to-clean porcelain. (It’s no joke when your general contractor says everything must be in stock when purchased. After we were promised timely shipping on the bathroom wall tiles by a retailer, the day came and they weren’t there; I spent a stressful morning trying to find something similar.) The tile contrasts nicely with the simple brass fixtures and wood vanity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the expertise of our construction and design teams, our goals came together in a vibrant space. Our contractor met with us weekly—or more—to check on progress and we felt supported knowing we could turn to Sweeten if something went wrong. Jesse and I asked our contractor to copy us both on communications, which worked for us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Seeing our space transform and our vision come to life was so thrilling. We love our kitchen and take such pleasure in cooking and entertaining in it. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you, Jessica and Jesse, for sharing your new home with us!</i></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">What did Miguel do when he moved into a boring white box he called home? He took creative control—the apartment, too had unexpected design finds!</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26634 mb-0 size-chrono" title="homeowner Miguel" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg" alt="custom closets" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After living in the gritty and creative city of Berlin for several years, Miguel, a native New Yorker who works in the music industry, decided to move home. He searched for about nine months for an apartment with character, but in the end, settled for a one-bedroom in a 1950s co-op that he described as bland, cookie cutter, and a white box. At least the location was good—by the water in Cobble Hill. He <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11725" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his profile</a> and turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten contractor</a> banking on transforming the 700-square-foot apartment—this is his third renovation—into a unique home with custom closets. What he didn’t bet on was uncovering beautiful details the apartment had all along.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: Did you renovate your apartment soon after the purchase or were you living in the space for a while?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> I had it for about nine months. I lived on a mattress on the floor because I just moved back from ten years in Berlin, so I was really starting from scratch. Part of living in the apartment beforehand was to figure out what to do with it. You need to live in the space so you can see how it is going to function in different seasons.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26637 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="custom closets" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26639 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="custom closets" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-06-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: Where is the apartment and when was it built? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> It is by the water in Cobble Hill. The neighborhood is tree-lined and historically protected. The apartment is about 700 square feet and in a 1950s co-op. It looked like a cardboard box. It had absolutely no character, so one of the hardest things was to incorporate character. It was boxy with a kitchen, living room, and bedroom with no flow between the rooms. I opened up another part of the wall between the living room and bedroom, like a doorway, and now light from the bedroom window can spill out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> <strong>Did you know about the ceiling beams and exposed brick wall before you started the renovation?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> They were not planned at all. My contractor was fixing some electrical stuff and we found this beautiful brick wall behind there and then we found the beams. The beams and the brick walls were a game-changer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> <strong>How did you incorporate them into the renovation?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> The brick wall in the living room was not so pretty so I <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painted</a> it all white, but left the bedroom original. In this way, the texture continues from the living room to the bedroom in two different colors. The ceilings were not very high so I wanted to paint the beams. There was a lot of discussion with my Sweeten contractor about that. He didn’t want me to paint the beams, but we did in the end. It comes down to a personal taste thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26641 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg" alt="custom closets" width="723" height="482" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26642 size-chrono" title="main living area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="custom closets" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: What did you do with the floors? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> The floors were the original thin pine floorboards, but there was almost nothing underneath so they creaked. We put in a layer of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproofing</a> with an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">engineered wood floor</a> on top. The heat gets pretty hot here in NYC and wood expands and contracts which engineered wood handles better than solid wood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: Was there anything else you did to add character?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> We added crown molding. The walls were literally just sheet rock and the window. Adding crown molding made the windows look bigger and gave them texture. Now, it is almost like a picture frame.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> <strong>What did you do about storage?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> I got rid of a wall of storage closets as you walk in. I made up for it by <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building</a> two small, custom closets on either side of the entrance. This also created a small “entryway” which was missing, but I still needed more storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Around the same time, I had also wanted a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">door</a> for the new opening between the bedroom and living room. I thought about a glass door, but that didn’t feel right. I contacted a local millworker in Brooklyn and asked if a wardrobe could be put on rollers. They said the railings that it would roll on needed to be tight against the wall to stop it from toppling. It is kinda amazing. You never know if it is going to work out right, but it worked out perfectly. So now I have a way to close off the room AND a place to store my clothes and shoes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: The kitchen counter has a nice mix of materials. How did that come about? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> Another challenge was trying to find a dining table. I didn’t have room for one, but I had room for a kitchen counter. I decided to make a table out of a slab of walnut with hairpin steel legs as an extension of the counter. When guests come over, I can move it anywhere in the apartment as a standalone table. It also adds a nice segue to the living room. Above the other counter and range, I decided to keep open shelving. It makes the kitchen feel big as opposed to having a wall of cabinets.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How did your Sweeten help you? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> My contractor was really smooth. I loved that he was fair. There are always going to be mistakes on the contractor&#8217;s end and on mine. I changed my mind a bunch of times—sometimes things in my head didn’t translate into reality. He was really patient with me and open to my crazy ideas.<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

First on the list: remedying a series of separate and awkward bedroom closets—one of which was within another closet (!). They sketched a walk-in closet and dressing room with better flow, re-stained their floors to a modern finish, and combined their belongings from their previous places, all with the wedding date fast approaching. They reached out to Sweeten, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and by project end, they loved the results so much, they extended the job and added to their scope.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Guest blog post by Whitney in Forest Hills, Queens</i></p>
<p>We looked at so many apartments. We stopped counting at 50. We felt discouraged after being outbid on two other apartments by all-cash buyers. But we kept coming back to this apartment. It was different than the others. It was spacious and the wide-open views, natural light, and Southern exposure were alluring. We were willing to overlook the years of wear because it had potential. Ultimately, we were seduced by the view of the Manhattan skyline. Having both lived in NYC studios for over 15 years, Laurence in Sunnyside and me on the Upper East Side, the large bedroom was certainly a plus, but the awkward closet layout was cumbersome.</p>
<p>There was a typical small closet with a simple rod and shelf configuration that had a bi-fold door that could only be opened if the bedroom door was in the closed position. A four-door, full-height mirrored built-in unit concealed the door to the small walk-in closet. In effect, there were four separate closets none of which were completely accessible to the other.</p>

<p>This clumsy arrangement did not work for our lifestyle. We have different work schedules—I&#8217;m an interior designer, Laurence is a bartender in Manhattan—and are respectful not to disturb each other in the early morning or late evening. Knocking down the quirky closets to re-create one large dressing room was the best solution.</p>
<p>Careful planning and meticulous measurements of this new space still allowed for two large chests of drawers and a king-size bed in the bedroom without compromise. Our feng shui consultant advised us on our furniture plan, design and artwork placement to bring positive change, harmony and balance into our home. This was our first home together as a married couple and we wanted to honor it with good vibes. Sketched out on paper, we designed a master bedroom that felt grand and spacious. We wanted to get started right away since we had recently combined households, were living in a studio, paying for two overflowing storage units, carrying two mortgages and maintenance bills, and getting married within the month.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Even though I&#8217;m in the design industry, my go-to contacts were booked. I decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5030" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post my project</a> on Sweeten, and was lucky to find <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a> who had the level of workmanship that met my high standards. He was courteous, professional and punctual. On our first meeting, he was in the lobby waiting for our arrival. With our plan and vision, he was right in step as we discussed what was possible within our budget. Reading Sweeten&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovation cost guideline</a> helped us know what to expect and how to budget for the project.</span></p>

<p>In addition to the dressing room, our wish list included refinishing the floors, replacing the baseboard, and painting. We love the basketweave effect of the original parquet floors, but preferred dark wood floors to feel grounded on the 14th floor. Our contractor&#8217;s positive attitude brought forward creative solutions for our scope of work. While it was cost efficient to preserve the floors, he explained that they were very thin and refinishing them was a risky job. Willing to take the risk, we gave him a color wood sample to match.</p>
<p>After demolition, it was evident that some of the flooring could not be salvaged. The exact same parquet floor was sourced to replace areas in the dressing room and elsewhere in the apartment and looks seamless. He also removed a layer of linoleum in the foyer which revealed the original parquet so now the floor runs throughout, making it feel expansive.</p>
<p>Great progress was made in a short amount of time before we left for our honeymoon, and not wanting to break the momentum, our contractor sent us a text shortly on the first morning after we departed for Amagansett. (We appreciated how he staying in communication with us!) The flooring subcontractor had just mixed three custom stain samples on the floor, and they needed an answer immediately. Luckily, one of the samples was spot on, and they went straight to work. Then we received a call the next day to let us know that the floors did not come out to his satisfaction. He was going to redo them at no additional cost to us, but reiterated his concern in sanding the floors again.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22590 size-chrono" title="closet renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>We returned from our honeymoon and to our delight the floors were gorgeous! We were so happy with the walk-in closet that we asked our contractor to transform the linen and coat closets, too. He was great, the initial job came in on budget, and he advised us of the cost of change orders, billing us appropriately for the additional work we requested along the way so there were no financial surprises in the end.</p>
<p>The investment we made in the apartment and the value-added renovation has enhanced our lifestyle. If space is a luxury, a dressing room is the ultimate luxury.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2005, a condo conversion gave Felix the opportunity to buy an apartment in the Williamsburg building where she had rented for three years. Although she considered renovating the spacious but “grim” rental-grade bathroom at the time, she procrastinated…for over a decade. It wasn’t until 2016 that she pulled the trigger, but the results were well worth the wait. With a bright new master bathroom, a brand new extra powder room, a washer/dryer closet, and an entryway closet, the project incorporated clean lines and Scandinavian-inspired design throughout the new spaces that blended seamlessly with the loft-style apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21113 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-21076"></span>Fun fact: before moving into her current space, Felix lived in an identical apartment two stories above. She was one of the few residents who remained through the conversion, and as the 12-unit building emptied out, the sponsors told her that she could look around and have her pick of the lot. Felix chose to purchase on the third floor with the future in mind: although she didn’t yet have kids, she was hoping to, and a fifth-floor walkup with a baby sounded unrealistic. Given the nearly-empty building, she was also in the unique position of being able to slowly move all her belongings from one apartment to the other, placing her furniture in the exact same location—just two floors down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In early 2015, Felix started thinking renovations again. She now had a daughter, Nova, and while the 1,500-square foot apartment provided plenty of space for the duo, the bathroom update was long overdue, and storage space in the entryway was lacking, so a new closet was also in order. A powder room would be a much-appreciated addition, given that they had room for guests and a third bedroom might be added down the line. Last—but certainly not least—Felix wanted to include a washer/dryer to the scope of her project. When a Google search led her to Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she posted her project</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you might be wondering why a whole year lapsed between Felix posting the project, and the project breaking ground. This is a story of perseverance paying off: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Alan</a>, who Felix chose from several Sweeten matches, patiently checked in with Felix over the course of the next dozen months as she updated and changed the details of the renovation. “We were laughing about it, because it was really just shy of a year of us meeting [for the first time] and me pulling the trigger,” Felix recalled. “That was really why I went with him—he stuck with me through the procrastination!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21094 mb-24 size-large" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-05-600x899.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-05" width="600" height="899" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21092 size-large" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-02-600x899.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-02" width="600" height="899" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once Felix signed on the dotted line, things picked up pace. Alan was helpful in the planning stages by assisting her in decision-making about layout, materials, and finishes. She would send him links and he gave feedback about whether a choice might work. Felix and Alan also worked together to carve up what once was open, under-utilized space right outside of the original bathroom. They physically mapped out where walls would go for the new half-bath and closets, and worked with the building&#8217;s condo board and architect to review the plans and work through permit filing requirements. <span id="m_4274900948712308356gmail-m_-4912132230132608472m_-173239267599755632m_3764308559695335903m_-8103665152874927754m_-6452857499375953401m_-3861732466284412182gmail-m_1969148704937432351m_7319843981009065494gmail-m_-8045206210142907377gmail-docs-internal-guid-4a6a0646-b1cd-4c67-2385-bb691e742e01" class="gmail_msg"></span>Inside the existing full bath, they decided to keep both the sink and the toilet in the original location, but moved the tub slightly to make room for an extra linen closet behind the bathroom door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21114 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-01" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21115 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-02" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21116 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-03" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21117 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21124" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sweeten-Felix-linen-closet.gif" alt="Sweeten-Felix-linen-closet" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sweeten-Felix-linen-closet.gif 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sweeten-Felix-linen-closet-200x300.gif 200w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Felix’s original vision of a “Scandinavian feel” was brought to life through gray and white finishes with wood and colorful accents. In the full bath, Felix chose a gray slate tile for the floor, to contrast against the white bathtub, toilet, and vanity. For the walls, she chose a matte white subway tile from Nemo Tile, intending to lay it horizontally, but changed direction when she realized that the tile fit perfectly along the tub when laid vertically. A glass partition maintains the overall minimalist look. Alan’s team recessed a large mirrored medicine cabinet into the wall, providing ample storage. Felix also appreciated that the understated palette of the permanent fixtures meant that she could change out bright hooks and towels without having to worry about clashing colors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the powder room, Felix carried through the same minimal design and materials, with wall-mounted fixtures that maximize floor space. Although the decision to wall-mount the toilet complemented the overall design, it was borne of necessity: during demo, Alan discovered that a steel beam ran through the floor where the toilet would have stood, making it impossible to run the necessary plumbing. He made use of his extensive network and had a different model delivered with minimal delay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21091 mb-24 size-large" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-01-600x401.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="401" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21119 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-08-723x1100.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-08" width="723" height="1100" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21120 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-09" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21128 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-10-12.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-10-12" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-10-12.gif 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-10-12-200x300.gif 200w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21129" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sweeten-Felix-closet1.gif" alt="Sweeten-Felix-closet1" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sweeten-Felix-closet1.gif 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sweeten-Felix-closet1-200x300.gif 200w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The steel beam beneath the powder room was the only major obstacle in a process that otherwise went smoothly and quickly, with Felix and Nova displaced from their apartment for just under two months. Alan’s team cordoned off the renovation zone to keep dust from invading the rest of the apartment (see <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/8-ways-minimize-mess-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a> on how to minimize mess during construction), and kept it tidy throughout the duration of the project. While construction was underway, Felix would stop by the work site daily to check in and to answer any questions the team had. “But pretty much Alan knew what I wanted,” Felix explained. (This may have had something to do with the fact that they had been talking about this project for 12 months!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Felix and Nova have moved back into the loft, they are thoroughly enjoying the updates. In particular, the stacked washer/dryer has been a “life changer,” and they now have space for coats as well as odds and ends like the vacuum cleaner in the new entryway closet. The baths provide a spa-like experience with plentiful storage, but remain beautifully simple. Felix loves her new space but does have a minor regret—she wishes that she had had the foresight to hang the medicine cabinet in the full bath a bit higher so that she could open the doors without knocking over bottles sitting on the back ledge of the sink. Overall, however, Felix found the renovation process to be “surprisingly easy,” even for a first-time renovator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to Felix and Nova for sharing their space—we’re so glad you decided to go for it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Closet and platform bed storage highlight an alcove studio</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we published Lauren&#8217;s studio renovation in October of 2016, we found ourselves obsessed with everything in it, from the thoughtful design to the clever storage sprinkled throughout. And we weren&#8217;t the only ones. <em>The New York Times</em> covered Lauren&#8217;s home shortly after, (see below) featuring her space in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/getting-organized-in-a-tiny-apartment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Organized in a Tiny Apartment</a>, an article focused on living small—yet smart—in the big city. Since many of you have set the goal of getting organized once and for all, we thought it was time for another look at this inspiring home.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29653 size-chrono" title="Lauren's feature in The New York Times" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-723x781.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="723" height="781" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-723x781.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-278x300.jpg 278w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-600x648.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>With a year left on her lease, timing was not an issue when Lauren closed on her new studio co-op in impossibly charming Brooklyn Heights. But with a desk where a master closet could be and a teeny closet where a chic workspace could be, Lauren needed some help to renovate before settling in. Read on for this first-time homeowner’s take on kitchen, bathroom, closet, and flooring updates throughout her lovely home.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Guest post by Lauren, Brooklyn Heights homeowner</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I started looking for an apartment last fall, I had no idea what to expect. I had narrowed my ideal location to Brooklyn Heights for its proximity to Manhattan and quaint feel. Once I saw the listing for this co-op apartment online, I knew it ticked all of my boxes and was ecstatic when my offer was accepted. I had time on my side as I still had about a year left on my current lease (did not think the buying process would happen as quickly as it did) and I decided the apartment could use some updates to fit my style and taste a bit more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The space gets a lot of light and has a great view of the East River. I wanted to update the bathroom, darken the floors, and optimize storage space in the apartment. The way the previous owner had utilized storage space did not make sense to me; there was a large home office in a closet in the main living space and a small closet in the bed loft area. The bed loft also had a trap door for storage that was only accessible under the bed. I had no idea where to start looking for a contractor, but I remembered reading about an apartment renovation with Sweeten on <em>Apartment Therapy</em>. On a whim, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I posted my project</a>, and I waited to see what sort of responses I would get.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted the apartment to have a clean, fresh, modern, and calm feel with optimized storage to reduce clutter. I had most of my finishes and materials selected before starting the renovation, which made everything that much easier. I got two matches initially and then worked with Sweeten to line up more so I had more bids to compare. I met with four contractors and after much deliberation, I decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The one I chose completely understood my vision and desired style for the apartment. I asked him at one of our first meetings if there was anything that I hadn’t included in the scope of the renovation that I should have, and he immediately mentioned <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating</a> the walls and ceilings. The thought had never crossed my mind, but he pointed out the bowed beams on the ceiling and uneven surface on the walls. He educated me on why it was the best route to make this impactful update.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the start, I knew that it would be difficult to darken the maple floors. Maple is a notoriously difficult wood to introduce stain, and I could tell from a preliminary search on Google just how hard it would be to accomplish. My contractor and his team did not back down from this challenge. They tried to go the normal route of staining first, and after the first round of testing and samples, we knew this would not give the desired result. They investigated different dyes and proper techniques for mixing the dyes and application. After some trial and error (and lots of labor), the floors turned out great!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To match my floors, my contractor re-built the bed loft platform out of the same maple flooring (as it was previously just plywood). He integrated a better storage solution under the bed loft, creating three bays to store off-season clothes and a folding table and chairs for extra guests. He also installed <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoe molding and base molding</a> throughout. In the bed loft area, after removing an existing closet, he created a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/home-office-desk-nooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in desk nook</a>.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29635 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, the existing stove was quite small at 24” and I really like to cook and wanted a standard size range. Replacing the range proved difficult as the existing cabinetry configuration did not allow for a range with 30” of width. With some creativity, my contractor came up with the solution by notching out the cabinets by a half inch on either side, shifting one cabinet down, and making it into a cookbook shelf at my request. This allowed me to get a full-size Samsung 30” gas range.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29636 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29637 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Replacing the range also meant replacing the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a>. I knew I wanted to change the existing dark marble countertops for a light-colored quartz option. I discovered that Pental Quartz Thassos was the brightest white quartz to complement the white gloss Ikea cabinets that I was leaving in place. The same material was used to make new windowsills as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen was also updated with a new sink, faucet, dishwasher, refrigerator, marble backsplash, and new under-cabinet lighting. My contractor came up with another great idea to add a soffit on top of the kitchen cabinets to finish off the look. The kitchen lighting was replaced, swapping out three pendants for one large lantern pendant.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the fact that the bathtub was too short for its location really bugged me. There also was a very odd triangular corner which I thought was a terrible waste of space. Working with my contractor, I am so pleased with how the bathroom turned out. It feels like a mini spa. He squared off the triangular corner and broke through the wall to the exterior hallway, making the triangular corner into a linen closet that&#8217;s accessible right outside the bathroom. I added a drop-in tub that fits the space better and opened it up by replacing the shower curtain with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass shower panel</a>. The tinted shower tile gives the otherwise all-white bathroom a refreshing pop of color. New shower lighting highlights the unique color of the tile. The fixtures are from Kohler, as is the vanity.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN-Lauren-DeCaro-Closet.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29646 mb-0 size-full" title="closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN-Lauren-DeCaro-Closet.gif" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="816" height="1224" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My contractor came up with a great idea for closets and went with larger 8-foot closet doors to make the space feel more expansive and draw your eye up to the beams. We replaced all the doors with single panel doors and simple chrome hardware. Two closets were customized by California Closets while the contractor and his team built shelving in the other two closets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They also built a cover for the AC/heat unit in the living room, with the front panel mimicking the same style as the bathroom sink vanity. And he even took the time to come back to the apartment to mount the TV properly when a handyman I’d hired had an issue mounting it into a steel stud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a first-time renovator, Sweeten made the process pretty painless. My contractor takes great pride in his work, and as a client, I could not be happier with my experience working with him. Yes, there were delays (as there always are), but he was incredibly communicative and was able to handle my nerves and constant questions. He and his team are perfectionists and true craftsmen, and I could not be more pleased with their work. Everyone who comes to see the apartment sees the quality of how the tile is laid in the bathroom to how the floors are re-done, and I owe it all to my Sweeten contractor.</p>
