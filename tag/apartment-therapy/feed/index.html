<span class="img-label">Guest post by Lisa, Upper East Side homeowner</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last year, after renting in the Village for 20 years, I bought a small one-bedroom on the Upper East Side. The apartment is on a high floor, bright and sunny, and except for the kitchen, in perfect condition. The teeny tiny kitchen was dated and shabby with sagging cabinets, cracked tile, bulky appliances, and a huge mystery stain on the ugly laminate countertop<span id="more-14621"></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because I had no experience planning a renovation, I decided to live with the kitchen and figure out exactly what worked and what didn’t. As soon as I unpacked, one problem became apparent… the builder-grade cabinets were too shallow for serving dishes and cookware and I had to store my pots and pans in my coat closet. The lower drawers and cabinets were so narrow they were almost useless. The kitchen sink was far too shallow and there was limited counter space with only one electrical outlet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14626" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-05" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-05-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-05-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14624" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-03" width="600" height="803" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-03-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With these issues in mind, I started my research.  My dream kitchen had beautiful wooden cabinetry with sleek appliances and marble counters, but as I evaluated the actual space I had to work with (and my budget), I decided that a clean minimal style would work best in the boxy little space. Once I figured out what I was looking for, I started canvassing my friends for contractor recommendations. The horror stories scared me enough to postpone my plans for a month or so, until one by one, my appliances started dying. The stove burners led the way, followed in rapid succession by the microwave and dishwasher. When the refrigerator started making a grinding noise, I knew I couldn’t procrastinate any longer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fortunately, I read about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> on Apartment Therapy and it sounded like exactly what I needed. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I posted my project</a> and quickly got an email from Sweeten helping me determine that because I knew pretty much what I was looking for and wasn’t making drastic structural changes, I could reasonably go with a good contractor and forgo hiring (and paying for) a designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I got in touch with four contractors referred by Sweeten and ultimately selected <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Erion</a>. He wasn’t discouraged by the size of the kitchen, understood what I was looking for, had great taste, and showed an eye for details. As a newbie, I also really appreciated that he was very clear about costs, estimating to me what materials and labor were expected to cost for each item instead of just giving me a lump price.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14627" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14632" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-06" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-06-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14629" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I sent Erion photos of minimalist-style kitchens I liked and gave him my list of complaints about the current kitchen. From that point on, he took over. He handled everything. He recommended that we go with semi-custom cabinets in order to get the depth I wanted, and showed me samples for countertops and hardware, first editing options down to two or three initial choices, with more available if necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on Erion’s samples, I went with white high-gloss upper cabinets and gray high-gloss lower cabinets with bar pull hardware. The countertop is <a href="https://www.daltile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daltile’s One Quartz</a> in Luminesce, which is a bright white that went nicely with the cabinets and backsplash and needs almost no upkeep. For the backsplash, I went with <a href="https://www.marazziusa.com/our-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marazzi Sistem C</a> Bianco, similar to subway tile but with an interesting size. In order to add a little visual interest, we used three rows of Daltile Fashion Accents in nickel blend. The floor is tiled in Marazzi Soho Anthracite because, well, just because I love the look of a slate floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to maximize the little space I have, I chose a <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/products/dishwashers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch 18-inch dishwasher</a> and a <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel 25-inch counter-depth refrigerator</a>. The range and microwave are both <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a>, chosen mostly for the sleek lines and reliable reputation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The end result is both beautiful and functional, and was on time and on budget!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna moved into their two-bedroom home &#8212; a former kindergarten classroom in a converted South Slope / Greenwood Heights Catholic school &#8212; four years ago. High ceilings, check. Big windows, check. Modern urban oasis, check. Erica, who works for the City of New York, and Donna, a digital product consultant, were initially drawn to industrial and rustic decor as a way to balance and warm up the contemporary feel of their new space. But, after overspending on a pricey couch and accenting the windows and doors with a red paint that grew to irritate them both, the couple decided they needed design help. After they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a>, we introduced them to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/814" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten designer</a> to help bring new life to this old-school space.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="small-bedroom-with-hardwood-before-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47989 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3.jpg" alt="small bedroom with hardwood floor before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="bedroom-with-teal-accent-wall" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47984 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2.jpg" alt="small bedroom with teal accent wall and wall lights and hardwood floors and windows after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Our designer had a lot of creative ideas. Some of the areas of our apartment that she transformed were not even on our radar design-wise until she pointed them out.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Erica W., Brooklyn Homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna focused first on their bedroom. They wanted tranquility, comfort, and a little romance; they also needed to maximize the long, narrow layout of the room and find art to make the space feel personal and vibrant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The designer sought to create a relaxed retreat, in tune with the couple&#8217;s design preferences. She put together an inspiration booklet to illustrate creative concepts, drawings, and to simply nail the creative vision. The trio took group shopping trips and worked together to upgrade the shabby-schoolhouse-chic vibe with cleaner lines, bolder colors, and improved. Their designer led the way with an accent wall in Benjamin Moore Venezuelan Sea, offset by the existing gray on the remaining walls. Two smart tricks here: first, the accent wall appears to wash onto the overdyed rug, lengthening <wbr />the space in a way that makes the furniture selections look custom and built-in, and second, the accent wall provides an immediate visual shift, just by painting a single wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="bedroom-with-teal-accent-wall" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47983 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1.jpg" alt="bedroom with teal accent wall and adjustable long reach wall mounted lights after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna love the gray tufted Cisco Brothers bed &#8211; it anchors the room and offers geometric depth to the monochromatic bedding (full disclosure: I am <a href="https://sweeten.com/team/apartment-renovation-east-village/">partial to gray tufted upholstery</a>!). The designer found a gorgeous and super-functional armed lighting fixture on <a href="https://classifieds.apartmenttherapy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apartment Therapy Classifieds</a> to feature above the bed &#8211; a hat tip to Erica and Donna&#8217;s fondness for industrial pieces but with a decidedly glam finish. Mounting the lighting fixture on the wall above the bed freed up space on each bedside table, crucial in a room with just eight feet in width to spare. If you look closely, you can catch a side glimpse of Marilyn Monroe swimming in the photo on the left wall. Erica especially loves this piece and the shot of red and green it offers up to complement other accents in the room.</p>
<h2>&#8220;I sought to create a refreshingly relaxed retreat. The solution was to carry varying hues of blue and green heavily-pigmented accent walls &#8211; the colors of the sea &#8211; throughout the space. Serene, but invigorating.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>&#8211; </em>Sweeten Designer</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the open living room, their designer set out to rehab the &#8220;expensive mistakes&#8221; that frustrated Erica and Donna. They focused on highly saturated paint colors and new, more comfortable furniture. The windows are such a central feature to the space; the designer restored their presence with Benjamin Moore Super White throughout the room and cleared away stuff that had accumulated on the unusually deep window sills. They also selected a central wall to saturate with yellow, anchoring the space. To further play up the industrial loft theme, a structural beam and elements of the sprinkler system were coated in a dark bronze.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna swapped out their dining set for Eames molded chairs. The dining table, already part of their collection, reflects the couple&#8217;s love for reclaimed materials, but looks updated with the clean lines of the new chairs. The Milo Baughman coffee table is simple and uncluttered; the Saarinen side table plays up the clean and modern furniture touches &#8211; both were savvy finds on eBay.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Toward the kitchen, visitors get their first glimpse of an accent wall coated in Benjamin Moore Juniper. As a standalone feature, it&#8217;s a fun addition to the yellow and white throughout the room. But, it also serves as a sneak peak into the new bedroom and ties the spaces together visually. Erica and Donna revived the old kitchen cabinets, originally finished with a faux cherry wood stain, by painting them with Farrow &amp; Ball&#8217;s Light Blue. I love this color &#8211; it is equal parts vintage and modern, simple but playful.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Behind the kitchen, Erica and Donna invested in creating a new closet space to help them keep stuff organized and out of sight. Working from the design, this Sweeten contractor built shelving and enclosed the closet with sliding doors and simple hardware.</p>

Brooklyn Heights homeowner, Lisa worked with tS member NYC Pros on her budget-friendly renovation; we stopped in to see the progress &amp; take photos along the way, but the rest of this story is told by Lisa herself. This week we&#8217;ll look at the processes behind planning &amp; renovating, and next week we&#8217;ll look at the project budget and final results of Lisa&#8217;s fully-updated, eat-in kitchen. </i><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="lisa-posing-in-her-kitchen"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48012 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost.jpg" alt="lisa posing in her kitchen with white cabinets and gray backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I first moved into my apartment a year ago, I knew I wanted to renovate the kitchen.  I wouldn’t say the place is a fixer upper, but the kitchen was dated – the appliances were all too small, the backsplash was an awful, murky green tile, and the cabinets were too high and just did not provide enough efficient storage.  There was also a big hole in the wall right underneath the sink that I totally missed prior to moving in. With the costs of buying my first home, renovating wasn’t something I could take on immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This summer, however, my fiancé is moving in. So, after a year of living with a less than optimal kitchen, I did a bit of financial planning and I decided to bite the bullet and take the leap to do a renovation-on-a-budget.<span id="more-9349"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-cabinets-black-floor-before-renovation"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48016 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-Before.jpg" alt="small kitchen with white cabinets and square backsplash tiles and black floor before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-Before.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-Before-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-Before-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Planning Process </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I started planning in early April, starting with where I would purchase my kitchen (easy, Ikea), whether I would replace my appliances (initially no, but then decided it would be better from a resale perspective to have “larger” appliances), and how I would find a contractor (um, who knew?).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kitchen Cabinets</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I planned a day out to Brooklyn Ikea with my fiancé, sister, and friend, mostly for moral support, but also because who doesn’t like to spend a day hanging out in Ikea?  I had at that point pored through the catalogue and had a general idea of what I wanted, which ended up being what I chose: <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AKURUM in Lidi White</a>. While at Ikea, I learned more about the planning services they offer, and I was happy to pay $99 for someone to come over and measure my kitchen and upload the specifications into the Ikea Kitchen Planner (more on how this worked out below) before I started playing pretend architect and interior designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Appliances</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I decided to replace my 20 inch range with a 24 inch range, my small white refrigerator with a shiny new LG “skinny” fridge, keep my 17 inch wide dishwasher because I had never actually used it, and install a range hood (even though it wouldn’t vent outside, I thought it must help somewhat to circulate the air above the cooktop).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Contractors</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I spoke with 5 contractors, each of whom I found via a different source.  The first was through Ikea’s primary contractor, which was the company that came to measure my kitchen.  The second, I found while trolling through ikeafans.com.  The third was an independent contractor, introduced to me through a friend.  The fourth was a contact of my mother’s.  The last was through a submission to Sweeten, which I had read about in a blog post on Apartment Therapy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, I made the decision to go with #5, Peter Ramirez of NYC Pros, who I was matched to by theSweeten.  Peter was professional, thorough, and committed to staying within our agreed upon budget.  He even sat down with me prior to my big purchase at Ikea just to make sure I didn’t miss minor things like toe kicks and hinges and the like.  As we all know, going to Ikea for small items is a big pain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Countertops, Flooring and Backsplash</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I also ended up going through Peter’s contact for my countertops. It was something I had not originally planned for, but I am glad I decided to go with quartz as opposed to the laminate that Ikea sells. It took me two trips to Williamsburg and a comparison trip to Home Depot, but I now have amazing gray stone countertops that really lift the whole look and feel of the kitchen, I love it. My backsplash and floor tiles were a simple purchase made on homedepot.com, since I already had an idea of what I wanted – gray stone-like laminate tiles and a clear glass backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="demolished-kitchen-during-renovation"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48014 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-1.jpg" alt="demolished kitchen with only sink remaining during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Renovation Process</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All I have to say is that your choice in contractor drives your overall experience, because you must trust that things will get done according to your expectations from a quality and time-frame perspective. We started the renovation on May 7<sup>th</sup>, a day after I had originally planned, because yours truly took longer to get all the paperwork submitted to the coop board than expected.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Day 1 was demolition and putting in the new floors.</li>
<li>Day 2 was repairing the (gross) walls post demolition.</li>
<li>Days 3 and 4 were installing the base cabinets, which required cutting into wall.  Regardless of the exact measurements and careful layout on the Ikea Kitchen Planner, one lesson learned is that in reality, not everything will fit perfectly.  End of the weekend brought the countertop templating as well.</li>
</ul>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Day 5 was wall cabinet installation.</li>
<li>Day 6 was installing appliances.</li>
<li>Day 7 was plaster and painting.  Day 7 was also supposed to be countertop installation day but our guy ended up with a burst eye artery!  So off to the hospital and for some much needed rest he went.</li>
<li>Day 8 became new countertop day, with some backsplash installation.</li>
<li>Day 9 wrapped up the backsplash and cleanup. Yes, the total renovation was only 9 days! I suppose when you have a small kitchen, it is totally doable.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, my fiancé and I were in and out of the apartment about once every other day, just to check out the progress and to make some executive decisions, like how high the backsplash was going to extend.  I feel like I got really lucky with the entire renovation. Not only was everything done on time, which I have heard almost never happens, but it was really pretty painless. In fact, by the time Peter and his team left, it was somewhat bittersweet, I was all done!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">“It&#8217;s an amazing feeling to walk into our apartment and feel like it&#8217;s our &#8216;home&#8217; &#8212; and we owe much of that to Peter and his team.”</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">–Marie Clare K., Homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Park Slopers Marie Clare &amp; Peter purchased their first home together early this year, the couple, along with their daughter Tessa, knew the space would need some improvements in order to make it the perfect retreat for their active lifestyle. Marie Clare, a copywriter for Bobbi Brown, and Peter, who works for Mayor Bloomberg, planned to modernize the 2 bedroom home, focusing on the living space &amp; bathroom. With a great sense of style and a clear, modern vision, they posted their project ideas to Sweeten, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and chose a Sweeten general contractor for the renovation. Firm owner Peter Ramirez impressed the new homeowners by completing the project in only 3 weeks to meet their March 30th move-in &#8212; and the results are as charming as little Tessa!</p>

The homeowners wanted to create a brighter and more open space, starting with the removal of a large archway that separated the living and dining spaces.</p></div>

Marie Clare &amp; Peter are long-time subscribers to shelter blogs &amp; magazines &#8212; and their enthusiasm shows through their curated material selections and collection of furniture, lighting &amp; decorative accessories. We love the ceiling fixtures they chose for the dining and living spaces: a white/wood <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turning Pendant by West Elm</a> and an <a href="https://www.lumens.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artemis Fan by Minka Aire</a>.</p></div>

She says that the double-wide chair is perfect for taking in the beautiful view of the treetops outside her living room windows.

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">“Peter Ramirez of NYC Pros delivered on every single one of his promises.

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">“[The NYC Pros] team was incredibly professional and they worked double-time to make sure that our apartment would be ready for our move in date; they finished work on a Friday and we moved in the next morning!”</h2>

The floor was done with <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Embarcadero</a> tiles in Market, and <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metro</a> subway tiles in Ultra White are used in the shower; both are by Nemo Tile.</p></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This week we&#8217;re in the home of interior designer Katherine Hammond to check out the newest addition to her lovely Brooklyn Brownstone. After hearing about us from a friend, Katherine posted on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> seeking a contractor to build the <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/built-in-floating-desk-for-home-office-Prospect-Heights-Brooklyn-NY-awarded-to-contractor/510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom floating desk</a> she had designed. We matched her up with Nick Dillon of <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick Knacks Creative Interiors</a>, who worked with the designer to build and install her floating-concept desk. When the project was completed, Katherine reported that Nick was a &#8216;dream to work with&#8217; &#8211;and, as a bonus to us, she even ended up becoming a member of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> network with her company <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine Hammond Interiors</a>!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6011 size-full mb-24" title="01_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/01_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="418" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/01_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/01_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> </a>Here&#8217;s a shot of the space when <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/built-in-floating-desk-for-home-office-Prospect-Heights-Brooklyn-NY-awarded-to-contractor/510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine posted her project.</p>
<p><span id="more-6009"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6012 mb-24 size-full" title="02_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_theSweeten_floatingdesk-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />And here&#8217;s the transformed space! Katherine&#8217;s desk spans the length of the wall and is built-in for a floating effect, rather than being held up by vertical structural elements. Katherine explained that Nick advised her in the desk&#8217;s structural design, adding 3 thin steel brackets at different intervals across the span of the desk. In the center-back, the desk features a linear opening for cords so that items can be plugged in neatly and also moved from side to side. Beneath the opening, the cords are run through a hollow channel and straight to a power source which was relocated by NKCI for this purpose. These details allow Katherine can keep her desk as cord-free as possible!</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6014 size-full" title="04_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="418" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The desk was designed to be tucked away in the alcove behind this headboard. Like much of this Brooklyn Brownstone interior, the headboard, which doubles as a bookcase on the other side, was designed and built by Katherine and her father. Katherine consulted Francois Chambard of <a href="https://umproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UM Project</a>, an innovative furniture design co., for construction detailing to ensure a minimal look.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6015 mb-24 size-full" title="05_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/05_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/05_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/05_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> When Nick &amp; his crew came to install the desk (which they built off-site), Nick did his usual, <a href="/2012/06/21/site-visit-w-nick-knacks-creative-interiors-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very meticulous prep-work</a> in order to ensure that none of Katherine&#8217;s belongings were damaged.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6016 mb-24 size-full" title="06_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/06_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/06_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/06_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> We love how clean and minimal the design is &#8211;and while we can only see a glimpse of the desk from around the corner, we can still get a sense of its conceptual lightness.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6017 mb-24 size-full" title="07_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Here&#8217;s the designer, Katherine Hammond. Once her desk was in place, Katherine painted a few layers of <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magnetic paint primer</a> onto the wall above. Now her inspirations can also float (without damaging the wall!). Covering the magnetic layer is Benjamin Moore&#8217;s <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/for-painting-contractors/paint-products/satin-impervo-alkyd-low-lustre-paint#advs=0&amp;tab=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Satin Impervo</a>, which was also used on the desk.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6030 mb-24 size-full" title="10_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />We couldn&#8217;t be happier to have found the perfect match for Katherine&#8217;s project! Many thanks to Nick, Dawn &amp; team at Nick Knacks Creative Interiors, and to Katherine of Katherine Hammond Interiors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week we gave you a rundown on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of custom built-in shelving</a>. This week as a follow up, we&#8217;re sharing a book-loving Brooklynite&#8217;s renovation.This project was recently posted to theSweeten and awarded to <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ecostruct</a>; Amanda, the homeowner, was looking to replace her existing galley kitchen with a nook for storing her books. The new design is attractive and affordable, made from <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/">Ikea Lagan</a> countertops and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ClosetMaid-12-Inch-ShelfTrack-Locking-2853/dp/B000FSQ7QS/ref=dp_cp_ob_hg_title_0">Closetmaid</a> track brackets, it was inspired by a  feature in the March issue of <a href="https://www.luckymag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucky Magazine</a>. It&#8217;s such a cool yet simple idea that lots of people took notice, including <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/good-idea-repurposed-countertop-shelving-167858" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apartment Therapy</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.annesage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The City Sage</a>.</p>

<p>Amanda explained,</p>
<h3>&#8220;[theSweeten] took the guesswork out of finding the right person for the job. Jon of Ecostruct was trustworthy, reliable, easy to get ahold of and experienced with the kind of work we needed done. We are thrilled with how the shelves turned out. They look exactly like the inspiration photo we gave Jon, and totally transformed the room.&#8221;</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the whole process:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/00_Before-B.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3659 mb-10" title="00_Before-B" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/00_Before-B.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/00_Before-B.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/00_Before-B-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a><span class="img-label">  The house was originally a three-family dwelling, Amanda combined two of those units and didn&#8217;t need the second kitchen.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.ajmadison.com/cgi-bin/ajmadison/D2000W.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4797749471_292ba6dbae.jpg" alt="COMPACT KITCHEN DANBY" /></a></p>
<p>One of the delights of internet searches is that they often lead you to things you didn&#8217;t even know you cared about.  While researching gas ranges the other day I stumbled across this image of a &#8220;compact kitchen,&#8221; a single, 30&#8243;-wide appliance that contains a range, refrigerator and sink. As an architect I pine for everything to be extraordinarily beautiful and elegant, but there&#8217;s something about the stubborn practicality of these pieces that&#8217;s incredibly appealing. Compact kitchens like this one by <a href="https://www.avantiproducts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avanti</a> have won me over.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.avantiproducts.com/products/cat/50" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4798380536_2860ae553e.jpg" alt="COMPACT KITCHEN AVANTI BLACK" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.avantiproducts.com/products/cat/50" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4797750299_61335e474f.jpg alt=" fridge="" compact="compact" kitchen="" avanti="" white="" open="" /></a></p>
<p>These appliances are commonly installed in offices, RV&#8217;s, dorm and hotel rooms, and basements. But they&#8217;d work beautifully in New York City apartment too, when there&#8217;s not quite enough space for a conventional kitchen. You could just tuck one of these units into the corner of the dining room, at the end of the hall, or in a coat closet.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve been around for quite a while. General Air Conditioning made a compact kitchen in the 1950&#8217;s that was featured in <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apartment Therapy</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/chicago/good-questions/good-questions-modern-allinone-kitchen-060421" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4798381490_d4c07769b2.jpg" alt="COMPACT KITCHEN VINTAGE GE" /></a></p>
<p>In 1964 <a href="https://www.boffi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boffi</a> manufactured a &#8220;Mini Kitchen&#8221; designed by Joe Colombo, and they&#8217;ve since developed an updated model. The original model doesn&#8217;t look like an appliance at all. Encased in stained wood panels, with concealed burners and secret pull-out drawers, it has the geometric purity of cubist sculpture.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4797750619_3381ef93d3.jpg" alt="COMPACT KITCHEN BOFFI 1964" /></p>
<p>The most basic units are modest in appearance and don&#8217;t cost any more than an ordinary gas range would. But there are also larger, more expensive units that are actually quite handsome. Compact Concepts makes a full-height round, rotating unit that comes equipped with a dishwasher and storage cabinets, and that&#8217;s available in different high-fashion finishes. It would look lovely in a raw, open, loft-like space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4797749877_241e7f6711.jpg" alt="COMPACT KITCHEN CLEVERKITCHEN" /></p>
<p>A few years ago architect Zaha Hadid designed two kitchen units, &#8220;Fire&#8221; and &#8220;Water,&#8221; in collaboration with <a href="https://www.dupont.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corian</a> and <a href="https://www.ernestomeda.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ernestomeda</a>. They look more like a spaceship command center than a kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ernestomeda.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4798381136_32cd53df84.jpg alt=" table="" compact="compact" kitchen="" z="" island="" /></a></p>
<p>Dutch designer Sietze Kalwijk had the opposite approach, stripping typical kitchen fixtures and appliances of all their displays, controls, and shells. This compact kitchen provides only the bare essentials: a burner, a sink, a work surface, and hose connections for gas and water.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kalkwijk.com/ximage/pid/144/i/8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4798380674_9da747e894.jpg" alt="COMPACT KITCHEN KYDEX" /></a></p>
<p>Maybe one reason these compact kitchens are so appealing is that they make cooking seem simpler and more fun. While a skilled cook could prepare a gorgeous meal with one, for the rest of us they&#8217;re just wonderful playthings.</p>
