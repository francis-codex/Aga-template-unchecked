<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Have you ever noticed: when you have friends over or are at home with your family, everyone congregates in the kitchen? </span><span class="s1">That’s because the kitchen is truly the heart of a house. Whether your kitchen is a cooking space in an old Boston Victorian or a condo in East Boston, it can be renovated to work with the way you cook. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deciding on a budget is one of your first steps in this journey. In this guide, Sweeten offers a jumping-off point for how much your kitchen renovation will cost. It covers key factors, such as the age of your house, the design you want, and the finishes you want, which all affect your final costs. You&#8217;ll also need to meet with a general contractor, who will want to see the space to confirm an accurate budget. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s what to expect when remodeling a kitchen in Boston, and how much it may cost.</span></p>
<h3>Plumbing in Boston apartment buildings</h3>
<p>One issue that Boston-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6981#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Taghi</a> sees a lot is that the older, smaller pipe size in some buildings doesn’t match the bigger pipe size of modern fixtures. As a result, “Your water pressure will go down,” said Taghi. Often, this is not apparent until a general contractor gets into the walls. If this happens to you, prepare your budget accordingly. Changing the size of those older pipes in the walls can add a few thousand dollars to a kitchen renovation’s budget, Taghi said.</p>
<h3>Old walls in apartments and houses</h3>
<p>Because of age, and a lack of building codes and structural engineering in the years before the 1950s, older buildings can have shoddy workmanship. “This is the most problematic issue &#8211; the lack of consistency in buildings,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/7012#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Jeff</a> who is based in Boston.  One potential outcome is walls that are not plumped or straight. Like the pipes, it is not likely to be clear when a general contractor is pricing out a job. Walls like this often have to be rebuilt and can add to the budget (and a few extra days to the timeline).</p>
<h3>Switching to an open plan living</h3>
<p>A lot of kitchen remodels—apartment <em>or</em> house—in Boston involve pulling down a wall to open the space between kitchen, dining, and living room. Of course, that isn’t how many Boston homes were designed—so it is easier said than done! Frequently, a load-bearing wall has to come down, so the roof or top floor needs to be supported in another way, said Sweeten expert Taghi. Ultimately, it can mean a huge beam needs to be installed across the space to hold everything up.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WAYS TO PREPARE</span>:</h4>
<p>Talk to your general contractor about the possible issues that may come up based on the age and history of your home. It’s always a good plan to have a 10%—15% contingency plan of the final budget in case problems arise.</p>
<h3>Remodeling in a Boston apartment vs. a Boston house</h3>
<p>When outlining your budget, an important factor will be whether you’re in a house or an apartment. Surprisingly, a house renovation often has lower costs than an apartment! Renovating an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/common-renovation-delays-how-to-prepare-for-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apartment will mean stricter rules</a> on times and days your general contractor can be at work, which then adds to the timeline, which <em>then</em> adds to the budget.</p>
<p>In an apartment, the demolition phase can also take longer because whatever you’re removing can’t just be carted out the front door and into a dumpster. It needs to go through common hallways, and down service elevators to get outside. The availability of parking for your general contractor and other tradespeople can also add to the time it takes them each day to get started on the job.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WAYS TO PREPARE</span>:</h4>
<p>Your contractor should be able to discuss a general timeline with the following milestones so you can feel prepared with the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>a start date range</li>
<li>milestones</li>
<li>potential variables</li>
</ul>
<h3>Doing a Boston Kitchen Remodel with Mid-Range Finishes</h3>
<p>A mid-range kitchen remodel in Boston can start at <strong>$40,000</strong>. It involves a layout change, with the addition of a kitchen island. However, it’s important that the location of plumbing and electrical stay as-is to keep costs down.</p>
<p>With this budget, you have a lot more creative leeway with semi-custom wood cabinets. You can consider appliance brands, like General Electric, and can include a vented range hood, a built-in microwave, and garbage disposal. You can also play around with some custom lighting.</p>
<h3>Doing a Boston Kitchen Remodel with Upscale Finishes</h3>
<p>An upscale kitchen remodel in Boston starts at <strong>$65,000.</strong> This budget level means you can look overseas for creative backsplash tiles, delve into quartz (or even marble countertops), and use custom cabinets. Take note: Fully custom cabinets can take a third to half of your budget.</p>
<p>You can browse designer kitchen stores for an undermount sink and designer faucets, plus a water filtration system. (Tip: with an undermount sink, your countertops cascade into the sink for easy wiping.) Lighting design, including undercabinet lighting, is also within your budget’s reach. Flooring can be tile.</p>
<p>Like the mid-range kitchen, you can play around with the layout by adding a kitchen island. But again, it’s advised that you keep your oven and sink where they are. That way, you can save money on plumbing and electrical, and spend more on those European tiles.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Boston </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-boston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-boston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p><span class="s1">From brownstones to grand Victorians and Federals, all the way to modern apartments, Boston has it all, when it comes to homes. There’s a good reason for that. Boston is one of the oldest cities in America—circa 1630—and has cycled through many eras. </span><span class="s1">If you’re planning to remodel your home and want to learn about the various costs to remodel in Boston, then Sweeten should be your first stop. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, </span><span class="s1">a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, offers </span><span class="s1">a general cost guide to get you started on your first step: your budget. However, to get an accurate figure for your project, a contractor will want to see the space in person. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a quick overview of budgets for some typical renovation projects:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Gut renovation: Starting at around <strong>$100</strong> psf (per square foot)<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$15,000</strong>—<strong>$30,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$30,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$65,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Budget bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$15,000</strong>—<strong>$18,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$27,000</strong> or <strong>$770</strong> psf<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end master bathroom remodel and reconfiguration: Starting at <strong>$50,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Basement: Starting at <strong>$25,000</strong><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="s1">How much a Boston remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A total gut renovation in Boston that brings your home down to its frame will likely start at around <strong>$100</strong> psf. Doing it all at once will get you the best price per square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With Boston predominantly older—in some cases very old—housing stock, gut renovations may be higher than elsewhere with newer homes. Depending on the area, your choice in finishes, and the condition of your home or apartment, this could reach $300 psf, according to Boston-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6981#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Taghi</a>. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48197" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Boston-RemodelingCosts-.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="710" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Boston-RemodelingCosts-.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Boston-RemodelingCosts--300x213.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Boston-RemodelingCosts--600x426.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a Boston kitchen remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The typical renovation cost for a minor kitchen in Boston starts at <strong>$15,000</strong> and goes up to <strong>$30,000</strong>.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen: For the Boston area, expect costs to start at <strong>$30,000</strong>. <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s 2020 Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/new-england/boston-ma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">report</span></a> puts the average mid-grade kitchen renovation cost around <strong>$80,000</strong>. This is about <strong>$10,000</strong> above the national average and works out to be <strong>$400</strong> psf. With a budget of this amount, you can remodel a 200-square-foot space with laminate countertops, semi-custom wood cabinets, and a stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet. It also allows the addition of a built-in microwave, dishwasher, and custom lighting. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1">Other than<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3"> adding a kitchen island</span></a>, the layout, such as where the oven and dishwasher were installed, remained the same as the original design. Keeping your floor plan the same will be the biggest factor in keeping your budget down.<br /></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="s1">High-end kitchen: High-end kitchen remodels can start at <b>$65,000</b> while the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/new-england/boston-ma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">report</span></a> places the average around <strong>$155,000</strong> for Boston. The cost per square foot is <strong>$775</strong>. This type of project can add more than half that amount—<strong>$85,000</strong>—to your home’s value. The scope at the budget range can consist of custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported ceramic or glass tile backsplashes. The appliances were also kicked up a few notches to include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood. Designer faucets and a water filtration system were also part of the materials.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cabinets are by far the biggest expense in a kitchen especially when they are custom made. According to Boston-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/7012#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Jeff</a>, one client chose to spend <strong>$35,000</strong> on cabinets—almost half the whole budget—in an <strong>$80,000</strong> renovation of a small kitchen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appliances are also a big factor in the budget if you decide to spend a large percentage here and save in other areas.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a Boston bathroom remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The typical home renovation cost for a budget bathroom in Boston starts at <strong>$15,000</strong> and goes up to <strong>$18,000</strong>.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom: For Boston, the average cost of a mid-grade bathroom remodel is about <strong>$27,000</strong> or <strong>$770</strong> psf, according to the Cost Vs Value <span class="s3">report</span>. This budget could get you a remodeled 35-square-foot bathroom with a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. A renovation of this level can add more than <strong>$16,000</strong> to a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home’s value, recouping close</a> to 60 percent of the project’s cost.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end master bathroom: Renovation costs start at <strong>$50,000</strong> for a high-end master bath in Boston. According to Cost Vs Value,  the average price is around <strong>$82,000</strong> or <strong>$820</strong> psf. You could afford to expand your existing bathroom from 35 square feet to around 100 square feet and play around with elements like a freestanding soaker tub and a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. You’re also likely to afford a double sink and double-mirror vanity with custom draws and wall cabinets.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like all renovations, your budget comes down to your choices, said contractor Jeff. And sometimes those choices will have a ripple effect on the budget. Tiles can range from <strong>$2</strong> psf at Home Depot or <strong>$100</strong> psf for imported tile. The cost and timeline can increase if the tile chosen requires specialized installation such as Italian mosaic tile which one of Jeff’s clients ordered.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much it costs to renovate a basement</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">A basement renovation starts at <strong>$25,000</strong>. The average cost is <strong>$88,000</strong>, the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/new-england/boston-ma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">report</span></a> found. </span><span class="s2">The project for this budget includes a 20′ x 30′ main room and a 5′ x 8′ bathroom with a shower. The main room can contain a bar area as well as laminate flooring and insulation, a largely unseen but important part of the project to combat those wet, frosty winters. This example project works out to <strong>$137</strong> psf. </span><span class="s4"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s right in line with what Sweeten contactor Jeff estimates a basic basement—walls, drainage, and electrical—will cost for homes in the Boston area. The cost increases once you add a bathroom or a bar according to Jeff.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Building permit costs</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the City of Boston, which covers over 200 square miles around the city center, <a href="https://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/isd%20fee%20schedule_tcm3-31721.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">permits</span></a> for a major residential remodel starts at <strong>$50</strong>. This increases by <strong>$10</strong> for every <strong>$1,000</strong> of the budget. There are additional charges for electrical and plumbing work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If your home is in Norfolk County then you will need to check the township your home is located in. The county is made of dozens of small towns and each has its own building permit system. For example, <a href="https://www.dedham-ma.gov/Home/ShowDocument?id=796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">in Dedham</span></a>, a permit for additions, including decks, costs <strong>$10</strong> per <strong>$1,000</strong> of planned work. This would mean a <strong>$30,000</strong> kitchen addition would attract a <strong>$300</strong> permit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over in <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/inspection/buildingelectricplumbingpermits/buildingfees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">Cambridge</span></a>, which is located in Middlesex County, a building permit costs <strong>$15</strong> per <strong>$1,000</strong> in the budget. So a permit for that same <strong>$30,000</strong> kitchen addition would be <strong>$450</strong> in Cambridge.</span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639640020029"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does it cost to remodel a house in Boston?</u></strong> </strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A typical Boston home renovation costs roughly $100 per square foot. To maximize savings, complete the entire project at once, rather than splitting it up over several years. However, with Boston’s historically old housing stock, gut renovation costs may be higher than elsewhere with newer homes. Depending on the area, the choice in finishes, and the condition of the home or apartment, costs may reach $300 psf.</p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">In Boston, budget-level kitchen remodels cost $15,000—$30,000 on average. Mid-grade Boston kitchens can range in cost from $30,000—$80,000, or roughly $400 per square foot.
