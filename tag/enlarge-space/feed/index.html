</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><strong>Where:</strong> Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> Living room renovation to expand + kitchen remodel in a 900-square-foot co-op<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><strong>Notable:</strong> The remodel transformed a cramped living room into a swanky billiards chamber.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><strong>Result:</strong> An open kitchen, a dry bar with party potential and plenty of room to cue pool</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>

</ul>
<h3>A living room renovation gives room for a fave sport</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes even man-cave passions are well worth making room for. Designer Bennett Gale knew this when he agreed to help his friend Dan, who had <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased a one-bedroom apartment</a> in a 1960 New York City building, with its remodel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“For the longest time, the only piece of furniture that Dan had—before he even bought a bed—was a pool table,” recalled Bennett, who works as a project manager for a luxury real-estate developer. The dark-wood billiards console—sturdy, angular, and clad in camel-toned felt—was a prized possession and an essential feature in the project. Dan, a finance executive who’d moved into the co-op about a year before starting on the redesign, had made it the apartment’s centerpiece.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A pool table in a Manhattan apartment may sound like a literal elephant in the room, but Bennett, who had been close with Dan since college, understood its importance and was happy to discuss it. The table had a modern design and good bones. With a set of 4 &#8211; 5 table leaves that let it multitask as a dining surface, the nifty four-legged table was also practical—Dan had gathered many a friend around it. The issue was that his otherwise sparsely set living room felt tight when the table was in use. “I wanted to create more space around it,” said Dan. Plus, more elbow room would be useful for pool cues!</span></p>
<h3>Planning an entertainment space at home</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dan and Bennett worked together to post the job on Sweeten and soon hired a contractor. Then they set out to upgrade the co-op into the ultimate bachelor’s pad. (Note: Dan&#8217;s girlfriend has moved in since the renovation—and reportedly, loves the space.) The original scope of the project, Bennett said, grew substantially. “We’d planned to open up the wall between the kitchen and the living room, but once we dug into the plans, it became clear that by taking out a few walls and relocating a closet, we could make better use of the space.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He proposed a full reconfiguration that would knock out a lot of flow-hampering sheetrock, give the kitchen an eye-catching redo, and elevate the living room to become a spacious entertaining hub. The makeover would bring light and a chic, loft-like sprawl to the downtown apartment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Conversations about specifics began in the kitchen. Bennett and Dan put a lot of research into cohesive surfacing choices. “Dark-wood parquet flooring dominates a lot of the space,” Bennett said, “so we lightened up the walls and chose materials that coordinated with the wood.” Dan opted for kitchen cabinets in a custom textured veneer with blond accents; dark matte-bronze cabinet hardware and coordinating lighting fixtures complement the stained wood. The natural marble that Dan settled on for the countertops is a warm white with earth-toned veining that echoes the deep brown pool and dining table.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45404 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="kitchen bar" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Sample testing the countertop materials</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Quality and durability were primary factors. Dan had decided to go “all in” on <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural marble for the countertops</a> and backsplash. “We did countless tests on countertop samples in order to determine whether we should go with honed marble or polished,” Bennett said. “Olive oil, red wine, hot sauce, pickle juice, and soda were tested to observe how it would stain or etch.” Dan chose a matte honed finish, which is more resistant to discoloration and allows scratches and marks to blend. “From multiple slabs, we identified one with as much veining and movement as possible,” Bennett said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With materials picked and sourced, the real work began. The crew opened the kitchen, installed cabinetry and appliances, and created a three-stooled stretch of counter seating on the opening’s living-room side. From there, the apartment’s other unnecessary walls got the sledgehammer. Bennett’s plan included taking out a hallway wall to give more space around the pool table.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To complete the space expansion, the removal of a corner closet revealed a protruding column. Bennett designed a dry bar to fill the accidental niche. “That awkward corner became a great opportunity,” Bennett said. “We negotiated with the contractor to have the bar included in the build-out. It ended up as a great display.” The closet was relocated to an oversized and inefficient foyer.</span></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Choosing the right general contractor team</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is the case in most every home-construction job, the team hit some snags. During demolition, contractors discovered that the electrical wiring needed to be upgraded. Bennett emphasizes the importance of reading and understanding co-op or condo board rules and sharing them with contractors, who must not only work within the regulations, but also lock in the appropriate licenses and insurance coverages for the project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A cooperative relationship between the construction crew and building staff is an absolute must, according to Bennett. “Get the super involved early,” he says. &#8220;These individuals almost always have previous experience with renovations in the building, and can often provide valuable insight on the exact issues you’ll encounter.” Fortunately, Dan received support from Sweeten throughout the process, and from Bennett, his friend (and architect!) “I would have been lost without his experience, guidance, and recommendations, not to mention his help pushing back on the contractors and the building when I needed it,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All challenges aside, though, “I’m very happy with the finished product,” Dan said. “I accomplished exactly what I was looking to do.” </span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Bennett and Dan, for sharing the results of a great collaboration! </em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Around the end of last year, Elliot, a Graphic Designer, and Katie, a Benefit Specialist, decided that the time had come to take the scary but sensible plunge and become first-time homeowners of an older 1,800 sq/ft, 2-story townhouse in Williamsburg. The couple fell in love with this house&#8217;s lovely bones, plus it had a backyard for their dog, Desmond; but what they did not love was that it had the common NYC problem of disjointed spaces caused by a layout of many smaller rooms, not to mention the interior&#8217;s outdated <em><span style="color: #000000;">everything</span></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the couple had never done a renovation before, they were excited by the idea of fixing up an older home. So the next task was to find their general contractor, which wouldn&#8217;t be easy (they thought) since they didn&#8217;t know many other homeowners, and therefore word-of-mouth was out of the question. After hearing about our resources at Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katie &amp; Elliot posted their project</a> right away to get matched with members of the Sweeten Network. After comparing their matches, the young homeowners chose to put their project in the trustworthy hands of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten general contractor</a> focused on sustainable design-building. The contractor worked with the renovation newbies to think through everything from the practicality of materials to overall design concepts, before beginning construction on their 4-month project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10650 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10651 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10652 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Katie &amp; Elliot&#8217;s first order of business was to re-do the kitchen so that they could finally enjoy eating-in, as much as they do dining out at their favorite neighborhood spot. Ecostruct enlarged the space by opening up existing entranceways and creating larger floor-to-ceiling cabinet systems. During demolition, Ecostruct&#8217;s team, lead by Jon Eklund, found that the existing plumbing needed to be replaced because it was not up to code (and was actually a ticking time bomb inside their walls). This added some extra time, expenses, and maybe a few gray hairs to the project, but both the homeowners and Jon&#8217;s team were confident that it was a problem worth solving right away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10653 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10654 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10655 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luckily, Elliot and Katie have similar taste when it comes to interiors. The couple wanted to create a home that had a warm, clean and modern feel with plenty of light. For the kitchen, they choose to use both recessed lighting and Caravaggio Matte Grey Pendant Lights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10656 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jon helped Elliot and Katie think about the new materials in terms of cost, aesthetics and sustainability &#8211; triple bonus! The couple picked Caesarstone in White Farina for their countertops which is known not just for its simplified fabrication and installation process that makes it budget-friendly, but also for its nonporous and scratch resistant qualities which will help it retain a perfect surface without sealants or waxes, keeping harmful toxins out of the home. For the floors, the couple went with Mirage Knotty Walnut floors throughout the living room, open kitchen and dining room. The wood adds nice warmth to the space and its natural irregularities make a nice contrast with the white clean lines of their kitchen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether it was the mix of mid-90’s earth toned floor-to-ceiling tiles, black accented toilet seat, or the fact that the faulty old pipes in the walls were about to bust open, updating this bathroom was a must. I loved how, by continuing with the same color palette and general clean aesthetic of the adjacent kitchen, the bathroom  now reads as an integrated part of the home and less of a time warp.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The living room is tied both aesthetically and visually by opening up the island and updating the dry bar so the ever so hospitable Katie or Elliot can do what they do best, serve their lucky guests a cocktail while cooking up a meal in the kitchen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the entry foyer, the homeowners had Jon&#8217;s team replace the front door and repaint the concrete flooring and wood staircase; they also hung a nice big <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/park-slope-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mirror that looks pretty familiar</a>. I really like the shabby-chic but very gender-neutral vibe of the foyer, which I&#8217;m sure is making many great first impressions for the Katie and Elliot&#8217;s visiting friends and family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks and congrats to Katie and Elliot! And a big thanks to Jon and his team at Ecostruct!</p>
