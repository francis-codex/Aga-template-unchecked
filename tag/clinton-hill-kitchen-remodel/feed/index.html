										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Laura uploaded seventeen “before” photos to her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten project post</a>, a few things were very clear: if you could look past the black-paint-encrusted kitchen cabinets and cracked purple bath tiles, these Aussie expats had the makings of a spacious apartment with oversized windows in one of Brooklyn’s loveliest little neighborhoods. But the home’s tight nooks made it hard to even get a clear “before” photo of any one room. The layout was segmented with lots of little walls and doors, the parquet flooring had long ago given way, and the bathroom was filled with miniaturized fixtures. With sights set on a summer wedding and juggling all of the budget demands that come with new homeownership, we introduced Laura and Matthew to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a> for a kitchen, bathroom, ceiling, and flooring renovation in their Clinton Hill co-op!</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="laura-with-husband-on-chair" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48105 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-After-1.jpg" alt="laura posing with her husband on a chair in living room with hardwood floors and windows with black frames after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-After-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-After-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-After-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&#8220;This was definitely a dream on a budget and our contractor and his incredible team really made that happen! The Sweeten process and people were amazing and we really can&#8217;t thank them enough for all of their help. We are gearing up for 70 Australians to come to our wedding &#8211; SO SO excited to show them what we have created!&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; Laura, Brooklyn homeowner</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The plans were ambitious but clear: demolish the kitchen wall to unite the kitchen, dining, and living rooms, re-build cabinetry and replace all finishes, gut the bathroom, clear out popcorn ceilings, and redo the floors. The demolition would leave a support column in place and center entertaining and seating around a new island, all in an entirely upgraded space.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="hallway-and-bathroom-before-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48117 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-2.jpg" alt="two images of hallway with hardwood floors and small bathroom with pedastal sink and toilet before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> <img decoding="async" title="small-kitchen-before-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48116 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-1.jpg" alt="small kitchen with floating shelves and gas cooking range before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Laura-Kitchen-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tired parquet flooring came up and warm wood planks went down in their place. The original kitchen cabinets appeared to have been painted many times over—when Laura and Matthew adopted them they were thick with black paint. The couple had put in long hours at Ikea to design new cabinets, and their contractor&#8217;s team did the heavy lifting to install double lines of cabinetry in dove gray with brushed brass pulls. A large island now separates the kitchen from the living room, while offering bar seating, plenty of table space for entertaining, and hidden storage underneath. Mismatched counters were replaced with striking butcher block, and the sink was swapped for a deep stainless version with a tall, elegant faucet. Laura and Matthew chose an ivory honeycomb backsplash with gray grout and upgraded appliances to sleek stainless steel.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Ohhh, look! There&#8217;s that iconic Clinton Hill Co-op kitchen window…!</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom had also presumably seen kinder days. The floor consisted of gray tiles accented with smaller black and white pieces arranged in an art deco pattern, providing plenty of creative inspiration to work with while maintaining a familiar color theme throughout the home.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s team removed the bathroom door and re-created the entry with a sliding track door—a huge space-saving move. Laura and Matthew chose stark all-white subway wall tiles lined with contrasting gray grout to replace the former lavender ones&#8211;many of them broken. The tub stayed with a glaze refresh and gained a large rain showerhead and new fixtures. The big surprise in the bathroom came in the form of a brightly lacquered red vanity, adding a serious punch of color and modernity. A double-sided mirrored medicine cabinet brings extra storage, and strip lighting was upgraded to a streamlined bulb set. The newly expanded vanity carves out just enough room for a simple two-piece white porcelain toilet.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s work in the bedroom was more cosmetic but equally transformative. The building&#8217;s corner beams and beautiful windows are the focal point now that the popcorn ceilings and parquet floors are gone!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I purchased a one-bedroom co-op apartment in Clinton Hill almost five years ago after selling the condo I owned in New Jersey. With a tenant living in my NJ home, I’d been renting a place in Bed-Stuy for more than two years and I figured it was time to try to fulfill my goal of owning in Brooklyn. My new place was a sponsor unit on a high floor with expansive east-facing views. The kitchen had (what seemed at the time) pretty good upgrades: black granite counters, black tile flooring, and new stainless steel appliances. The cabinets, though not my favorite style, were perfectly fine. My friends were pretty impressed with my new digs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did have the chance to take down the zig-zagging wall partition that separated the kitchen from the living room during contract negotiations, but I was too indecisive and stressed from the purchasing process to pull the trigger. At the time, most of my efforts in the kitchen involved making toast and coffee, so being a little cramped didn&#8217;t seem like an issue. But after closing, I sank into a brief period of buyer’s remorse. Those cabinets, which had seemed just fine, were actually pretty shabbily installed: nothing was level, the hinges had paper stuffed into them to make them close properly, and the fridge was jammed in between the counter and the kitchen wall. When I opened the fridge doors, they would hit the doorway and chip away at the door frame. I was totally bummed. Hoping for a quick fix, I contacted the folks who’d done the work to re-do the entryway and replace the refrigerator, but I wasn’t any happier with how it all looked after that second try.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A few months in, I started to see a recurring water leak from the neighbors upstairs &#8211; more than once, water poured down through my cabinets, causing the kitchen walls and cabinet surfaces to bow and fade. By this point, I was pretty down on the kitchen. I&#8217;d already removed some of the damaged cabinetry from the wall and had lived for a year with an entire section missing. I knew I wanted to renovate, but I hesitated with the potential cost and the fear of another flood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I learned that some of my neighbors had gone through <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find contractors for their renovations and I was surprised and encouraged by the variety of configurations available for what felt like a pretty limited space. So I finally <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3555" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project on Sweeten</a>, envisioning a grown-up kitchen with an island/peninsula, fully open to the living room. I didn’t really have a vision for what I wanted besides something that would play well with the living room décor. I like warm colors, oranges and browns, and I specified that I needed experts who could handle both the design and build of the space. Sweeten introduced me to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a>, and I liked them immediately. Paulina has a great attitude and personality, plus she’s a trained architect with design ideas that make so much sense. She seemed as excited about designing it as I was, so it was an easy decision to move forward with the team.<span id="more-12995"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During our first design meeting, we talked color scheme and finishes. What blew my mind was that the very next night, Paulina sent me sketches that basically represented what the kitchen looks like now that it is completed. I’d read references from other clients about Paulina on Sweeten that talked about how she was very reliable and would take care of everything. And that’s absolutely true. As someone who had never done a major home project, I was freaking out a little bit over how overwhelming it all seemed.  But after visiting Paulina and Albert&#8217;s shop in Queens, I was so encouraged and relieved, knowing I was working with real professionals. At that meeting, we picked the cabinetry style and she gave me two samples for countertop material and two options for cabinet lacquer color, totally respecting my wish to not be deluged with choices. She also talked me out of unnecessarily changing the kitchen floor, one of the best cost- and time-saving decisions of the reno.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Once work started, everything seemed to happen very fast. Paulina&#8217;s designs pulled in my color scheme across the custom solid wood cabinets, painted to color-match Benjamin Moore&#8217;s <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/redirects/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=earlymorningmist&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Morning Mist</a>. Albert created a walnut veneer, open corner cabinet above the sink, and continued the walnut accents with a soffit, floor to ceiling pipe cover, and dining peninsula. I found the recycled glass penny tile backsplash at <a href="https://www.completetile.com/products/glass/zumi_glass/color_sizes_and_specifications/34-penny-round/zumi-glass-mosaic-cypress-brown-natural-complete-tile-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complete Tile</a> in Manhattan &#8211; exactly what I was looking for &#8211; and I also chose the quartzite counters in Madreperola/Mother of Pearl. The stone is my favorite thing about the new space &#8211; it&#8217;s like having a piece of fine art right in my kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I chose a simple metallic bronze knob for the cabinets from <a href="https://www.myknobs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">myknobs.com</a> and I picked up door handles for the storage under the dining peninsula from <a href="https://www.overstock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Overstock</a>. Paulina recommended some very cool pendant lights from Restoration Hardware and I found a budget-friendly alternative from Brooklyn Bulb Co. To solve a space issue, I decided to replace my dishwasher with an 18-inch <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a> model, allowing Paulina and Albert to create two full lines of base cabinets along the kitchen&#8217;s back wall. The dividing wall came down (you can see my boyfriend&#8217;s little farewell graffiti from the night before the demo!), the cabinet bases went in, the soffit and pipe cover were installed, and the next thing I knew, the counters were brought in and we were just about done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I never thought I could or would have such a funky kitchen. I would say I’m most appreciative toward Sweeten and Paulina and Albert for making this process, for the most part, worry-free. Paulina and Albert stuck to my budget and managed to keep the project on schedule despite my kitchen&#8217;s persistent attempts to put us behind with some unhelpful wall crookedness. The craftsmanship of the kitchen is fantastic and apparent, from the way the floor was seamlessly patched to the super cool way the cabinets are finished underneath with LED lights, to the bonus upper and lower cabinets next to the stove (which also cleverly hide pipes). I love the wee pull-out spice cabinet! I’m not exaggerating when I say it’s like a minor miracle happened with this project.</p>
