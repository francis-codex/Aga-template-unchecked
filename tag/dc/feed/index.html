<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a quick overview of budgets for some standard renovation projects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Gut renovation: Starting at <strong>$100</strong> per square foot (psf)<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen remodel: Starting at </span><span class="s3"><strong>$20,000</strong>—<strong>$25,000</strong></span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at </span><span class="s3"><strong>$30,000</strong>—<strong>$40,000</strong></span><strong><span class="s4"> </span></strong><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at </span><strong><span class="s3">$68,000</span></strong><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Budget bathroom remodel: </span><span class="s3">Starting at<strong> $12,000</strong>—<strong>$15,000</strong></span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Starting at </span><strong><span class="s3">$21,000</span></strong> <span class="s5">or <strong>$600</strong> psf.</span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">High-end bathroom remodel and extension: </span><span class="s3">Starting at <strong>$40,000</strong></span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Adding square footage: Starts at <strong>$120</strong> psf<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Total Gut Renovation Costs for a DC Home</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A total gut renovation in Washington DC that brings a home down to its frame and studs could start at around </span><span class="s4"><strong>$100</strong> psf</span><span class="s1">. Doing it all at once will get you the best price per square foot if you are already planning multiple projects. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much does a Washington DC kitchen remodel cost per square foot?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A best-value kitchen remodel typically starts between </span><span class="s3"><strong>$20,000</strong>—<strong>$25,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. This allows the replacement of cabinets and countertops from big-box stores, a stocked appliance package, and tile flooring.<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">For a mid-grade kitchen, expect starting costs between </span><span class="s3"><strong>$30,000</strong>—<strong>$40,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. This pricepoint would include semi-custom cabinets, hardwood floors, upgrade in appliances, and an island (with no sink).<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/washington-dc/"><span class="s2">report</span></a> found the average cost in the Washington DC area costs around <strong>$68,000</strong>. This works out to be <strong>$340</strong> psf. About 60 percent of the cost is recouped in the value it adds to your home. With a budget of this amount, you can remodel a 200-square-foot space with countertops, semi-custom wood cabinets, and a stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet. It also allows the addition of a built-in microwave, dishwasher, and custom lighting. Other than<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/"><span class="s2"> adding a kitchen island</span></a>, the layout, such as where the oven and dishwasher are installed, must remain the same as the original design. Keeping your layout will be the biggest influence in a low budget down.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">For a high-end kitchen remodel, costs start at </span><strong><span class="s3">$68,000</span></strong><span class="s1"> and include a stone or marble countertop as well as opening up the space or removing a wall.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A luxury remodel comes in at an average of <strong>$135,000</strong> for Washington DC, the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/washington-dc/"><span class="s2">report</span></a> found. The psf cost is <strong>$675</strong>. This project can add 58 percent of the budget to your home’s value. A high-end kitchen remodel can consist of custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported ceramic or glass tile backsplashes. The appliances would also kick up a few notches to include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood. The kitchen can also have designer faucets and a water filtration system.</span></p>

<h3></h3>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much does a DC bathroom remodel cost per square foot?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">For a best-value bathroom, expect a typical project to start between </span><span class="s3"><strong>$12,000</strong>—<strong>$15,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. At this budget, it would not be a gut but a refresh.<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A mid-grade bathroom remodel has costs at </span><strong><span class="s3">$21,000</span></strong><span class="s1"> or <strong>$600</strong> psf. These figures come from the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/new-england/boston-ma/"><span class="s2">report</span></a>. For this price,  you can remodel a 35-square-foot bathroom. It includes adding a porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. This renovation can add <strong>$14,000</strong> to a home’s value. That’s 65 percent of the project’s cost.<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A high-end bathroom remodel starts at </span><strong><span class="s3">$40,000</span></strong><span class="s1">. This budget includes a 3 or 4-piece bath such as the sink, shower/tub combination, and toilet. For <strong>$67,000</strong>, a 5-piece bathroom could be installed.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the 2020 Cost Vs Value report, the average price in this category is around <strong>$67,000</strong>. For this price, you can expand your bathroom from 35 square feet to 100 square feet. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/remodeling-a-bathroom-six-trends-to-consider-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new bathroom</a> can have features like a freestanding soaker tub. On top of that, you can have a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. Your budget can also afford a double sink and double-mirror vanity with custom draws and wall cabinets.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding square footage to your DC home </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enlarging living space to an existing floor plan starts at <strong>$120</strong> psf and can easily go up to <strong>$20</strong>0 psf. The most economical addition is adding square footage over a crawl space. An extension where you are adding or adjusting the foundations will come in around <strong>$150</strong> psf. The cost increases to <strong>$200</strong> psf if a wet space—bathroom, laundry, or kitchen—is added. </span><span class="s1">The cost of adding a second floor can start at <strong>$150</strong> psf.  </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Remodeling costs in DC: Permits</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The District of Columbia is a compact city of only 69 square miles. The Council of the District of Columbia issues building permits for this area. Permits cost two percent of the budget for work over <strong>$1,000</strong>. For example, a permit for <strong>$20,000</strong> bathroom will cost <strong>$400</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Prince George’s County, to the east and south of the city, uses an equation for <a href="https://princegeorgescountymd.gov/DocumentCenter/View/23559/DPIE-Fee-Schedule-PDF?bidId="><span class="s2">permit fees</span></a>. <strong>$50</strong> + (Construction Costs x 0.008) = permit fee. So, a <strong>$20,000</strong> renovation would cost <strong>$210</strong>. Watch out for specific fees for projects such as basement finishing which is <strong>$340</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Montgomery County, the area to the north,<a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/DPS/Resources/Files/IT/AllFees.pdf"><span class="s2"> building permits</span></a> for alterations, additions, and repairs start at <strong>$270</strong>.</span></p>
