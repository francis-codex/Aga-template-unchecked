			<h2 class="p1">From kitchens and outdoor spaces to flex rooms, Chicago home design trends point to customization, utility, and eye-grabbing accents</h2>
<p class="p2"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="tiny-breakfast-nook-green-wallpaper" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50583 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_unpatterned-built-in-banquette-mudroom-feature.jpg" alt="tiny breakfast nook with round table and chairs and green wallpaper after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_unpatterned-built-in-banquette-mudroom-feature.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_unpatterned-built-in-banquette-mudroom-feature-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_unpatterned-built-in-banquette-mudroom-feature-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Chicago design project by Carly Moeller.

<p>Like homeowners nationally, those in Chicago are looking to remodel their homes to do more and with style.</p>
<p>When tackling remodeling projects, they’re going beyond what’s new. They’re considering exactly what they want, prioritizing to meet the budget. The overriding themes: comfort, convenience, cleanliness, and wellness.</p>
<p>With the help of interior designers, <a href="http://www.unpatterned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carly Moeller of Unpatterned</a>, and <a href="https://inspiredinteriors.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emily Mackie of Inspired Interior</a>, both based in Chicago, we explore Chicago home design trends to watch.</p>
<h3>What Chicagoans want in a home renovation</h3>
<p class="p2">Spaces topping remodeling lists in Chicago haven’t changed much—kitchen, bath, and outdoor. But the ingredients and wish lists have. In addition, there is a new desire for multitasking areas. Some actually point to a move away from open-concept plans to spaces with more definition. Still, the open kitchen/family room is a winning combination.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="white-living-gray-wall-panelling" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50585 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors.jpg" alt="white living room with gray wall panelling and long windows after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above) Design project by Emily Mackie in Chicago. Photos by Michael Alan Kaskel</em></span>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whole house renovations</a>—gutting as well as <a href="https://chicago.curbed.com/2020/2/28/21152809/adu-chicago-legalization-coach-house-granny-flat-affordable-housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding on or building up</a>—are still on track. Perhaps even more popular is reconfiguring an existing footprint. It’s a creative challenge that’s also <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2020-home-renovation-costs-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost-effective</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Chicago homeowners are less inclined to go to cookie-cutter plans. Instead, they’re opting for customization, making remodeled spaces their own. Making sustainable materials choices also is more intentional.</p>
<p class="p2">“Remodeling is a little less restrictive,” said designer Carly Moeller. “It’s not about ‘Is this OK for resale?” It’s about how I want it. Am I happy when I walk in? Making it your own.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">Kitchens increase function and style</h3>
<h4>Cabinetry and appliances</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Kitchen cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frameless styles convey clean lines</a>, with modern hardware or without. Move away from the extra carvings and moldings. Look for a shift from neutral—especially all white. Most liked: hues from soothing, livable shades like blue-green, blues, and greens.</li>
<li class="p2">Islands are changing shape and size.  &#8220;Stepping down&#8221; creates multiple levels of countertop for different functions. Longer, narrower islands also are a different look. Some cantilever over a perpendicular “table.” Others house storage on one end, while open space to pull up chairs is on the other.</li>
<li class="p2">Induction cooktops are gaining fans. The method cooks food more quickly and is more energy-efficient. Plus French chefs have given them a seal of approval.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p2">Countertops and fixtures</h4>
<ul>
<li>Quartz is the new stone. Porcelain slabs also offer an alternative. Color, pattern, with dramatic veining spice up a range of looks beyond white marble. Both boast antibacterial properties and are easier to clean.</li>
<li>Tile backsplashes are making a splash with texture, tone-on-tone patterns, and geometric shapes.</li>
<li class="p2">So does statement lighting. Hanging pendants in multiples, ramped-up scale, and large horizontal fixtures lend importance. Organic shapes add appeal.</li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s2">Metal finishes for faucets and hardware add sophistication and modernity. Burnished gold and matte black are popular.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Whole-home features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Smart Home tech connects smartphones with more activities in the home. Security, lighting, window shades, refrigerator thermostats, and range features (with cameras that monitor contents and cooking)</li>
<li class="p2">Ceilings are becoming a focal point. Wood beams, beadboard (painted or natural wood), and even wallpaper train our eyes upwards.</li>
<li class="p2">Wide plank wood flooring still is in vogue. However, very wide (12 inches) boards are less common than 5—7 inches.  “We’re definitely using a lot of lighter finishes,” said Emily Mackie. “Limewashed looks.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">A place for everything: Storage in the spotlight</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Pantries are top of the wish list. Organization is essential. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walk-in pantries</a> are preferred if there’s room. Otherwise, pantry “cupboards” or pullouts feature cubbies for everything from spices to canned and packaged goods. “Homeowners want to be more creative about how they use space,” said Carly.</li>
<li class="p2">Prep kitchens—High-end designers find that clients like to separate prep from presentation and entertaining. The design includes a butler&#8217;s pantry-type of space or “second kitchen” that keeps the mess out of sight.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" title="bar-area-black-cabinets" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50584 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors.jpg" alt="bar area with black cabinets and black leather chairs and long panelled glass windows after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><em><span class="img-label">(Above) Design project by Emily Mackie in Chicago. Photos by Dustin Halleck Photography.</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Breakfast bars, bars, other built-ins—Organization drives these dedicated spaces. Equipment, accessories and cups, glasses, etc. all are within easy reach. “I did an a.m./p.m. cafe,” said Emily. “We took a portion of the kitchen and made it a mini coffee bar by day and a wine bar by night.”</li>
<li class="p2">Mudrooms—Some designers predict the demise of mudrooms. Still, the need for a place to contain outerwear, footwear, and sporting equipment isn’t going away soon. “I don’t have a mudroom at my house,” said Emily. “But I have a dedicated closet space.”</li>
<li class="p2">Look for more hybrid spaces. For a couple with three children, Carly was asked to design storage space that would feel seamless, as it spilled into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modest-sized kitchen</a> and family room. Her solution: three lockers, one for each child, bench to one side with storage inside. For symmetry, there’s a table with a bench and chairs on the other side of the cabinets. She painted the wall and lockers bright blue.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">Baths focus on refreshing body and mind</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Freestanding, shapely tubs are as much of a dramatic focus as they fill a need to chill out. The spa aesthetic is a target. Air tubs take over whirlpools while soaking tubs are most popular. “I’ve been doing a lot more soaking tubs,” said Emily.</li>
<li class="p2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roomy showers</a> still favor rain effects and multiple showerheads. Even better is built-in sound.</li>
<li class="p2">Bidet toilets or toilet seats—Hygiene is a huge driver;  plus, you don’t have to worry about running out of toilet paper.</li>
<li class="p2">Slab installations are gaining ground, especially with lighter-weight materials like porcelain. The seamless, groutless look gets a huge nod of approval.</li>
<li class="p2">Some storage ideas borrow from the kitchen. Emily created a bubble bath bar with a display rack for bath oils, crystals, and salts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">Outdoor rooms are at-home getaways</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Compartmentalizing the landscape makes it flow from the indoors. Following interior cues, the goal is to create <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/renovate-an-outdoor-space-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spaces for sitting, lounging</a>, entertaining, cooking, and dining. All in a green context, with plantings of trees, shrubs, and flowers.</li>
<li class="p2">Roof decks, usually on the top of the garage are a solution for shrinking yard space. This requires adequate structure to hold furnishings, kitchens, and landscaping, with built-in irrigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" title="rooftop-deck-gray-table" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50586 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors.jpg" alt="deck on rooftop with gray table and chairs and teak tile floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;">(Above) Design project by Emily Mackie in Chicago. Photos by Dustin Halleck Photography.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Outdoor kitchens feature built-in grills, refrigerators, sinks, and specialty equipment like kegerators to dispense draft beer. In the Midwest, pizza ovens are often part of the design. Chicago at-home chefs even use them in the winter—they just shovel a path.</li>
<li class="p2">Freestanding heaters and built-in fireplaces extend the season. A range of firepit styles offers additional options.</li>
<li class="p2">Water features like ponds or small containers with waterfalls add a vacation vibe.</li>
<li class="p2">Entertainment includes outdoor-safe TVs and screens for movie-watching. “People are trying to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find ways to escape</a>,” said Emily. “When the home becomes the office, where do you go? Where there used to be square footage with a singular purpose, now I feel it’s a.m. and p.m.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">Chicago home office goes beyond Zoom</h3>
<p class="p2">The home office has re-emerged, whether standalone or integrated into the kitchen or family rooms. Flex work styles are more plentiful. So homeowners are thinking again about WFH spaces—even dedicated ones. Converting extra bedrooms or a spot in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/basement/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement</a> offer options besides integrating into kitchen/family rooms.</p>
<p class="p2">“Basement offices have become hodgepodge rooms,” said Carly. “One client needed flex space for kids to work, so we did three built-in desks with shelving.”</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="gray-workstation-niche-open-shelves" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50582 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned.jpg" alt="gray workstation niche with open shelves and white desk after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">(Above) Chicago design project by Carly Moeller. Photos by Dustin Halleck Photography.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Bedroom/bath suites are sanctuaries</h3>
<p class="p2">This remains a prime candidate for opening up small rooms or moving walls. “In one, we turned the top floor into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary suite</a>,” said Carly. “There had been two smaller bedrooms and a bath.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">Making room for hobbies, games, and exercise</h3>
<p class="p2">Activities like crafts, exercising, gaming, indoor driving ranges are inspiring re-dedication of real estate, especially in basements.  There’s a need for versatility and multitasking flex spaces. <span class="s2">This is not unlike the megamansion feature a few years back: dedicated rooms for wrapping packages.</span></p>
<p class="p2">“Workout and meditation rooms also are requested. Square footage needs to be multifunctional,&#8221; said Emily. &#8220;Clients now are considering more creative solutions. &#8216;Why don’t we rip out the dining room and put in a killer lounge?&#8217;” She continued, <span class="s2">“I converted my own garage. Lounge chairs, leftover rugs, heaters—for the kids.</span>&#8220;The City Council of Chicago has removed a ban that had prohibited ADUs since 1957. Be sure to find a contractor who is <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up-to-date on local codes and regulations</a>.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Expanding space with visual tricks</h3>
<p class="p2">Adding large windows and skylights brings in natural light and visually expands space. Also, without adding square footage, raising ceiling heights makes a room live larger.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Chicago home design trends: Making a statement</h3>
<p class="p2">Chicagoans are personalizing more in home remodeling. There’s more room for a little drama. Focal points include sculptural bathtubs, kitchen islands punctuated with bold veining, or floor-to-ceiling featured fireplaces. Solving clutter in clean, functional spaces that are comfortable and make you feel good is the goal.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>We’re back again this week with Part 2 of Nazli and Larry’s historic Brooklyn brownstone renovation in Bedford-Stuyvesant. If you missed it—check out <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part I</a></i></span><span class="s1"><i> where Nazli walked us through their planning process and showed off the foyer and guest suite. Here, she shows off the rest of the parlor floor, including the kitchen, the dining room, and the powder room. Nazli explains the challenge of merging modern and traditional within the confines of a townhouse’s long and narrow configuration. Read on for her thoughts on powder rooms (wackiness is key), decorative mantels (rather pointless), and coming to terms with the budget required to achieve the renovation you want (very tough).</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think the biggest challenge to any renovation is…the renovators obviously. There will always be a push and pull between the architect, the contractor, and the owners. And most of the time, that will yield a better product than any single entity could have envisioned (but not always). I think our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect was fantastic</a> in coming up with some great solutions to space challenges–especially on the parlor floor, where I insisted we needed a half-bath that was nowhere near the kitchen (because, gross), a hall closet, and a kitchen pantry. She really provided a lot of help in making sure the house was up to code and that the spaces flowed. Our contractor (and my husband’s best friend), did an awesome job of value engineering so we could get the most bang for our buck. The decorating of the spaces was left mostly to me and it was interesting trying to figure out my own taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We, like all imperfect clients, wanted this Brooklyn brownstone renovated on a contractor&#8217;s-grade budget. Obviously, we were being silly and went way over budget (and right at what our contractor told us it would cost; we were just deeply in denial about the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of construction</a> in NYC). The mechanicals in a home are so expensive that basically most of the money was gone before we made a single design choice. And for me, I care deeply about the fixtures, finishes, and materials and I wasn’t about to cheap out on the things we had to see and use every day. So just be honest with yourself about what you want and what you’re willing to pay or give up for it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I was most excited about the kitchen<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>if that hasn’t already been made clear. I love throwing huge parties and dinners, and I like to spend my alone time cooking. It’s also a natural gathering spot, so it was exciting to think about getting the most out of the space. Turns out the space configuration of a Brooklyn brownstone made it hard to do that, but it still served us well—I am super happy with a long <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> (11 feet long!), a BlueStar stove, and the different stations for cooking, eating, making coffee, or baking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen is my happy spot and I’ve spent years thinking about what makes a good kitchen. Is this ideal space planning? Nope. Is this my idea of a good time? For sure. The challenge was how to devise an open-plan area that was going to take up so much of the parlor floor without making it feel like a separate room. My solution was to forgo upper <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> so there&#8217;s a clear line of vision from the front of the room all the way to the dining room. This created a storage challenge for me, of course, which we solved with a kitchen pantry. I wanted the pantry to be open so that I could see and access all my ingredients easily, but I also didn’t want a lot of visual clutter. I <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painted</a> the cabinets and shelves a deep gray (same color as the island cabinets), which makes the whole space disappear once I turn out the light. I found a piece of scrap marble at the stone yard which I used for the kitchen backsplash and the countertops along the back wall closest to the pantry. Marble is expensive and hard to maintain, so my thought was to use it in low-use areas to give the look and feel of the material throughout the kitchen without spending that much. For the island and other countertops, I used poured concrete, which is a material I love. Surprisingly, it’s also pretty delicate, but it’s subtle and earthy and I like how it ages. The kitchen is, again, more traditional than I would have preferred, but I think the concrete and the open shelving give it a more modern touch. Also, I fought to get a second sink in the kitchen and am so happy I won that battle. It’s handy to set up a water station so people can grab water or rinse out cups without interrupting my cooking space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I can’t say enough about how much I love these herringbone walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>. We splurged on these floors and went with the less costly white oak for the upstairs floors because…well, just look at them. My original vision was to have the tile floor in the kitchen, but it made more sense to continue the wood on the whole parlor floor and save the tile for the back extension. We mocked up the island with plywood and adjusted it until I was happy with the dimensions—how it felt to go from sink to stove, or how easy it was to take food out of the fridge and place it on the counter. That kind of stuff is important to me, and this was the first time I really got to design my own kitchen for myself. Everything is a bit taller and it suits me just great.</p>
<p>A note on accessibility: I’ve had friends and families with different mobility and impairment issues—whether wheelchair-bound, deaf, or arthritic—and time spent with them has made me very conscious of what it means to design well for many. A landmarked Brooklyn brownstone is a nightmare for anyone with a wheelchair, a walker, or a stroller, and I also saw firsthand some of the challenges that my design choices presented.</p>
<p>The first set of cabinet pulls in the kitchen were a lovely set of straight, minimalist tab pulls. I loved that they gave the kitchen a more modern look. Cue my mother and mother-in-law coming over all the time and struggling with the pulls. They couldn’t grasp the straight pull with their arthritic fingers. I switched them out right away for pulls with a fully curved handle. Now they can just stick their finger under the pull, and a small motion opens the drawers. People keep talking about their &#8220;forever homes,&#8221; but really think about how you, your guests, and your children will have to adapt to the spaces as everyone starts to get older.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other end of our Brooklyn brownstone, and connected to the kitchen, is the dining room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar</a>. We love this room. We really felt like this room, a back extension added in the 1910s, was the reason we bought this place. Then we sadly rebuilt the entire room, but somehow, it’s still our favorite space in the house. So that was a great surprise—buying a house because of one room and then recreating it and still having that be the best spot in the house. It’s our dining room and bar, but we also have space under the dining bench to store all of Nacho’s gear so that he can draw and play at the table while I am cooking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From being in other friends’ homes, I knew that extensions were always freezing cold and hard to heat. All I wanted was Moroccan tile for this room (in fact, for the whole house, but we just didn’t have the budget for that). Everyone fought me on adding radiant heating to the subfloor, but it’s by far the warmest room during the winter. Larry and I often come home and lie down on the floor and accidentally fall asleep! During the summer, this is the room we hang out in while kids run in and out of the house to the backyard. The best surprise? That giant Tiffany stained-glass window, which was hidden by a crappy 1970’s bookcase on the inside and vinyl siding on the outside. As soon as we bought the house, we ripped down the bookcase hoping we’d find a window, and lo and behold, we did. It was in near perfect condition. We completely sealed it with clear glass on the outside to avoid damage and heat loss, as we did with all the other stained glass details around the parlor floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a large fireplace in this room, but I couldn’t figure out how to fit the mantel and Larry’s bar, and after much cajoling, I finally convinced Larry to agree to rip out the fireplace. The mantel has a new home in the living room, where the original had been removed previously. I will say, to the horror of preservationists everywhere, that I wish we didn’t have our mantels—they don’t work, they take up too much space, and they create artificial focal points in every room. Maybe if they were marble, I’d appreciate them more. It’s form without function, which I have no love for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The powder room was a tough one to figure out. I hate the idea of guests having to go upstairs to use the bathroom, and with a small child, it&#8217;s great to have a bathroom on every floor. I think powder rooms should be wacky. This one is tiny, so doing a fun wallpaper or paint color was relatively cheap. I love the electric Cole &amp; Sons Palms wallpaper—it adds a touch of fun to an otherwise formal dining room. I also love the pop of color from the door to the powder room. We hated having the stained glass window facing a dull orange wall because it cast a weird orangey glow into the room. Rather than fight it, though, we decided to paint the door an amped-up version of that wall to tie the colors together in a fun way.</p>

They instead used that extra space to take advantage of the room’s length and install lower cabinets all the way to the window wall. To make it feel even bigger, they opted for one long wood shelf opposite the wall of upper cabinets.</span></p><h3>Clever idea: shallow cabinets save space</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37242 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Inwood kitchen renovation, remodel, after, design, construction" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandra and Michael overhauled their </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/sustainable-remodel-inwood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing galley kitchen layout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to add more cabinet and counter space. They chose narrow base cabinets (basically wall cabinets) to save the square footage without making it feel more cramped.</span></p><h3>Relocating a bulky fridge frees up valuable space</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23887 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />In Hari and Kaity’s galley kitchen the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hari-kaitys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refrigerator placement</a> minimized counter space and the surrounding walls made the whole space tight. They relocated it to a spot a few feet outside of the kitchen walls. A cutout in the wall at the entrance also helped free up space. Pro tip: if you’re unsure about taking down walls, moving your refrigerator can be an alternative to free up space while preserving the existing layout.</p><h3>A galley kitchen puts dead space to use</h3><p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="galley kitchen with blue walls and granite countertops" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-28402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten homeowner Rashmi had no interest in an open kitchen when it was time to renovate.

To save space, shallower 18” kitchen cabinets were installed on one side. Closer to the entry, a narrow eat-in bar that was an extension from the countertop in the kitchen fit two stools.

The ideal distance between the two walls is four to six feet, which helps to maximize efficiency and workflow. Homeowners with smaller kitchens–meaning less than 90 square feet–would benefit from a galley kitchen layout.</p></div>

					<div id="elementor-tab-content-2642" class="elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix" data-tab="2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="elementor-tab-title-2642"><p class="p1">There are several ways to make a galley kitchen’s hallway-like appearance look bigger. First, using built-in refrigerators and dishwashers–which are only 24 inches deep–creates a seamless, flush line between appliances and cabinets. This eliminates protruding handles or edges. Second, choose your color palette wisely. Light-colored cabinets, like white, gray, and agave, make small spaces look bigger, as do glossy, reflective surfaces. Third, talk to a contractor about adding a pass-through window. These open up the space and allow for guests to mingle while the hosts prepare food. Lastly, look at the overall placement of your cabinets and appliances. Move bulky items, like fridges, away from the kitchen entrance as these can create visual barriers to the space and make it look smaller.</p></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Refinish a basement in Ardmore, Philadelphia</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When David and Wendy bought their 2,700-square-foot home in a Philadelphia suburb, one thing was for sure: the smelly, dated basement had to go. David completely demoed it with every intention of refinishing it after they moved in. Two years later and the basement had become a storage room instead of the recreational space for “serious TV watching,” an exercise area, and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/">bar</a> that he’d hoped to create. &#8220;I never got around to it, though, and finally hired someone through Sweeten,&#8221; David said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Ready to take on the unfinished basement once and for all, David <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27738" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> on Sweeten and chose this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a>. Since he’d already completed the demolition, they hit the ground running and kept his main goal of having a &#8220;dedicated space for TV-watching where [he] didn&#8217;t have to worry about large speakers ruining the decor.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, they had to determine how to best lay out the basement to meet his multi-purpose needs. A cousin who owns the interior design firm <a href="https://lkdesign.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LK Design</a> helped David figure out where to position the bar, fitness equipment, and the entertainment seating. Coming down the stairs from the main floor, the exercise area was set up directly to the right and away from the main living space. The bar and mini kitchen open conveniently to the seating area for easy access. Low ductwork presented a great spot to place the cabinetry and sink, and to maximize headspace as much as possible, they placed the bar directly under an exposed steel beam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for finishing touches, they outfitted the theater with plush carpeting for optimal comfort. For the remainder of the flooring, David decided on more durable (plus pet- and kid-friendly!) vinyl plank. The kitchen and bar got a luxe touch with granite <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a>, gray cabinets, and chrome hardware.<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-35322 noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-35316 noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-area-granite-countertop" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48564 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05.jpg" alt="Kitchen area with sink under grantite countertop and gray cabinetry after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Overall the biggest challenge (aside from determining the layout) was getting the bar sink installed below the sewer line. Fortunately, a plumber found a solution and installed a pump. Their Sweeten general contractor also provided invaluable assistance getting a full-size refrigerator down the narrow staircase, not to mention handling a few issues with vendors and navigating delays. &#8220;We had gas lines in the way of the ceiling, and he had a plumber who was able to reroute the lines in a very cost-effective way. Previous plumbers I had found only suggested much more expensive solutions,&#8221; David said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thinking ahead, they also prepared for possible wiring needs down the line and “future-proofed” throughout the basement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So how does the family feel about their new hangout space? &#8220;Comfortable and relaxed,&#8221; David said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="low-white-ceiling-blue-walls" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48569 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10.jpg" alt="Low white ceiling with blue walls in the entertainment room and fitness equipment after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: David and the contractor installed built-in cabinets in the corners of the entertaining area to hide the gas meters.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Carpeting: <a href="https://www.mohawkflooring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohawk</a>. Lifeproof vinyl plank flooring: <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbzjz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>. Cabinets, cabinet fronts, faucet: <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ikea</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-basement-turns-into-family-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cristiana and her husband</a> took advantage of valuable square footage and turned their basement into a multi-purpose space complete with a family room, wine storage, and laundry area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Clinton Hill home gains flexible space with sliding doors</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33864 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, open shelving, bar" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two decades ago, native New Yorkers Margery and Jim Fields worked in Manhattan and lived just outside the city. In 1996, the family relocated to Philadelphia when Jim was transferred for a job. The couple always had a special place in their hearts for New York, and when their kids grew up, they decided it was the right time to return.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33866 size-chrono" title="Margery and Jim" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-16-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NYC-Skyline.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34597 size-chrono" title="view" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NYC-Skyline-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34566 size-chrono" title="floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Floorplan-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they began their search for an NYC home, they wanted something a bit unique. They looked at many listings, but it was the view from their apartment at the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a> (a Brooklyn complex near and dear to us here at Sweeten, after renovating so many homes there!) that sold them on the one-bedroom place they ended up purchasing. They loved the sweeping view of Manhattan—the island that drew them back to the five boroughs.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33868 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-04-723x933.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33875 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-07-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33867 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, subway tile, spot lighting, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment itself was a different story. It hadn’t been updated in 40 years and had been chopped up with too many walls. Despite this, they decided that the incredible views were worth the trade-off of having to renovate. After a remodeling of their Philadelphia kitchen several years ago, they had a good idea of a wishlist for their next project. They wisely decided to live in the space for six months before starting the design process to get a feel for how they would use it—and to understand the light&#8217;s effect in the apartment at various times of the day. They heard about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, from their neighbors, and it kept coming up in conversation. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose this Sweeten contractor</a>, who had previously done several projects in the Clinton Hill Co-ops.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34564 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-05-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33869 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-05a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34108 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-05a-723x484.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, subway tile, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="484" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once discussions got underway, they made some decisions with the help of their Sweeten contractor; prior work in the building meant he knew what was behind the walls and what to anticipate, so was able to guide Margery and Jim on what actions would need to come next in the process. He knew the bathroom ceiling was a drop ceiling and would be able to install the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotlighting</a> they wanted. Their contractor was also familiar with the building&#8217;s wiring and informed them it would not support an induction cooktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple’s design vision was an industrial-yet-modern aesthetic. They wanted to take down the walls boxing in the kitchen and allow as much light into the space as possible. The full scope included a new kitchen and bath as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33873 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-04-723x933.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33872 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, hardwood floors, sliding door, french door, open shelving, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, Margery and Jim planned to convert the dining nook beside the kitchen into a second bedroom but ultimately decided on a flex-space solution made possible by sliding doors. When they didn’t need the second bedroom, the doors could remain open to take full advantage of the two large windows in the nook. The contractor created a custom solution by fusing two estate-sale-find French doors that Margery and Jim had found to make a sliding pocket door. The renovated nook is now a seating area that can be closed off from the living room to create a guest sleeping area that feels like a “studio within the apartment,” explained Margery. It is also a cozy spot for guests to perch when the pair entertain and are preparing food in the kitchen. (Given that Jim has seven brothers who are all married, they definitely need the seating for guests!)</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-03.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33876 mb-0 size-chrono" title="long-blue-kitchen-cabinet-peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-03.gif" alt="long blue kitchen cabinet with knob and white kitchen peninsula with cabinets after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the kitchen revamp, Jim and Margery decided on dark gray cabinets paired with a light quartz countertop and glass subway tile. The contractor suggested a full-length <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pantry</a> next to the refrigerator on the wall separating the kitchen from the living room, providing unexpected bonus storage. On the other side of the fridge, open shelving is built onto a mirrored backsplash for maximum light reflection into the kitchen. Corner shelving was added, with a Lazy Susan to maximize under-counter space leaving enough room for a full-size dishwasher.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33877 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, hardwood floors, subway tile, stainless steel appliances, sliding door, spot lighting" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-14.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33878 mb-0 size-chrono" title="gray-blue-kitchen-cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-14.gif" alt="gray blue kitchen cabinet with oven and a white door after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple intended to add a kitchen island at first. But when they saw how open the space felt without it, they chose to leave it as is. Similarly, the original design called for stainless steel shelving to be added to the back wall above the sink but decided to leave it open for an airier feel overhead.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Margery and Jim were able to make use of another estate sale find—the black large-format tiles, which cost a dollar a piece. They paired those tiles with an unusual bronze <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penny tile</a> Margery had once seen and admired in a restaurant. A cast-iron tub was swapped out for a vinyl one that allowed the contractor to bring the wall tile around the front to tie the space together. Modern Brizo fixtures helped to finish the clean, streamlined look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that their project is complete, Margery and Jim have a few words of wisdom for would-be renovators. They stress the importance of selecting the right contractor—one with whom you can have a good “communication cadence,” said Margery. “We would text or talk to our contractor multiple times a week, or multiple times a day as things came up. That ability to instantly communicate would keep things from being delayed or misinterpreted.” They love the openness of the new layout, &#8220;while keeping some separation between the kitchen and main living space,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;We&#8217;re glad we didn&#8217;t take out the bar/pantry wall.&#8221; Check out their Behind-The-Reno video below:</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28193 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Sarah and Craig" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-01-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation Queens" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sarah and Craig, along with their two shelter pets, Willie (the cat) and Quincy (the dog), had lived in a rather tiny 700-square-foot Manhattan apartment for four years. When they moved into a modern Long Island City condo in 2013, the 1,160-square-foot one-bedroom felt like the Great Plains. “Initially, we were so thrilled to have so much space that we didn’t think about improving it,” said Sarah. Over time, ideas for possible tweaks, refinements, and overall improvements began jumping out at them. Among the wish list: creating a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-is-a-legal-bedroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second bedroom</a>, revamping the bathrooms, and harnessing the potential of a few pockets of what seemed like dead space. But the thing that ultimately motivated Sarah and Craig (particularly Craig) was the disproportionately small kitchen sink—a big, white farmhouse sink they had their eye on seemed a much better fit for their large apartment. “We like to joke that our entire renovation started with the kitchen sink,” said Sarah.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/15319" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted general contractors, to locate a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/truth-design-build-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design-build firm</a>. Rather than get design help from a general contractor or hire a designer and a contractor separately, a design-build firm brings it all together in one organization. “Many contractors claim to offer this when they are really loose associations of separate companies,” said Sarah. “<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Sweeten contractors</a> were a one-stop shop—a true design-build firm under one roof.” The aesthetic Sarah and Craig wanted was what they coined “industrial eclectic.” The goal: preserve the industrial history of Long Island City while adding some of the couple’s own rustic taste.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen’s dark cabinetry was swapped out for a bright white that, of course, complemented that big, white farmhouse sink. In order to make the kitchen and living room into two distinct areas, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> was extended into something of a casual dining area that was ideal for pre-dinner drinks or a meal for a low-key evening at home. Fortunately for this couple, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer/dryer unit</a> already existed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sarah and Craig’s Sweeten contractors really excelled when it came to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximizing storage space</a> in the kitchen. Their designer installed sliding shelves in the lower kitchen counters “that slide out so we can easily access our pots and pans.” New custom cabinets were also added to the inside of the now-larger kitchen island. Their contractor team also designed and built a tall cabinet separate from the kitchen that became a home for spices along with the couple’s miniature herb garden. One of the highlights of the new design is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar area</a>. A small nook of dead space fit a wine fridge perfectly, while the wooden carving on the shelf above the racks of wine and beer naturally reads “Cheers.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Dividing the large living room into a second bedroom and living area was one of the improvements the couple envisioned. They placed the additional room where they did because of the rectangular shape but didn’t want to block the natural light coming in from the bank of windows. Sliding doors were their solution and their Sweeten contractor went to work designing a custom set. Not only were they able to increase storage space in the bathrooms and kitchen, other areas became additional places to stow stuff. A small closet was added to a newly minted second bedroom, including enough space for a double bike rack, and the master bedroom welcomed a new closet. “Before the project, we were constantly looking for places to stash our clutter,” said Sarah. “Now, everything has a home.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On to the two bathrooms. The original style was a little bland for the couple’s taste, so they updated with new tiles and fixtures. Rather than the original off-white tiles, they chose a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bold pattern</a> that was more fun. The Steampunk-style lights surrounding the mirrors in either bathroom added a rustic feel to the space, as did the distressed finish of the vanities. The toilets became a momentary problem. A rear-outlet toilet was needed because of the plumbing in their building. This meant a smaller selection to choose from. However, the couple’s contractor “searched tirelessly, high and low, to find a rear-outlet toilet that would work in our space and fit our look,” said Sarah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, Sarah and Craig found that their Sweeten contractors “struck a perfect balance between owning the project and involving us in the creative decision-making process,” said Sarah. &#8220;Everything went smoothly once we were connected with our contractor, so we&#8217;re happy to report we never had to engage the Sweeten client services team!&#8221; A slight hiccup developed when an exterior wall issue was spotted, holding up the project. However, the team worked hard to get back on track and for the entire renovation, the couple was able to rent a studio apartment from someone else in their building. All in all, the renovation took four months. “Without that trust [in our Sweeten&#8217;s], the experience would have been much more stressful,” said Sarah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Last year, Lindsay and Tim bought their first home together<i>—</i>a sprawling two-bedroom apartment on Central Park West. The couple—a medical student and financial analyst, respectively—saw the potential to create an incredible home for themselves, but had a list of renovation items to tackle first. With Sweeten&#8217;s help, they created a classic but thoroughly contemporary apartment with room to grow. By updating their existing kitchen and baths, they carved out new spaces for living, working, and entertaining. Read on for how they reconfigured walls to add an expanded office, a half bath, </i><em>AND bonus storage space </em><i>to their prewar apartment! </i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23151 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Upper West Side homeowner Tim Laurie</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After purchasing our first apartment together in June of 2016, my wife, Lindsay, and I decided to take on a co-op renovation in order to make it our perfect living space. We were attracted to the location and design of the 1929 Art Deco building on Central Park West, but the interior of the apartment left a lot to be desired. The 1,500-square-foot home offered a very spacious feel, with nine-foot ceilings and light coming through windows on three sides of the apartment. The layout, however, was dated and not very efficient. The “before” layout consisted of a cramped corner kitchen, large but divided living and dining spaces both of which had duplicate doorways on both sides, old en-suite bathrooms, and a dark walk-in closet converted to a cavernous office space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23304 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Before-and-After-Floorplans.001-720x540.jpeg" alt="Before and After Floorplans.001" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23305 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Before-and-After-Floorplans.002-720x540.jpeg" alt="Before and After Floorplans.002" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When planning the new layout, first and foremost, our renovation needed to address the practical features that were lacking. Specifically, we wanted: 1) a toilet that didn&#8217;t require guests to venture on an embarrassing trek through a bedroom in order to get to an en-suite bathroom; 2) more usable space, such as a den or optional third bedroom; 3) a washer and dryer in the apartment; and 4) a larger, but not galley-like, kitchen. With the help of Sweeten, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/10047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> and went with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contractor</a> that stood out as most reliable, reassuring, and within our cost estimate. We initially interviewed five contractors for our project, and received three quotes. Our contractor was not the least nor the most expensive, but he offered to include the finishing touches on our apartment to ensure we got the most out of our renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23378 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Manhattan renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-2-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23154 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23156 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23157 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest change in the kitchen was changing the entrance from a narrow doorway to a wide foyer and pass-through, allowing us to add a bar area, more counter space, and plenty of light. Our contractor helped us with the kitchen layout and where to place the washer/dryer so it connected to our water lines. We went with stainless steel Frigidaire appliances, adding a separate bar fridge under the counter to make up for a shallower built-in refrigerator that we chose. A stainless backsplash tile with white grout and slate gray floor tiles contrasts well with the white custom cabinets and brushed nickel handles throughout. We love the custom wine rack, glass cupboard, and bar shelf on one side of what used to be a duplicate doorway. A powder room—formerly small storage space—was also installed off the kitchen with double half doors, to take up less clearance space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23158 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23159 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of design, we wished to open up the main space by removing the mirrored french doors and a wall blocking the light between the living and dining rooms. For a modernized look, our plan included staining the hardwood floors, painting and papering the walls, and adding crown and floor molding. <span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">living room</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we removed the non-functional decorative plaster fireplace and the walls between the living and dining rooms to open up the main living space. A large dining room table from Pottery Barn (which nearly didn&#8217;t fit up the elevator) and chandelier sit between the bar and new office door. In this same area, we were able to build a third bedroom/den with french glass doors for light to shine through.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our en-suite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bathrooms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned out beautifully, with our master bath getting floor-to-ceiling tile in the shower and on the feature wall, as well as a custom-built vanity and top-mounted sink. The white, tan, and natural sand colors flow nicely into the main bedroom, which also got repainted. The guest en-suite bathroom is filled with clean white subway tiles and Carrara marble flooring, as well as an ebony vanity with matching Carrara countertop. Although the renovation progressed well from our standpoint, the contractors had their work cut out for them! They had to cut back old bathroom tiling and build new walls. We also had to replace old bathroom plumbing within the concrete deck floors, which was unexpected, but handled well by the subcontractors that our Sweeten contractor hired.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23307 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-15-723x1084.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-15" width="723" height="1084" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23308 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-16-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-16" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slightly expanded but cozy and carpeted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">office</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a bonus room for studying and work, accessible through the new matching french doors off the dining room, rather than from the bedroom hallway. The office neatly fits our double desk and two chairs, as well as a bookshelf. A new transom window in the hallway allows more light to shine through. </span>We were especially excited about a tweed Edinburgh gray wallpaper that we chose for the entrance foyer, which makes a big statement right when you enter the apartment. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least is the updated &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">garage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; where we leave the bikes, storage, and our cat&#8217;s litter box. This storage room was coated with a fresh coat of white paint and new gray tile as well, giving it a clean look despite its utilitarian purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Overall, we are very pleased with the renovation of our Central Park West co-op apartment. At the end, we decided to add extras along the way, which extended the project time frame by several weeks and stretched our budget slightly; however, our contractor did his best to complete these while not adding labor to the total bill. He was detail-oriented and very patient, despite a lengthy co-op approval process.</span><span class="s2"> The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team kept the work to a reasonable time frame of just over three months and were very understanding as we lived through the process.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">From open shelves to a liquor cabinet with a garage-style door, these storage ideas can transform your kitchen (or closet!) into a fabulous home bar</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" title="white kitchen-recessed-lights"  class="alignnone wp-image-22989 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg" alt="white kitchen with recessed lights and white cabinets along with white door and knob after renovation" width="723" height="481" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When friends come over, the first thing you do is offer them a glass of wine. That means locating the bottle of wine before heading to where the glasses are usually stored. Finally, you root through the silverware and odds-and-ends drawers until you triumphantly unearth the corkscrew. Sound familiar? Rather than storing bar essentials around the kitchen, these Sweeten homeowners opted for home bar solutions to store everything from glasses to bottles of wine, liquor, cocktail shakers, and more. Plus, homeowners Yi Tyng and Maxime even transformed a closet located directly across from their kitchen into a wine bar (and it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/the-closet-as-workspace-bedroom-or-bar.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured in <em>The New York Times</em></a>). We’ll drink to that!</span></p>
<h3>Got an empty shelf niche? Add home bar hardware to keep stemware closeby</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22998 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-04" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/holly-kitchen-bath-renovation-greenwich-village/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holly and Christian’s</a> kitchen in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This clever use of niche shelf space is an excellent way to store wine, cocktail, and champagne glasses so that they can dry quickly and always be within reach for a celebratory toast.</span></p>
<h3>Floating shelves showcase stemware and spirits</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22996 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan and Mike’s</a> kitchen in Hell’s Kitchen, Manhattan.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Balancing a run of lower cabinets, a few open shelves act as a home bar dedicated to glassware and bar favorites make it easy to whip up drinks for company. And why not make it a home for cookbooks and cocktail recipes, too?</span></p>
<h3>Using slivers of cabinet space for bottle storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LKR_2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22990 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LKR_2-723x1089.jpg" alt="LKR_2" width="723" height="1089" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisa’s</a> kitchen in Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you have wine, one popular way to store the bottles is on their side so that the corks don’t dry out and let air in. A custom nook with grooved edges is the perfect solution.</span></p>
<h3>Stacking shelves above a wine fridge creates a home bar nook</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23118 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22" width="723" height="482" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frans and Dalal&#8217;s</a> studio kitchen in Gramercy Park, Manhattan.</p>
<p class="p1">Every inch in a studio apartment should be utilized to its full potential. By using the placement of the wine fridge as the base for a custom bar, these homeowners were able to add a countertop and shelving to store their home bar essentials and glassware in one easy-to-locate spot.</p>
<h3 class="p1">A cupboard under the stairs becomes space for spirits<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN-Wine-Bar.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23074 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN-Wine-Bar-723x964.jpg" alt="SWEETEN-Wine-Bar" width="723" height="964" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yi Tyng and Maxime&#8217;s</a> wine bar closet on the Upper West Side, Manhattan.</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">This closet, located under the stairs and directly across from the homeowners&#8217; galley kitchen, was transformed into a wine (and espresso) bar complete with open shelving, a wine fridge, and a counter with bar stools. The space also doubles as a breakfast nook.</p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">A garage-style door cleverly conceals cocktail-making gear<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" title="white kitchen-recessed-lights"  class="alignnone wp-image-22989 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg" alt="white kitchen with recessed lights and white cabinets along with white door and knob after renovation" width="723" height="481" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/katie-elliots-williamsburg-townhouse-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katie and Elliot’s</a> kitchen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have a larger collection, a custom bar cabinet with shelving for glassware and bottles can keep everything neatly organized. This one also boasts a sliding garage-style door so you can choose whether or not to display the goods based on your mood.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23956 mb-0 size-chrono" title="small kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-723x482.jpg" alt="small kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Editor&#8217;s Note: This post, which originally ran July 2015, shows that smart storage never gets old. Here&#8217;s a look into what happens when Manhattanites make bold changes in a small kitchen—like taking down kitchen walls! This Hell&#8217;s Kitchen renovation would have been stylish even if it had stayed within its original dimensions, but taking a wall down was the first step in making the space virtually unrecognizable. Scroll on down for the play by play on this ambitious Manhattan kitchen renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dan and Mike moved into this one bedroom, one bathroom co-op in Manhattan&#8217;s storied Piano Factory building in 2013. The building, converted from a 19th century warehouse that once served as the manufacturing site for the inner workings of pianos, is an industrial brick building in Hell&#8217;s Kitchen with a beautiful Romanesque entry and a graceful courtyard. Dan and Mike loved the building&#8217;s history and architecture, but found themselves in an apartment constructed in the grand tradition of many 1980s co-op conversions: boxy rooms, segmented living spaces, a dated pass-through in the wall that sectioned off the small kitchen from the living area, and kitchen finishes that were unchanged from the apartment&#8217;s first owner. Worse still, the kitchen&#8217;s sizable window was hidden in the back of the room, blocking light and limiting the impact that a windowed kitchen should have.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dan, a technology scout for a chemical company, and Mike, who works in finance for a construction company, liked the layout and the slightly retro feel of the original kitchen but envisioned opening up the room, making it part of the larger living area, and finding creative storage ideas to make the space work harder and smarter for them. Armed with an architect&#8217;s drawing, Dan and Mike <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2420" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project on Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, to take down the wall, gut the kitchen, and extend the counters and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinetry</a>. They were introduced to their Sweeten contractor to handle the demolition and full re-build.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Though they loved the industrial past of the building, Dan and Mike didn&#8217;t want to go too far with an industrial modern aesthetic. They set out to create an updated look balanced by raw and unfinished accents to fill the open plan room, and played with different natural and synthetic wood finishes to maintain a measure of warmth and masculinity amid the clean lines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Demolishing the wall had an enormous impact on the space, and Dan and Mike took the newfound breathing room even further by removing the upper line of cabinets altogether and replacing the original base laminates with a full set of IKEA cabinets and drawers, which their Sweeten contractor installed with custom doors and hardware from <a href="https://www.semihandmade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semihandmade</a>. The new, more functional base cabinets gave the couple enough storage capacity to go minimal on top—Dan found salvaged Douglas Fir pieces and created open floating shelves in a shop in Greenpoint. This move allows the open kitchen to flow more seamlessly into the living room, and significantly reduced visual heft through to the kitchen&#8217;s window.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23957 size-chrono" title="small kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="small kitchen" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23958 size-chrono" title="small kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="small kitchen" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23959 size-chrono" title="small kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="small kitchen" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23960 mb-0 size-chrono" title="small kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="small kitchen" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In their search for a tougher and more durable alternative to concrete countertops that <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ways-care-renovated-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wouldn&#8217;t stain easily</a>, Dan and Mike found <a href="https://www.dekton.com/usa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dekton</a>, an ultra-compacted blend of raw materials that Dan reports is virtually impenetrable. Dan couldn&#8217;t help but reveal his expertise as a tech scout for a chemical company when he explained that the material was also attractive because its raw materials are free of synthetic resins that are often used in construction. Dan and Mike loved the look of a waterfall counter and worked with their Sweeten contractor to create the effect so that the kitchen entry was marked and separated visually by the countertop extension of the cabinet peninsula.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To contrast with the striated cabinetry and porcelain <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor tiles</a> finished with an end-cut wood grain look, the couple selected a classic white subway tile and neutral gray grout to line the walls from floor to ceiling, and added a gray and black mosaic tile accent to meet the height of the kitchen&#8217;s window.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their Sweeten contractor helped to complete the transformation by stealing twelve inches of brand new pull-out pantry space from a walk-in closet adjacent to the kitchen, and adding an ultra-minimal storage rack for pots and pans. Dan and Mike chose stainless steel appliances throughout and especially love the 30 inch Wolf range with its signature red knobs, as well as the unconventionally tall Summit fridge—a great find for tight kitchens.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;In some ways, we bit off more than we could chew. Sweeten introduced us to a contractor who was really easy to work with, flexible about our plans, and helpful with things that were uncertain or unexpectedly discovered behind walls<b>,</b>&#8221; says Dan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So many thanks to Dan and Mike for this eye-opening tour of their spacious little-kitchen-that-could!</p>

<p>Custom cabinet doors add a unique touch and are a great way to personalize pre-fabricated cabinets. Becky and Sarah chose a similar style for their cabinets, creating a striking white-on-wood contrast in their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/becky-kitchen-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen renovation</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday <a href="https://sweeten.com/about">Jean</a>, Becky and I visited <a href="https://www.bklyndesigns.com/">Bklyn Designs</a>, the annual showcase at St. Ann&#8217;s Warehouse for local designers and craftspeople. There were upholsterers, woodworkers, carpet makers, and metalsmiths there, all showing off the beautiful things they produced in their Brooklyn studios.</p>
<p>Two rising furniture-makers with very different sensibilities made a big impression.</p>
<p><a href="https://colleenanderic.com/">Colleen and Eric</a> design lovely, playful home furnishings inspired by far-fetched ideas. Small brass rivets are recessed into the dark wood top of the &#8220;Northstar Table&#8221; like stars in the constellation. If you locate the northstar and press down on it, a secret side drawer slides open. It&#8217;s the perfect place to stash a diary, jewelry, or contraband.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1306/4609972374_d29e761b2b.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC NIGHTSTAR TABLE" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3580/4609972472_cb9653e2ff.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC NIGHTSTAR TABLE DETAIL" /></p>
<p>Colleen and Eric&#8217;s &#8220;Hold on Tight Bookshelf&#8221; takes unlikely inspiration from the image of books toppling sideways off an open shelf. This simple maple shelf is capped at one end and has a brightly-colored, sliding metal stop at the other. The toy-like mechanism is a pretty accent and also a lot of fun. Becky couldn&#8217;t stop playing with the display model and Jean and I finally had to drag her away.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1188/4609972250_b3539e1cfa.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC HOLDONTIGHT" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3538/4609972550_fcf110dd4a.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC HOLDONTIGHT DETAIL" /></p>
<p>Colleen and Eric also make accessories like tote bags and keychains. Their product lines are sure to expand further as they&#8217;re struck by new ideas. It &#8216;ll be fun to see what they&#8217;ve come up with at next year&#8217;s fair.</p>
<p>In contrast, the pieces from Kai-Wei Hsu&#8217;s shop <a href="https://www.kwhfurniture.com/">KWH Furniture</a> take inspiration from the elemental qualities of the woods that they&#8217;re made from. The furniture in the new &#8220;Vice&#8221; line doesn&#8217;t shout out for attention. Each piece has a clear, modern sensibility and yet is so restrained so that it wouldn&#8217;t feel out of a place in a traditional interior.</p>
<p>The elegant &#8220;Bar Cart&#8221; is made from white oak with a cerused finish. The first thing you&#8217;re drawn to is the fine grain and stain of the wood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3587/4609973164_ba67d01791.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART" /></p>
<p>Then, as you lean in closer, you understand the exquisite workmanship of the piece. The outer corners of the frame are held together with wood splices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1404/4609972720_04fb2bdf7e.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART DETAIL 01" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4019/4609973430_5fff0ce9ab.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART DETAIL 02" /></p>
<p>The similarly elegant &#8220;Vanity Table&#8221; is made from black walnut with an oil finish. Its proportions are perfectly balanced. The first think that strikes you is the sumptuous finish in the wood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1317/4609363631_a18322cabf.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY" /></p>
<p>Then when you move in closer, as you&#8217;re bound to do, you see how subtly and precisely the drawers are fitted.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1274/4609363865_1d49899a26.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY DETAIL 03" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3332/4609363461_74f96200a4.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY DETAIL 02" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how Kai-Wei&#8217;s designs evolve as he explores new materials and details. Whatever direction the pieces take, I&#8217;m certain they&#8217;ll all have the same immaculate craftsmanship.</p>
