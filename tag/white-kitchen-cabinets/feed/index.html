<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>A ranch-style Georgia home with appeal</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We bought this 1958 home in Atlanta’s Buckhead section with plans to renovate right away. Nothing was wrong, per se, but we knew we wanted to remodel. The plan was to improve the layout and exterior façade and update the kitchen and bathrooms. A big project would also turn the primary bedroom into a true master suite.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21.jpg" alt="Den with fireplace, couches, chairs, grand piano, and hanging fan" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52190" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are Jenna and Hagan, now parents to two daughters: Clay, 2, and Sloan, 7 months. Henry, our dog, lives here, too. When we found the house, we were still expecting our second child and I was working from home due to the pandemic. More space and some rooms to relax in were all we could think about.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>A mid-century remodel focused on good bones with potential</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Our ranch-style home, in the Chastain Park neighborhood, comprises 3,000 square feet. It has a backyard with mature trees, and the house benefits from pretty views and lots of natural light. The interior was traditionally styled, and we liked it. We felt, however, that we could make it work better for our family, and set out to do that. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and the team quickly sourced four quality contractors for us to consider. We soon <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6751#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a general contractor</a> who inspired our confidence. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23.jpg" alt="A view of the white painted brick fireplace from behind the tan couch" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52192" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22.jpg" alt="The grand piano in the renovated den with a large plant" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52191" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We brought floorplans to our meetings, as layout changes were the most challenging part of the project. Our house had a lot of storage space that we saw a potential to put to better use. These would include the bedroom areas as well as more useful spaces for the kitchen area.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the den, our contractor removed a large built-in shelf that had started to separate from the wall. We also painted this room and stained the floor dark brown.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20.jpg" alt="View into the two doors to the living areas from the entryway" width="1000" height="1545" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52189" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20-194x300.jpg 194w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20-583x900.jpg 583w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<span class="s1">&#8220;The contractor replaced the windows top to bottom to improve insulation. We could see early signs of rotting wood in the old windows.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A new bay window brightens the kitchen</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The plan for the kitchen included putting in a bay window in the existing breakfast nook and installing Dolomite marble countertops. We ordered a new kitchen sink and added a subway tile backsplash. We kept the existing cabinets, switching out the knobs for a fast refresh. To increase function in this section of the house, we turned to old closets. Opening up the boxed-in space of the four lining the back hallway made space for a butler’s pantry with a second fridge. We also built a laundry room in this area in a follow-up to the larger renovation. </span></p>

<h3>Transforming closets for a master suite</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the back of the house, closets (again) and one of the offices gave their square footage to enlarge our master suite and another bedroom. For the master suite, we imagined a large, open bedroom area looking out into the backyard. We would also add a walk-in closet, a big bathroom, and a powder room. The remap worked brilliantly. An existing door was repurposed as a sliding barn door and leads to our master walk-in closet. The contractor built a secret door at its back that lets us quickly get to the kids’ bedrooms during the night. It has come in handy!</span></p>

<h3 class="p4">Three bathrooms with new tile</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bathroom renovations came next. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/how-to-save-on-home-remodeling-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We did them economically</a>—as in almost simultaneously. Each bath got new tile, though we retained usable fixtures and hardware</span><span class="s1"> where we could. At one point, we had three bathrooms torn up. The one in use had a shower only, and our two-year-old was terrified of showers! We were pleased when the child’s bathroom, replete with new tub and penny tile floor, was finished—not to mention the other three. Our beautiful master bath, with a freestanding fluted bathtub, a glass-walled shower, and double sinks got the full marble treatment. The color palette was a mix of gray and white, including sleek large-sheet floor tiles</span><span class="s1">. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15.jpg" alt="Bathroom with light blue walls, white floors, white shower curtain, and decorative mirror" width="1000" height="668" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52186" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Whole-house improvements for curb appeal</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Much of the house had hardwood flooring in need of refinishing. From the bedrooms to the living room, den, foyer, and kitchen, the contractors sanded and stained them. In another global redo, the contractor replaced the windows top to bottom to improve insulation. We could see early signs of rotting wood in the old windows. The new kitchen bay window </span><span class="s1">looks great from the inside and <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/curb-appeal-goes-a-long-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhances the home’s curb appeal</a>.

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A Sweeten general contractor to count on</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Through it all, our Sweeten contractor was reliable and competent. He was diligent with the permitting process, a delay-ridden challenge during Covid. (Key takeaway: Be 100 percent sure you need a permit and factor it into your timeline!) Our contractor was transparent on costs, and his efforts resulted in a pleasing final product.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It’s been a feat, but finally, we feel settled. Jenna and I waited so long for our master suite—it feels magical to have our own space. The girls, and Henry the dog, are happy. We are home.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Homeowners:</strong> A young couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27287#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their Bed-Stuy remodel</a> on Sweeten to revitalize their townhouse</li>
<li><strong>Where:</strong> Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> Outfit their 1,500-square-foot Bed-Stuy home with a new kitchen, bath, and open-concept living area</li>
<li><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4715#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Sweeten&#8217;s role:</strong> <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reimagining the Bed-Stuy home for family life</h3>
<p>This Bedford-Stuyvesant home once belonged to the homeowner&#8217;s grandmother. The home came with fond memories of her childhood, so she happily inherited it. However, as the townhouse had been built in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, it needed a lot of work. She would remodel it to accommodate the needs of her own family. They planned for an open concept layout, with open sightlines to keep the family together while in different rooms. To modernize the spaces, they&#8217;d outfit their dream kitchen and bathroom with new, state-of-the-art appliances and finishes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2.jpg" alt="Exterior of the Bed-Stuy home with front yard and metal gate" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52273" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>She turned to Sweeten to find a contractor she&#8217;d be comfortable with handling this important renovation. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27287#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4715#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found the right contractor</a> with experience in old-home remodels. They signed the contract and the work began!</p>
<h3>Necessary behind-the-wall updates</h3>
<p>First, fixing the systems behind the walls had to be done to support updated materials and appliances. The plumbing had corroded and was located in inefficient places. The electrical also needed to be upgraded. Their Sweeten contractor found improperly connected wires in the ceiling, which posed a fire hazard. The subfloor had to be ripped out, and the joists had to be reinforced to keep the kitchen floor from collapsing.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="white-and-gray-kitchen-cabinet-with-island" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-07.jpg" alt="White and gray kitchen cabinets with kitchen island after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-51527 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27287-Teresa-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>All this work made the kitchen functional and safe. The design aesthetic came next. The homeowner chose a contemporary combination of white cabinets along the kitchen perimeter, and gray base cabinets for the island. The owners selected quartz countertops for the work surface, due to their <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/popular-types-of-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reasonable price point and durability</a>. The island became the focal point of the room, which also featured deliberate pops of color, like the must-have bright red range. Other features, such as a gold-finish pot filler, pull-out storage cabinets, and a built-in wine rack, completed the look.</p>
<h3>New layout and features</h3>
<p>The rest of the Bed-Stuy home benefited from the remodel, too. Their contractor removed a wall between the kitchen and living area to open up the flow. They also installed new wood floors, along with all-new recessed lights, a closet, and a front door. Another addition: a new laundry room, which replaced an existing screened-in porch area. The contractor fully outfitted the laundry room—from reconstructing electrical, plumbing, and insulation to subflooring and venting.</p>

<h3>Rejuvenating the master bathroom</h3>
<p>Like the kitchen, the master bathroom would become her dream bathroom. As a mom, it would be her sanctuary. A standalone tub would give her the chance to unwind. The construction crew faced a challenge: nestling the tub into a tight niche without damaging or touching the walls. But the crew completed the task handily, with the result being an inviting clawfoot oasis, flanked on one end by a custom vanity. In a nod to wainscoting, the team <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-much-does-it-cost-to-tile-a-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installed the bathroom tile</a> halfway up the wall.</p>

<h3>Working with the right contractor</h3>
<p>For this nostalgic renovation, the homeowner saw and worked with her Sweeten contractor for months. Fortunately, she found the right partner who understood her vision. This partnership allowed them to communicate throughout the process and solve problems when issues arose. A solid working bond between the client and Sweeten contractor formed, so much so, when it looked like their renovation would not be done in time for Thanksgiving, their contractor invited them to celebrate with his family. Luckily, their new home is now ready to create brand new memories for years to come.</p>

<p>The dependable all-white kitchen color palette remains popular for the wide-ranging looks it brings to the kitchen. The clean slate of a single white hue brings visual calm when on its own. Add to that tile shape, pattern, and texture and you&#8217;ll start to see a personality emerge. It works as a supportive background when paired with gold hardware or dark wood for contrast. This classic neutral compliments modern, industrial, and every style in-between. Here, seven Sweeten kitchens show why white is the perennial choice.</p>

<h3><strong>A fresh start in an all-white kitchen</strong></h3>

<p>As new parents-to-be, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowners Tara and Brian were looking</a> for something more modern. They wanted to ditch their dated kitchen with a faulty layout. After finalizing the floor plan, the homeowners chose a simple white subway tile backsplash to ground the room. The clean tile became a cohesive backdrop for an exotic live edge walnut island countertop<span>—</span>a must-have for Tara. The dark shelves stand out and provide a pleasant contrast.</p>
<h3>A traditional kitchen goes modern</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="Sweeten kitchen with Semihandmade cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34317" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-07-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seven months of living in their first home,</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/a-white-kitchen-sized-just-right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marc and Steve decided it was</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> time to renovate their crowded, outdated kitchen, which was once dark and claustrophobic. The homeowners wanted their kitchen to feel open and bright. To achieve this, the duo installed sleek white cabinets and countertops. The window above the sink was swapped out for a larger window letting in more natural light. A black-and-white patterned floor added a graphic urban look.</span></p>
<h3>A warm, minimalist all-white kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Elie-Chau-Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38850" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Elie-Chau-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Elie-Chau-Kitchen-01-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Elie-Chau-Kitchen-01-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Elie-Chau-Kitchen-01-1-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manhattan homeowners</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/a-galley-kitchen-gets-in-line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elie and Matt wanted to remodel</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">their washed-out gallery kitchen. Custom-made<span style="color: #333333;"> white cabinets,</span> along with a white quartz countertop and backsplash moved them in a direction that was more in line with their taste. The pop of gold hardware and large-format gray tile flooring made the kitchen feel luxurious, yet crisp and simple. Their new all-white kitchen makes Elie and Matt feel at home in the open, welcoming space.</span></p>
<h3>A simple and current all-white kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="brick wall" width="800" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-02.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a kitchen that had gone through &#8220;a hodgepodge&#8221; of renovations,</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/washington-heights-kitchen-renovation-for-a-family/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah and Eddy decided they needed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a complete change and a unifying design. Their kitchen was dark and dated. The goal was to achieve the opposite. The subway tile backsplash, grouted with dark gray, contrasted well with the open wood shelves. Keeping within the clean white look, an arabesque-patterned tile behind the stove was a nice design surprise. A neutral-toned banquette also stands out against a newly-discovered brick wall.</span></p>
<h3>Let there be light</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-600x400.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" class="alignnone wp-image-20220" style="font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, sans-serif;" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>Two <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/white-walls-and-black-hardware-in-a-windowed-pre-war-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newlyweds in Manhattan</a> knew their kitchen was in need of an update before moving in. The kitchen had been worn, with dark clunky cabinets, while the dining room table made the kitchen feel cramped. After adding white cabinets with black knobs and a white quartz countertop, the space was revived. Extending the countertop underneath a window expanded the kitchen&#8217;s reach. The natural light shines through the new counter-to-ceiling windows, making the all-white kitchen gleam.</p>
<h3>Using architecture to add texture</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-loft-in-a-former-silk-warehouse-gets-a-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29280" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-loft-in-a-former-silk-warehouse-gets-a-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara and Ryan found their kitchen</a> to be functional, yet dark and musty. There was definitely room for improvement! Working around a column in the middle of the room, the couple was able to find a layout they liked. They achieved this by moving the kitchen island<span style="color: #333333;"> </span>slightly to create more room. The show-stopping feature of the room is its now dazzling white appearance. A once dated and crowded kitchen was now open and bright.</p>
<h3>All-white, with floor-to-ceiling storage</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg" alt="kitchen, kitchen island, Brooklyn kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44167" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nadia and Stephen planned to be</span></a> avid home chefs in their multigenerational townhome. But with their L-shaped kitchen, counter-space and storage were lacking, they needed some updates. The kitchen was moved to one side which made space to include an island, wraparound pantry, and dining room table. The all-white cabinets with no hardware added to the modern and streamlined look of the new bright and spacious family kitchen.<del></del></p>

<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog04-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29586 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog01-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog01-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h3>
<h3>Wear-and-tear of a well-used kitchen shows</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 23 years since Susan and Carl bought a one-bedroom East Village co-op, they&#8217;ve made a lot of changes. “The history is long in this space,” said Susan, including withstanding 16 years of kids and dogs. She isn’t exaggerating. This couple bought the neighboring studio apartment in 1997, bumping up their square footage to 1,400. They hired someone to do the bare minimum to connect the two apartments and did everything else themselves. A few years later, while an “inept” contractor did a poor job of fixing up the bathroom, the couple went on to do a DIY job with the kitchen. A leaky dishwasher eventually ruined the flooring.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With low interest rates, they decided to refinance their mortgage and renovate, which brings this story to the present day. Despite those DIY fixes, the kitchen wasn’t at its full potential. A dropped ceiling in certain areas eliminated what could be very useful storage space. The recessed canned lights hanging from the ceiling also made the kitchen feel small. Even with a cutout in the wall toward the living room, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/entertaining-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">layout didn&#8217;t suit entertaining</a>. “Whenever we had company,” said Susan, “everyone would squeeze into the end of the kitchen while I cooked and doled out snacks.”</p>
<h3>Finding the right expertise to get the job done</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the disaster of the bathroom contractor etched in their minds, Susan and Carl promised themselves to scrutinize the next person they worked with. They found Sweeten and posted their project, a choice that paid off many times over. For example, they discovered a beam that they feared would force them to shorten the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets and give up storage space</a>. But the Sweeten contractor they chose “knew exactly how to notch out the back of the taller cabinets to accommodate the beam,” said Susan.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29532 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog08.jpg" alt="nyc kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple spent hours on Pinterest and decided against uniformity in the long, narrow space, opting for family- and pet-friendly materials and layout instead. “We wanted to eliminate the bowling alley feel,” she said. This was achieved by mixing cabinets and shelves, as well as glass and solid doors, and horizontal and vertical lines. Moving the window gate from the inside to outside was another simple fix that made a big difference. That change now enables them to open the bottom half of the gate. They opted for a painted backsplash rather than tile. “It leaves open the possibility of changing colors when you get tired of it,” she said.</p>
<h3>Lessons learned from this East Village renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The job went smoothly with no issues with her contractor—even though the &#8220;construction dust was hard to live with&#8221;—the couple still has tips for other renovators: 1. Triple your <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-kitchen-renovation-take-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timeline estimate</a> to get a realistic sense of how long a renovation will take, and 2. When your kitchen is out of order, there’s a lot you can do in a slow cooker and rice cooker, including pasta!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog05-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29590 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog05-1.jpg" alt="nyc kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog05-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog05-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog07-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29592 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog07-1.jpg" alt="nyc kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog07-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog07-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog07-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: This East Village renovation was full of pleasant surprises along the way. When their Sweeten contractor ripped out the dropped ceiling, Susan and Carl had expected to find something that would slow the project down. Instead, no wires, pipes or anything structural was found inside. “Compared to any other [renovation] jobs, nothing significant held us back with this one,” said Susan.</p>

<h3>Before: Renovate an outdated Brooklyn kitchen</h3>
<p>Longtime renters Marc and Steve dreamed of having a place of their own. Their search for a one-bedroom in Brooklyn eventually led them to an unexpected choice: a co-op or house? The townhouse, they discovered, was a short commute (only two express train stops) from Manhattan. It would provide more space than a one-bedroom apartment and not have the maintenance fees that go with living in a co-op. After purchasing their new home, they lived in it for seven months before turning their attention to the kitchen.</p>
<p>“It was perhaps the most outdated room and we knew it needed a major renovation,” Marc said. The existing cabinets were grimy and had broken doors. Some were so high up that they were almost unusable. The countertops had seen better days. The too-big appliances—combined with a low drop ceiling—made it feel like the walls were closing in on the already small space.</p>

<h3>After: Creating the &#8220;must-haves&#8221; list and choosing the contractor</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a list of must-haves that included a full-size dishwasher and additional storage space, Marc and Steve set out to plan a renovation. “Before Sweeten, we weren&#8217;t sure how to find a contractor we could trust,” Marc said. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Posting his project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> led him to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his general contractor</a>. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After reading through great reviews and discussing the contractor&#8217;s past work with Sweeten, he felt confident he was making the right choice and accepted his contractor&#8217;s bid.</p>
<p><a href="http://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46407" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png" alt="Get Matched With Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fans of the classic, black-and-white New York kitchen, the couple aimed to create a bright space with a clean look, layering plenty of white to make the space feel bigger. “The kitchen needed to be truly functional and not just pretty,” Marc said. As for the design, “we landed on something like ‘a traditional white kitchen goes modern.&#8217;” With a contractor on board, they were finally on their way to the modern black and white kitchen renovation of their dreams.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48203 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Marc-Floor-1.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>Planning and ordering kitchen cabinets</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The need to demo the entire space meant that measuring would have to wait and the new cabinets—which usually require some lead time—couldn’t be ordered before work began. The couple decided on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA cabinets</a> and Semihandmade doors because they would arrive sooner than a fully customized set (although Marc noted that the cabinet door delivery took longer than planned). He also mentioned taking advantage of running the cabinets from top to bottom on two walls to get as much storage as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With cabinets of varying sizes, they chose flat-panel doors to streamline the look rather than the Shaker-style that was initially under consideration. The couple opted for full-size appliances (they got their dishwasher!) since they cook and bake on a daily basis, while a counter-depth fridge was installed to save some space and make room for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry cabinet</a>. For unity between the backsplash and countertop, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble-looking quartz</a> was selected for both surfaces. To let in more light, their contractor also widened the window over the sink to give a clear view of the garden.</p>

<h3>Marc + Steve&#8217;s renovation tips</h3>
<p>Overall, the renovation took closer to three months—“a month or so longer than we hoped,” Marc shared. “But it was worth it!” While waiting on cabinet doors, his contractor tackled smaller projects, adding new baseboards and trim to the main living area, hanging pendants over the dining table, and removing the drop ceiling that continued throughout the rest of the ground floor. Marc tells us that working with his contractor was a great experience. “We are perfectionists, so we&#8217;d come home to see the work done each day and have a bunch of questions. He always answered patiently and quickly, or fixed things as soon as he could.”</p>
<p><strong>The couple&#8217;s advice to future renovators:</strong> “Check return policies on everything. We ordered a range hood online that wasn&#8217;t what we thought it was. They wouldn’t let us return it because you have to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reject it immediately at delivery</a>.” Another tip: Dust is going to get everywhere, even with a contractor who&#8217;s careful, so be prepared for some <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/clean-up-after-major-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clean-up after the work</a> is done.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34326" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Marc-Kitchen.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="816" height="1224" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />Why they love their new Sweeten kitchen</h3>
<p>The new space feels light and airy—and much bigger than before. “We can both stand in the kitchen at the same time and it&#8217;s not overly crowded,&#8221; Marc said. &#8220;Design-wise, it&#8217;s the kitchen we always wanted and I don&#8217;t think we have any regrets about the choices we made (and there were so many choices!).”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Marc and Steve were most excited for the new kitchen floor and the “wow” moment they achieved with patterned black-and-white tile.</p>

<h3>Flexibility within the renovation</h3>
<p>Due to the building’s landmark status and paper-thin walls, condo approvals were a lengthy process. Once they were complete, the renovation itself took two months. Their contractor encouraged them to keep cooking as a focus, meaning no TV in the kitchen and leaving the &#8220;binge-fests for the den.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Finding something modern</h3>
<p>The couple eagerly agreed on a modern look mixing closed cabinets and open shelves while pairing white and gray shaker-style cabinets with custom black walnut slabs. In the L-shaped kitchen, one of the black walnut slabs acts as a desktop in a built-in—a workspace ideal for her husband, who is usually up before dawn checking email.</p>

<h3>What to splurge and save on</h3>
<p>A white subway tile backsplash with dark gray grout and white quartz counters serve as a simple backdrop. The couple also used brass hardware to add a modern touch. They also planned to splurge on quality countertops, which are known for their durability. To afford this, the couple decided to pass on a highly-desired farmhouse sink for a more affordable stainless steel sink. Durability was a priority for the couple. “This kitchen was built to be used,” said the homeowner. With its greatly increased prep space and extended bar seating, we couldn’t agree more!</p>

<h3>Hosting in their renovated kitchen</h3>
<p>After hosting their first dinner party in the space, she received a thank-you from a friend who said, “I could spend all my days in that kitchen.” The hostess’ response: “And that’s exactly our plan.”</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Nadia</i></span></p>
<h3>Keeping it together but separate</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The truth is we had a long list of desires when it came to buying our first home together. We wanted a house that was true to the time it was built, but clean and crisp and modernized. We bought it knowing that it needed a renovation, and as such lined up our contractor as we were finalizing the purchase. We wanted to start our renovation within a week of the closing and pay both mortgage and rent for no more than eight weeks. </span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44178 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20.jpg" alt="portrait, NYC, Brooklyn, construction, home renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because Stephen’s mother was moving in with us, and she is <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unable to manage stairs</a>, we needed a first-floor space for her. The house was a two-family home, with an upstairs apartment that was separate from the garden-level duplex. We decided to create a single-family house using the parlor level as entertaining space, allowing us to live separately, but together.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have a background in interior design and Stephen has renovation experience, but this was for both of us our first construction project in New York City. Our vision was of a house that would feel contiguous </span><span class="s1">but not too chopped up and not sterile. To that end, we drew lines with a well-curated mix of surfaces, and the outcome is fantastic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8.jpg" alt="townhouse living room" width="1000" height="670" class="alignnone wp-image-44177 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8-600x402.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Real hardwood floors</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house most needed a revamp on the garden and top floors along with proper bedrooms and a full-house fire/CO2 monitoring system. </span><span class="s2">Our plan was to tear out the existing fake-wood flooring on both levels and replace it with hardwood, and</span><span class="s1"> save the original floors on the parlor level</span><span class="s2">. </span><span class="s1">We chose a dark-wood flooring with a hand-scraped finish that was not ridiculously expensive. We needed it to hold up to kids, dogs, a walker, and it really has. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1">On the garden level where my mother-in-law has her own ap</span></span><span class="s1"><span class="s1">artment, the foyer was updated with full marble slabs on the walls and floor. In the back,</span>the laundry room got a better egress to the backyard. Additionally, it functions as a mudroom with custom cabinetry and a pull-down drying rack where we can hang wet clothes. The bathroom received a simple replacement of fixtures and a coat of paint which changed it completely</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The existing kitchen was L-shaped with very little counter space and a mobile dishwasher. As</span><span class="s1"> a big cooking family, we are very heavy users of the kitchen. By shifting the main k</span>itchen to one wall—including a dishwasher, wall oven, and a larger sink—it provided space for an island, a wrap-around pantry, and dining table.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s amazing how much the wrap-around pantry holds. Since it&#8217;s the other main kitchen wall, we could only fit 12&#8243;-15&#8243; deep cabinets. Instead of upper and lowers, we installed full-height 15&#8243; upper cabinets and are able to store an enormous amount of pantry and serving items. <span class="s1">The cabinet finishes are white and acacia and topped with a highly durable quartz surface including a big, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">walk-around island</a>.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Heading up to the parlor floor, we removed the stair runner and painted the stair treads, risers, balusters, and spindles in one color. We used the black paint in a flat finish on the stair boards, and a pearl finish on the railings for extra luster.</span></p>

<h3>Specific bathroom features</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom gut reno on the top floor focused on creating a stand-up shower. Stephen and I travel a lot for work and have huge pet peeves. We wanted to turn on the water without getting wet and have a shelf or bench to put a foot upon or sit on. We chose a glass surround with a frameless structure to make the room feel as open as possible. The custom vanity is made of walnut, with four drawers that maximize countertop and storage space. It all fits nicely in a tiny-but-functional 5’ x 8’ bathroom space.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<p><span class="s1">We ended up skim coating almost the entire house, and our Sweeten contractor worked miracles on the original plaster that was uneven and had an unappealing, thick texture. <span class="s1" style="color: #333333;">It gave us a lot more understanding of how hard it really is to properly repair plaster so that it looks like new!</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4.jpg" alt="shower seat" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-44180 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most difficult part of the renovation was the last six weeks, when we were living in the house, still under construction, with a three-year-old. Living in a space being renovated is challenging and exhausting, but our contractor staged the work so we could move in, and the crew became like family! It’s doable if you have fully functioning bathrooms and kitchen. Sweeten assisted throughout, from matching us with a contractor to providing a full bid review, and checking in about issues or concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the end, we increased the scope of what we wanted to do significantly and our costs grew—but we got it all done in the</span><span class="s1"> range of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 to $150 per square foot</a>. Doing it simultaneously means that now we can enjoy our home and our time together as a multigenerational family. </span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Nadia and Stephen, for sharing your new home with us!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Inspiring makeovers of the most popular room in the home</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful kitchen renovation isn’t measured by the number of walls knocked down or the size of a kitchen island. Instead, it&#8217;s the thoughtful details and design elements culled over time from Pinterest and the hours of research on materials coming to life that brings the joy for a lifestyle that finally fits you and your family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we look at 11 kitchens renovated by homeowners who came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, </span><span class="s1">a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some were major transformations removing walls, creating built-ins, and adding new windows, while others proved that smart improvements in space efficiency, updated materials, and renewed layouts gave them the overall refreshes they wanted. </span></p>
<h3>From outdated to classic gray</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After living on Long Island for many years, Rosalind and Lawrence were ready to downsize and return to their beloved former hometown of Brooklyn. They purchased a 100-year-old home in Cypress Hills and slowly started renovating the outdated spaces. After refreshes of two bathrooms, a staircase, and a walk-in closet were complete, they decided to turn their attention to the kitchen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main problem besides the yellow walls, dated wooden cabinets, and orange-tiled backsplash, was the lack of storage. Rosalind was forced to store her larger appliances like the slow cooker and mixer in the living room. So, with the help of a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor, the couple <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchen-tv-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reimagined their layout</a> and added a kitchen island that doubles as storage as well as a convenient gathering spot. Rosalind chose gray tones throughout and accented them with interesting geometric shapes.</span></p>
<hr />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoko and Rob really liked their 900-square-foot apartment in Harlem, New York. The only thing that gnawed at them was the “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">orange-y cabinetry, shiny black appliances, and brown countertop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” So they decided to take the plunge and redo the small kitchen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They did their research and found information from designer </span><a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keren Richter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on how to make the most of their cook space and turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to execute their vision. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to overhauling the look of the kitchen, they wanted to improve the flow and functionality with more storage as their top goal. Their original kitchen didn’t take advantage of the ceiling height so they extended the new upper cabinetry to get as close as possible to the ceiling. In all, they were able to create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sunny-kitchen-harlem-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimalist style yet warm space</a> to cook in and entertain.</span></p>

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you make a house feel more like a loft apartment? First, you open up the layout so that you have an unobstructed sightline across the first floor. For Romuald and his family, this meant tearing down a wall between the kitchen and the main living space. To regain the storage space lost by removing the cabinets on that wall, they decided to do what many do: build an island. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-apartment-inside-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added other design touches</a> to fit into their cooking-centric lives. Their </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contractor suggested they install an “appliance garage” to make their countertop less cluttered. Being avid cooks, Romuald and his wife have a lot of small appliances, including a toaster, coffee maker, and mixer, that would be nicely concealed—but yet easily accessible—by this storage solution. They also put in a pot-filler above the stove and a microwave drawer in the island. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The warm gray cabinets complement the white quartz countertop and the classic subway tile of the backsplash. For ease of cleaning and added durability, Romuald installed a porcelain floor that mimics the look of real wood.</span></p>

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veteran renovators Jennifer and Joe always knew their New Jersey apartment wouldn’t be complete without a kitchen remodel. They, like many homeowners, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/edgewater-new-jersey-kitchen-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wanted an open-concept layout</a> in order to see the amazing views of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Manhattan skyline, Statue of Liberty, and George Washington Bridge that their apartment affords. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They asked their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor to knock down a wall to get better sightlines to the wall of windows in their living room. Unfortunately, the entire wall could not be removed as it was load-bearing. So their contractor took down as much of the wall as possible and utilized the rest of the space to house the refrigerator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer and Joe based the design entirely around the marble waterfall island, which features a deep black base with white veins throughout the countertop. The color palette of the entire kitchen plays off the two tones, with glossy black drawers and all-white upper and lower cabinetry as well as a white quartz countertop. Not one detail was spared, from the under-cabinet lighting to the textured backsplash.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/mid-century-scandinavian-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">midcentury Scandi meets 70s Italian modern</a>,” says Brooklyn Sweeten homeowner Melissa of her design preference for her kitchen. The co-op building itself had a midcentury vibe so she wanted to continue it inside. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first, her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor removed walls that were blocking off the kitchen from the living area. Once that was complete, natural sunlight bathed the entire apartment. She carefully selected a mix of different materials (matte concrete floor and counters) as well as warmer accents in her textile and paint choices. A built-in shelf intersects over a new peninsula for additional seating. She didn’t <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/plumbing-changes-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">move the plumbing</a> (which is an added cost) or change the location of the appliances. </span></p>

While they desired a nod to the industrial roots of the building, they did want the aesthetic to be balanced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They hired a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor to help redefine the space. To create an open floor plan, a wall was removed as well as the upper cabinets, which were replaced with beautiful open shelves of salvaged Douglas Fir. The base cabinets were updated from laminate to a full set of IKEA cabinets and drawers, <a href="https://sweeten.com/tag/semihandmade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customized by Semihandmade</a>. A modern waterfall countertop on the peninsula was used to visually </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate the kitchen entry.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They also utilized </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">different natural and synthetic wood finishes to maintain a measure of warmth and masculinity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after tackling other updates to their colonial-style home, Nydia and Jonathan knew that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/modern-colonial-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovating their Brooklyn kitchen</a> was a top priority. The old version had mismatched appliances, dated cabinets, and not enough counter space. The dark space hardly felt welcoming (or functional) for their family of five. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to help with the construction process, hiring a trusted contractor from its carefully vetted network. The project involved rethinking the layout to opening up the stairway to the basement, which is accessed via the kitchen. The renovation helped key kitchen elements find new locations: the refrigerator moved out of the main cooking area, the dishwasher now sits directly across from the sink, and the walls surrounding the basement stairs were taken down. By replacing existing cabinets with ceiling-height ones and adding a peninsula, the space was really transformed.</span></p>

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mutual love of cooking (and of cooking together) ultimately led Marissa and Jeremy to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-kitchen-fit-for-the-lights-on-broadway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovate their small kitchen</a> in their Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, co-op. The space was so cramped that it brought about a special house rule: Only one person allowed in the kitchen at a time when cooking in order to keep the peace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty-four inches of usable counter space was quintupled through the renovation, while other unique elements were added to suit the couple’s preferences and lifestyle. For example, they went non-traditional for the backsplash, using an antique mirror. They also installed a ventless </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">washer/dryer combo unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and removed the space-invading </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gas dryer vent. “While a gas dryer dries clothes much faster than a ventless dryer, I wanted the extra counter space more than I wanted clothes dried in 20 minutes,” Marissa said. They capped off the gas vent and went long with the back counter. “I am excited about so many parts of our kitchen that I don’t know if I can pick a favorite!” she said.</span></p>

<h3>A modern vision brought to life through an extension</h3>

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Laura and Tim, they decided they needed to do something about their kitchen that was “falling apart”—it had water damage from a leaky shower upstairs, the door to the patio was drafty, the cabinets were dark and “grungy,” and it generally just needed some fixing up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple consulted their friend and designer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzy Leon of </span><a href="https://www.suzyleondesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzy Leon Design, Ltd.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and came up with a plan to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-patio-house-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gut the existing kitchen but also enclose their back patio</a>. The additional interior square footage would connect and provide a better flow between the kitchen, dining room, and outdoor space. The new enclosure would feature skylights to brighten the space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They kept the galley layout but chose a light color palette in the “minty” green shaker cabinets to offset the dark plank wood floors. White quartz countertops were utilized to help make the flow look more open and airy.</span></p>

<h3>Reaching new heights—with less ceiling</h3>

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an 18-inch tiny dishwasher, an oven that wasn’t big enough to fit a cookie tray, and a kitchen sitting underneath a loft, a renovation was long overdue for this mom who cooked five nights a week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One major challenge homeowners Emily and Trey faced was the inability to move the building&#8217;s intercom system that was smack in the middle of the kitchen. They hired a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor who came up with a good solution: create an L-shaped peninsula to accommodate the immovable pole—and give them more space and storage at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the new peninsula, they were also able to get rid of the loft above, which increased the ceiling height drastically. The result was <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-remodel-breaks-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a well-thought-out new kitchen</a> perfect for the family of four&#8217;s busy lifestyle.</span></p>

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer and Jonn couldn’t believe their luck when they found their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom duplex in Manhattan&#8217;s Upper East Side. It was the perfect location for their family of two kids and a dog. The story goes that the co-op was the result of combining three one-bedroom apartments to create a huge two-level residence with sole access to a sprawling rear garden. Voila! The perfect home&#8230;but with one catch: It needed to be renovated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple had their work cut out for them with this space that hadn&#8217;t been updated since the &#8217;70s. They hired a contractor through <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> who was able to transform their <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/duplex-remodel-first-time-renovators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white laminate kitchen into a light-filled galley kitchen</a> with an eat-in banquette. They used shaker cabinets and five-panel doors while incorporating metals like brass lights and stainless steel appliances for a modern look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kitchens are arguably one of the most pivotal spaces in our homes. From giving us a gathering point to break bread together to providing space to tackle assignments and hobbies; every kitchen should deliver the kind of peace of mind (and organizational flow) that homeowners need. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: A builder-grade kitchen refreshes for a work-from-home chef and caterer</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: After temporarily living in a large flat in Europe, Arnish and Brenden returned to New York City with a hankering for more space. They found it in Downtown Brooklyn in the 1929 BellTel Lofts landmark building. Unhappy with the experience of an earlier bathroom renovation (done by a non-Sweeten contractor), Arnish, a chef, waited until he had a very clear idea of what he wanted to do in the kitchen before <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/29935" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posting the project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted contractors. Arnish <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose this contractor</a> to execute his entire vision for his dream kitchen.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42814 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Arnish-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation before" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Arnish-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Arnish-Kitchen-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Arnish-Kitchen-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aesthetically, the style of the kitchen was not to Arnish’s taste &#8211; the combination of the work surface and cabinets was too dark and the countertops were prone to staining. Functionally, there were many deficiencies that he wanted to remedy: the kitchen sink was too shallow for large pots, and the cabinets not deep enough for all of the equipment, gadgets, and dry goods. He also wanted to improve the flow of the space. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: Arnish uses the words, “sleek, modern, and high-end” to describe his new kitchen—and it is exactly that! “I dislike clutter and I love keeping my kitchen and home organized,” he shared. </span><span class="s1">He didn’t want it to be too taste-specific for resale purposes, so they chose bright white, smudge-proof cabinets. And instead of handles or pulls, their contractor suggested ”tip and touch” for a cleaner look. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42806" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish.jpg" alt="chef in his kitchen" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42803" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-4.jpg" alt="minimalist kitchen" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-4.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The veins in the quartz countertops add a bit of drama, as does the peninsula. As a chef/caterer and everyday cook, Arnish planned for larger appliances, a pantry for dry food storage, an appliance garage, a pull-out spice rack, a hidden trash/recycling drawer, and a large, deep sink. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He also moved their peninsula a foot closer to the stove and closed up what had been two feet of unusable “dead space.” On top of the &#8220;must-have&#8221; list was a huge peninsula that would accommodate his catering and cooking prep as well as for big parties. &#8220;We set up a bar on the peninsula and guests gravitate towards the kitchen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Sometimes we have up to 80 people in the space.&#8221; With the piece of furniture also holding a wine fridge, he got everything he wanted. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43053 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Arnish-kitchen-pantry.gif" alt="Kitchen pantry storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42805 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-6.jpg" alt="Wine fridge in peninsula of kitchen" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-6.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-6-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout the remodel, the contractor had a specific team member in his office assigned to their project who kept in constant communication. “His office also used an app called Buildertrend that kept me updated on the status, including scheduling, deliveries, “to-do’s”, and material selections, which was very helpful. I never felt left in the lurch,” Arnish explained.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When asked how his new kitchen made him feel, Arnish replied, “Thrilled is an understatement. I feel so fortunate that I get to cook for my husband and entertain our friends in a space that I love. As a chef, I spend so much of my time in the kitchen and I believe that my food tastes better in my new kitchen. This space truly reflects my taste and style and whoever comes into the space can tell that this kitchen was designed by and for me.”</span></p>

</ul>
<h3>A new kitchen layout</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Gina and Andrew, who met while working on the Broadway production of <em>Billy Elliot</em>, purchased a pre-war two-bedroom apartment in Sunnyside, Queens, the year they married. The kitchen did not inspire them to cook <i>at all</i>, with its drab stock cabinets and awkward layout, completely sectioned off from the living area. After 2.5 years of ownership, they decided they were ready to tackle the renovation. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42274 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-14.jpg" alt="Renovators' family portrait" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-14.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Inspired to cook</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">What was a dim and cramped space is now an oasis. Andrew says, “I never used to cook and after our renovation, I’m cooking up a storm!” The homeowners worked with their </span><span class="s4">Sweeten general contractor</span><span class="s2"> to bring the color from their co-op courtyard into the home. They wanted to extend the natural green and chose a beautiful agave for the lower cabinets, while going with white for uppers to better reflect the light.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Warm brass hardware pops against the cooler tones of the cabinetry and white sink. A new stacked washer and dryer replaced the refrigerator, which relocated to a space closer to the kitchen window. Opposite the new fridge, a floor-to-ceiling <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-cabinets-in-motion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry with pull-out drawers</a> provides plenty of space for dry goods storage. </span></p>

<h3>Living at home during a renovation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">As first-time renovators, Gina and Andrew learned a lot during the experience. They report that their biggest challenge was <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living at home during the renovation</a>, with their dog, Brewster. However, Andrew also found it useful to be on-site during the renovation since he was able to check in regularly with the contractor and was able to follow along on the progress. While the removal of a load-bearing wall required architectural drawings to be submitted for approval, it was well worth it to have a kitchen more connected to the living and dining spaces. They also gained a breakfast bar by opening up a pass-through. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42272 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry, pull-out drawers" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s5"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span class="s6">: Fifty feet of unusable hallway space was repurposed into a dining area thanks to borrowing square footage from an adjacent second bedroom. Pocket doors were installed so that the interior space could remain “open and light could flow into the dining room.” They doubled their entertaining space by doing this! </span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: As soon as Jo moved into her Sutton Place home, she knew a kitchen renovation was in order. The space was disconnected and closed-off from the rest of the one-bedroom apartment, and the tall metal cabinets from the 1950s were impractical. As a product designer, she planned to be very hands-on with material selection, most of which would be neutral so that her colorful dishware could pop. “I’m very changeable in terms of my taste, I’m always looking to update my home accessories,” Jo shared.

Jo would’ve preferred to knock down the whole wall, but the building’s intercom system kept them from doing so. It ended up being the perfect spot to display plants!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jo focused her creative energy on curating materials, from the flooring to the appliances. She took inspiration from her travels. In Portugal, she discovered that cork was a popular flooring choice. It’s easy to clean, matches with parquet floors in her apartment, and is also very forgiving (Jo has dropped dishes from five feet or so off the ground—without them breaking!). The bamboo shelves, one that serves as a drying rack above the sink (</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brownstone-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to this renovator’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), were a play off of what she’d seen in Europe, too. Jo ordered the shelves, made some design modifications, and had her contractor execute the plans, sealing them to receive wet dishes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was Jo’s third renovation, so she came to the table with plenty of experience—and advice for first-timers. Namely, write everything down! Communication discrepancies are natural, so the best way to avoid them is to put everything in an email—and send follow-ups as needed. “I took the entire contract and expanded on it, because I didn’t want there to be any gaps,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her attention to detail paid off: “I love being in the new space, it’s enabled me to have more family celebrations.” </span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A 1960s East Hampton kitchen renovation</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Ann was looking for a contractor for over two years to renovate the kitchen in her East Hampton, New York, home. She just couldn’t find the right fit—price-or-quality-wise. Her dark and dated kitchen, in a one-story house built in 1964, had a faux brick backsplash and the original cabinetry. It just wasn’t cutting it for Ann, a big entertainer, with lots of family members who love to come over and cook. However, after finding Sweeten and reading other renovation stories on the blog, she made a move and </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted her kitchen renovation project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with an East Hampton contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who’d help turn the old-fashioned kitchen into host-worthy space.<br />
</span></p>

Daniel drew up the plans for an open kitchen, including removing the wall between the dining area and cook space and lifting the ceiling to a cathedral style (which was the contractor’s suggestion). Fortunately, those changes had a dramatic effect on the brightness and size of the room. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg"><br />
</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowner wanted a very timeless aesthetic. Flat-paneled white cabinets set the foundation for the classic look, complemented by white, taupe, and black granite countertops and gold cabinet hardware. Lighting above the island and the black-and-gold sink faucet echo the metallic hardware, tying it all together.</span></p>

As a first-time renovator, Ann was happy to have Sweeten Client Services available throughout the project. “It was great to know somebody was there for you,” she shared. She also had a great time working with her contractor, who encouraged her to take time picking out the materials. Above all, he told her to not rush it—a renovation is not something that’s done every day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patience was Ann’s main focus from the very start, since she waited to find a contractor she felt confident in. The homeowner suggests that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">future renovators do the same: shop around, speak with as many people as you can, and do research. This isn’t a process worth speeding through!</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A year and a half into owning and living in their Riverdale, Bronx, home Elizabeth and Martin were ready to renovate their 124-square-foot galley kitchen. Inspired by other remodeled kitchens in their 1955 co-op building, they got an idea for how they could transform the layout to better suit their needs. Elizabeth, a research analyst for a public policy consulting firm, and Martin, a product designer for a video streaming company, posted their </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">project on Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a design-build firm</span></a> where they worked with both a designer and a contractor.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41780 size-full" title="kitchen-images-with-radiator-before-renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" alt="two images of kitchen with half walls and white cabinets and tile flooring and a window above radiators before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-Before-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-Before-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-Before-02-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-with-white-cabinets-before-renovation" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41778" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-Before-02-1.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and backsplash tiles and top mount stainless steel sink before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-Before-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-Before-02-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-Before-02-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The biggest change? Knocking down walls between the kitchen and the entryway area to bring in more natural light. Their contractor also took down a partial wall between the kitchen and dining space to connect them. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to make the most of our floor space, have an open layout, and have comfortable dimensions for navigating the kitchen. We wouldn’t have felt as confident in our decision making in this area, but having the designer’s expertise and experience to make layout recommendations and to see her sketches (from every angle!) of the design made us comfortable with the plan, “ Elizabeth shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renovators wanted a clean and classic kitchen with plenty of prep space and minimal clutter. They worked with the designer to come up with practical storage solutions, including a set of glass-front cabinets, microwave cabinet, and built-in paper towel holder. The peninsula breakfast bar seats four to six and offers additional storage, too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth and Martin shopped with their designer to pick out materials, including the lava stone backsplash and quartz countertop. Copper cabinet hardware pops against the white custom cabinets and adds to the mix of metals (matte black for the sink faucet and stainless steel appliances).</span></p>

Our contractor helped by providing a detailed scope of work and being communicative and responsive to emails throughout the project.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They relied on Sweeten from the get-go for reviewing and </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leveling quotes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But, most importantly, “knowing Sweeten was available and present to step in if needed, offered us a lot of peace of mind throughout the planning and execution of our renovation,” Elizabeth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their new space reinvigorated Martin&#8217;s love for cooking and unlike pre-renovation, the couple actually enjoys spending time together in their kitchen now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The couple adopted a cat, Norah J., as their renovation wrapped up. </span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: After a few years of renting in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Natalia and Daniel were ready to buy a place of their own. They found a two-bedroom co-op with a great location (across the street from Fort Greene Park!), knowing a renovation would be necessary to make the 1950s space feel like home. The to-be remodelers (who were also expecting their first child!) wanted to take advantage of the large windows and natural light, and better connect the dark and tight galley kitchen to the rest of the living space. The TV producer and creative director </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/33798" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sweeten and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4894" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Important, though not visible changes, like updating the electrical wiring, became a high priority. “It’s actually a huge peace-of-mind knowing that the air-conditioning won’t short-circuit the dishwasher,” Daniel shared. From there, they skim-coated the walls and ceilings across the apartment to smooth out years of bad paint jobs and patchwork. The floors were also spruced up, sanded down, and refinished to look brand new.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renovators decided to extend the counter space into the dining area as a serving surface. It also helps join the rooms. Since the galley-style cooking space was tight, the couple chose a slim refrigerator and narrow base cabinets on one side to improve flow.</span></p>

Not only was the couple paying rent and a mortgage simultaneously, but they also had a baby on the way! Their contractor and his team worked hard to meet their chosen deadline and helped the first-time renovators navigate the process from start to finish. “He also was able to fill in the gaps on the small things you don&#8217;t think about as a first-time renovator, like the right ways to get the wood and tile floors to meet in the kitchen. He often provided those materials himself, or ordered them for us,” Daniel shared. </span></p>

But honestly, the biggest help is just at the beginning—finding a reliable contractor with good reviews. It sounds simple, but it isn&#8217;t,” Daniel said.</span></p>

<h3>A style fix</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roxana and Gabriel’s Long Island City, Queens, loft boasts 15-foot ceilings and loads of natural light. The apartment’s kitchen, however, didn’t suit the couple’s Scandinavian, minimalist style. It lacked counter space, the sink was smaller than standard, and the to-be renovators just weren’t vibing with the finishes. They wanted integrated appliances with all clean lines and everything stowed away in cabinets or drawers. The rest of their home has walnut and matte finishes throughout, so they knew they wanted a similar aesthetic in the cooking space, too. The couple, a creative director and software engineer, who also has a three-year-old son, </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/36746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sweeten and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3>New cabinetry</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed with a clear perspective, the couple got to work with their contractor to reimagine their kitchen. Gabriel used the Ikea kitchen planner tool to lay out the space, exploring its customization offerings to suit their needs. The cabinetry is all Ikea but modified to cover the appliances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wall cabinet containing the range hood is shorter and wider than the surrounding units but is still covered by the same door size. The refrigerator, which moved from the main kitchen area into what was formerly a coat closet proved to be one of the biggest challenges. They had to find the right size to not only fit into the existing space, but also align with Ikea panels. “The fridge hunt was probably the single largest use of our time. Ask my wife about chasing our son through AJ Madison,” Gabriel said. Their contractor ended up cutting a 36 inch Ikea panel into three pieces to integrate the refrigerator with the walnut cabinets. They also fit in a cabinet right next to it. All of the drawers and wall cabinets are equipped with LED lighting, adding to the custom feel.</span></p>

<h3>Patience from their general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sleek aesthetic carried throughout their material choices, from the matte black faucet, lack of cabinet hardware, and a single slab counter and backsplash without any seams. “Our contractor was very patient with all my crazy ideas and helped me make them actually work,” Roxana said. “He helped brainstorm a lot of the Ikea ‘hacking’ and was very patient with us,” she continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Gina, a product director, and Dan, who works in account and finance, moved into his childhood home in Media, Pennsylvania, after relocating for a new job and learning they were going to start a family (their son Jack is now 2 years old). Dan’s parents were planning to retire and head south, so the couple rented their 1950s traditional brick, split-level home for a few years. It gave them time to think about the work they’d complete if they decided to make it their own. When they did buy it, the first-time homeowners had a renovation vision underway for the old-fashioned kitchen. The layout wasn’t ideal for entertaining or cooking, and they wanted to increase the square footage, too. “We wanted a bright, open kitchen that was traditional but with clean, modern touches,” Gina shared. The duo <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their Media kitchen renovation project</a> to Sweeten and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>

Instead of having a traditional table and chairs, we wanted to have stools all around the table where people could casually gather,” Gina said. Plus, they still have a separate dining area on the lower level of the home in what was once a living room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take advantage of their much larger kitchen, the renovators decided against installing upper cabinetry. Ceiling-height cabinets surrounding the two-door refrigerator and island drawers offer more than enough storage.</span></p>

Sweeten matched Gina and Dan with a general contractor they felt comfortable with and worked hand-in-hand with them to first come up with a plan and then execute it. As a former project manager, Gina especially appreciated the contractor’s detailed timelines that laid out when each renovation step would occur. “They set up times for each task and ended up wrapping things up earlier than expected. They took whatever extra time they had and tried to get other things done based on the project, which really helped keep everything on track,” she shared.</span></p>

<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41080 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Daniel-Hawkings-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Daniel-Hawkings-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Daniel-Hawkings-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Daniel-Hawkings-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span id="m_1960406457062611370gmail-docs-internal-guid-75986107-7fff-bac8-4cdc-7bc165881db5">Renovating the kitchen with a one-year-old in tow also meant the family needed plenty of notice about noisier or more disruptive work, which their project manager always delivered. “Having a dedicated project manager who was as skilled as he was, made us a bit sad when the project was over and we knew we wouldn’t see him anymore—I actually cried and hugged him our last day. I think it’s very rare anyone ever has that reaction to a kitchen renovation,” Gina said.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Their contractor also replaced a window over the kitchen sink to match the other white framed ones.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Give a generic Jersey City kitchen a modern-industrial twist</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Every kitchen in a pencil-factory-turned-apartment complex in Jersey City, New Jersey, had the same look: brown cabinets, tan tiles, and black countertops. But homeowners Becky and Paul (and their two cats), who’d been living in their two-bedroom apartment almost three years, wanted their cook space to stand out. Their 120-square-foot galley kitchen had a workable layout and thanks to a look-through window, was also connected to the living space. It just needed a refresh of the fixtures and materials, plus more storage. The couple </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30876" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sweeten and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4260" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40861" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The first-time renovators got to work with their general contractor to select materials and appliances.  “If we chose something he thought from a professional standpoint wouldn’t work, he would not only explain why but have alternative options for us to review,” they shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were aiming for a bright and airy look with touches of industrial elements to align with their building style, which they achieved with white cabinets, a glossy backsplash, and pops of stainless steel in the faucet and farmhouse sink. The blue wall makes the room appear bigger and lighter, too.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40867 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="653" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05-300x196.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05-600x392.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wood-like tile floor (a growing trend in kitchen upgrades), floating wood shelves, and a corner of butcher block countertop add a natural appeal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the kitchen’s coolest new features: a built-in wine rack just above the sink that takes advantage of what would otherwise be empty space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong communication between the contractor and homeowners contributed to the successful completion of the project. If issues cropped up, like delayed deliveries, that would affect timing or cost, the contractor contacted the homeowners right away and found solutions quickly. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a newbie in renovation, this level of communication and education was greatly appreciated. He was also such a champion for us when ordering materials and always put his clients&#8217; needs first when working with vendors,” they shared. The renovators didn’t run into any major issues, though their friendly cats did try to lend a paw throughout the process. On workdays, Becky and Paul set them up in their bedroom to keep them out of the construction zone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten Client Services also just checked in throughout the project to make sure the process was going smoothly. “We could not be more grateful to have such a terrific support system,&#8221; they shared.</span></p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Improve the layout and look of a drab Jersey City kitchen</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: Anne wanted to wait to move into her Jersey City co-op apartment until she renovated the kitchen. After six years of renting, she bought the apartment knowing it would need some work. “I saw 35 finished apartments that just were not ‘me,’ so I was very open to the idea of purchasing a place that needed a little work to make it my own,” she said. Having grown up with a family very comfortable with renovations, Anne was more than ready to take on a project. On her wish list? A kitchen layout optimized for cooking, with plenty of natural light and a mix of traditional and modern details. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/29534">posted her project on Sweeten</a> and after considering her matches chose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4260">Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37363 size-full" title="anne-posing-in-her-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="anne standing in her kitchen after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: In order to make the best use of the small space, a wall with a cut-out into the living room (and that housed appliances) came down. Knocking it down allowed more light to come into the living room from the window over the sink. Otherwise, the footprint remained the same, with the kitchen sink and dishwasher on one wall, the stove on another.</p>
<p>The builder-grade cabinets were swapped with white shaker cabinets, adding the traditional touch Anne was aiming for. “I picked tall cabinets that went all the way up to the ceiling, and my contractor installed trim at the top to make them look custom,” she said. A classic subway tile backsplash and quartz countertops tied the whole look together. New hardwood flooring in both the kitchen and living area united the space.</p>
<p>A few roadblocks came up during the project, such as outdated electrical and plumbing, but Anne’s contractor handled it all—without delaying the estimated completion time. “The biggest thing that was important for me was to have a timeline that worked. My rental lease was up and I needed a place to live,” she said. Anne was able to move in right on time and start enjoying her new kitchen. Selecting the new cabinets and counters was her favorite part of the process, as was seeing it come together over the weeks of renovation. “It’s extremely rewarding to see how great everything turned out and having your own space that is exactly how you would want it!&#8221;</p>

<h3>A dire kitchen storage situation is resolved</h3>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Add more storage and bring a kitchen up to date</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: Kate and Matt loved Jersey City and their home, but were more than ready to refresh their kitchen. Cheap ‘80s-era cabinets were showing their age and the storage situation was dire. The galley set-up also limited their options to expand and create a more cook-friendly space. Kate’s main ask, besides a completely new look, was a breakfast bar. “I spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking,” she said, “so I really craved a little spot in which to sit.” <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19777">She posted her project on Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3189">chose her Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="beige-kitchen-cabinets-white-countertop"  class="alignnone wp-image-30957 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02.jpg" alt="beige kitchen cabinets and white countertop in a kitchen with brown floor before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Luckily, the galley layout proved less of an obstacle than anticipated. She worked with her Sweeten contractor, settling on a built-in breakfast bar at the far end of the kitchen, just above the stairs. The couple worried about the potential for things to fall of the ledge to the floor below, but their contractor&#8217;s recommendation of a raised back on the bar eliminated their concern.</p>
<p>The good fortune continued, as they discovered during demolition the soffits that were taking up valuable wall space were empty. They were removed, and taller upper cabinets installed. To make the galley kitchen feel brighter, the couple chose light materials for the countertops and backsplash to counteract the new gray cabinets.  Their contractor also moved the refrigerator and dishwasher, optimizing the layout for more storage options.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: After moving from an apartment in Kensington, Brooklyn, to a brownstone in Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, Christina and Aaron were ready to renovate their “new” kitchen. Located in a 2,600-square-foot brownstone originally built in 1901, the cook space was definitely showing its age. The multi-color cabinets and floors were falling apart and the appliances were also outdated. Aaron, a director of child programming, and Christina, a registered nurse, wanted a clean and contemporary kitchen better suited for their family of three (including their son Maverick). The couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/31654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to Sweeten and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple chose ceiling-high custom cabinets, with the bottom units painted in a rich navy and the uppers in white. Aside from the refrigerator and cabinets above, they left one wall open to include a small table and two chairs next to a big window. Just outside the kitchen and right off their separate dining room, they converted part of the hallway into an extra pantry area. The floating shelves match the ones used in the far end of the kitchen built from reclaimed wood from <a href="https://www.bigreuse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Reuse</a>.</span></p>

From the beginning, he provided a detailed plan outlining the timeline, a list of needed materials, and recommended businesses and suppliers. Sweeten Client Services also checked in on the project status and contractor performance to ensure the couple was happy with the progress.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest challenges we faced with this project were the unexpected discoveries that would often add on to the workload and adjust the timeline of the project, such as the discovery that the floor needed to be re-leveled before tiling,” Aaron said. The electrical also needed to be updated to power the new appliances and the ceiling height had to be adjusted due to pre-existing damage. If you’re renovating an older home, Aaron strongly advises leaving plenty of room wiggle room in your budget because during demolition, issues that weren’t noticeable before can come to the surface.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Cooking has become so much easier and enjoyable thanks to their new counter space and the bigger stove.</span></p>

<h3>These homeowners needed their own space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When my husband and I got married, my father generously offered us one of their spare bedrooms for nothing more than covering our share of the utilities and cleaning the entire property. My parents kept to themselves mostly, but even so, after six years of cleaning up after them and sharing common spaces, we had had enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had a sizeable down payment due to some fortunate events, enough for a house, but with my husband starting his own business, we decided to buy an affordable co-op and hoped for one that was move-in ready. To our dismay, we quickly found out that co-ops in Northeast Queens were either outdated or renovated in a way that we found ugly and gaudy (think McMansion but inside a co-op). Eventually, we bought a two-bedroom for a reasonable price that hadn’t been updated since it was built in the &#8217;50s, which meant we would have to nearly gut the entire place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Asking for recommendations from friends and family for contractors only led to horror stories about shoddy work, condescending attitudes, cheap materials, a lack of knowledge, and poor communication. We contacted eight contractors total and three of them were from Sweeten. Because Sweeten has an entire system for communicating with contractors, the process was so much smoother. Each one visited the site and gave us an itemized quote within the week and promptly answered our questions. It was actually difficult to choose, but in the end, we went with the contractor that we felt the most comfortable talking to since all the quotes were similar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-Before-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33678 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-Before-05-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, queens co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33668 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, queens co-op, hardwood floors, kitchen, gold accents" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Finding a contractor is hardwork</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the other five contractors, those experiences became their own horror stories from just meeting with them and getting quotes. The worst was one contractor who gave us a two-hour window for when he would show up, arrived in the last five minutes, talked on the phone the entire time, did not follow up with a quote, would not give an itemized quote when I followed up, and called a week later saying he vaguely remembered talking to me and was wondering if I still needed a quote. Well, I didn’t.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovations started almost immediately once we picked our contractor. Together, my husband and I selected and bought all the finishing materials. Garden-style co-ops tend to be small, so we picked light colors to make the rooms feel spacious and bright. The color theme continued in the form of off-white <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen cabinets</a>, light-colored tiles in the bathroom, and soft gray walls with white ceilings for most of the rooms. We also really like highly contrasting design, so the accents we chose were typically dark, such as the bathroom hardware, doorknobs, and most of the flooring. Gold accents were only used in the kitchen because I love the look of white kitchens with touches of gold.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33670 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-07-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, queens co-op, kitchen, gold accents" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33672 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-09-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, queens co-op, hardwood floors, kitchen, gold accents" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>This Queens co-op remodel allows for a more spacious kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided early on to have kitchen cabinets that extended to the ceiling for the extra storage because we both love to cook and the existing built-in storage was limited. I also added another wall of cabinets, which includes a full-sized pantry. We will eventually install a vented range hood above the stove, and I wanted to keep the countertops as clutter-free as possible, so I hid the microwave in the pantry. We also opted for a single drawer dishwasher because we found a full-sized unit to be excessive for just two people. The dishwasher serves as our drying rack while the extra drawer under the dishwasher is extra storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33667 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-04-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, queens co-op, hardwood floors, kitchen, gold accents" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33669 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, queens co-op, hardwood floors, kitchen, gold accents" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>A bathroom that is easy to clean</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the bathroom, we went with the typical tub and shower curtain instead of a sliding glass door because it feels more open, and for us, it is easier to clean. We chose the floating sink cabinet for similar reasons. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tiles</a> are in a herringbone pattern to give it a more interesting look. Since the space is small, it was not that much more expensive to do and is one of the most eye-catching parts of the bathroom. The same floor tile was used in the shower nook where we keep our soaps so the tub ledge is clutter-free. The mirrored medicine cabinet also hides a lot of our toiletries and is deceptively large; we had most of it buried into the wall so it would not stick out too far.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One snag was the full-sized drawers under the sink. The plumbing needed to be adjusted to have the drawers fit, but even still, they would not fully close. The contractor cut part of the back of the drawer walls to accommodate the plumbing after I made a very sad face at the idea that they would have to cut the entire drawer down. It’s not the most aesthetically pleasing but it’s not very noticeable and I am very happy I still have full-sized drawers.</p>
<h3>Drama during their Queens co-op remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ironically, the renovations were the easy part. We had much more difficulty with our own co-op management, which our contractor helped us navigate. We had to replace the kitchen plumbing because it was too old and leaking behind the wall. This required changing the plumbing on the adjacent units, too, so the co-op office had to coordinate the change between all the owners. As is typical in co-op living, drama ensued and no one cooperated which meant our project was stuck and it was up to us to get all the owners to agree. Our contractor went with us to each unit to explain what would happen even though they were not the ones replacing the plumbing. Magically, we easily got everyone’s agreement once they were told the entire situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An even more drama-filled incident was when the co-op started to change all the front doors and windows. We were warned that any damage during the change would be our problem so we asked if we would be able to get them changed during our renovation so that our contractor could immediately fix the damage. The office denied our request and we were ready to resign to our fate, but while complaining to our sympathetic contractor about the situation, he encouraged us to attend the annual meeting to make our case directly to the board. We are very glad we attended because 1) it was very entertaining with all the angry shouting, impassioned pleas, and one instance of a chair being thrown by a board member, and 2) the board granted our request. So we had the door and windows changed and unsurprisingly, it was done poorly and there was damage, which our contractor fixed. As for the drama, that continued for weeks and culminated with citizen notices threatening lawsuits and contacting New York City councilmen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall we had a wonderful experience making this apartment a home for us and our cat! Minus the drama.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A kitchen pares down with integrated appliances in a landmark Brooklyn building</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-kitchen-custom-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen with custom cabinets and kitchen island with butcher block after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Expanding a cramped kitchen in a Clinton Hill landmark townhouse</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: In 2013, Kate and her husband, Graham, purchased a 4-unit townhouse built in 1890 in Clinton Hill, and moved into it with her two brothers and their families. (They operate the apartments within the townhouse as informal condos and share costs and decision-making.) While they knew that there were changes that needed to be made, they did not consider a gut renovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-01-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" title="over-door-detailing-entrance-before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-01-723x482.jpg" alt="over door detailing and entrance before renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets and white counter before renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Four years down the line, after living in the space, they determined that expanding and redoing a tiny kitchen that was tucked into the back corner of their apartment was a priority. It was closed off from the rest of the apartment inside an addition to the original house. The addition had been divided into a small galley kitchen and a second room that was “too small to be a living room or a dining room,” explained Kate. The narrow kitchen had small, outdated appliances and the refrigerator was awkwardly placed in front of a window. It was hard for two people to pass each other in the space. Given that the kitchen did not function at all the way their family needed it to, the couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/21244" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project to Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Working with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Sweeten contractor</a>, Kate and Graham envisioned an open space so that meal prep could be “a family activity and a space for doing homework while dinner was getting made,” said Kate. They wanted to go vertical with custom cabinets and counters to maximize the amount of surface and storage space. While they did need to remove a wall and a closet, they were intent on retaining as much of the original wood and plaster detailing as possible so that the new kitchen would pair seamlessly with the rest of the prewar apartment.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen, landmark townhouse, white cabinets, pendant lights" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-kitchen-space-white-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="white open kitchen space with white kitchen cabinets and brown dining table after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pantry cabinet next to the sink got a makeover; the glass panels had either been replaced with plywood or painted over, so they had new glass put in. It now makes a nice display for cookbooks and spices. &#8220;We believe that before the addition was put on the back of the house, that door would have been the exterior door to the yard,&#8221; said Kate. Demo revealed that the molding and flooring had continued throughout the original space as they predicted. The new layout also allowed more light into the rest of the apartment.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" title="white-overhead-kitchen-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="white overhead kitchen cabinets over white quartz counter and open shelves after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="wide-doorway-white-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="wide doorway to a white kitchen space with white cabinets and pendant lights after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kate and Graham chose integrated appliances for a built-in look. Given that the kitchen is now in plain view from the rest of the apartment, they did not want it “to scream ‘kitchen,’” explained Kate. The refrigerator replaces what used to be a closet and looks as if it has always been there, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disguised by a cabinet front</a>. They attempted to minimize stainless steel with hardware and cabinet choices that were “understated, practical, and looked more like built-in furniture.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-06-723x1085.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-cabinets-small-white-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="white cabinets and a small white counter along with brown dining table after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While quartz was chosen for the backsplash and countertops around the stove and sink for its durability, they softened up the space by topping the oversized island with butcher block. The wood floors were sanded and refinished for continuity with the rest of the home.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-08.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-cabinets-white-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-08.gif" alt="white cabinets and a white counter on a brown vinyl floor after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinetry</a> was the most expensive choice that Kate and Graham made, but they &#8220;were committed to this expense from the beginning because [they] knew it was the only way to maximize storage space and because the cabinets are by far the most prominent feature of the kitchen,&#8221; said Kate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because they did not use an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/when-do-you-need-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect</a>, there was quite a bit of &#8220;game-time decision-making&#8221; that slowed things down. Now that the project is finished, however, the whole family loves the space. “The kids show off the fact that the fridge and microwave are hidden behind doors to everyone who comes over. We all spend most of our together-time in the kitchen now,&#8221; said Kate. &#8220;And when people come over, it&#8217;s where everyone inevitably ends up hanging out.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: By hiding ductwork behind the upper cabinets, the couple was able to remove the drop ceiling in the kitchen to gain more height in the space.</p>
