<p><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction + architecture?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: I was born in Easton, Maryland. I grew up there and moved to Newark, Delaware when I was 10.  I’ve been in the field of architecture and design since 2004.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: Originally from Wilmington, Delaware. I have been involved in the construction industry in some form since 1986.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get into the industry?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: I started my career as an interior designer, but always worked for architects in a role that more closely resembled an interior architect rather than a designer or decorator. During the recession, I was lucky enough to retain my job but shifted studios within the large firm I was working for and made the decision to pursue my architectural license. Dave put up with me during a year of maniacal studying while working full time and taking those exams to get the license.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>:  I started life in finance. I worked for a large financial company for over 12 years. At the same time, I had a side life in construction. I soon learned that I enjoyed seeing things get built rather than just moving numbers around. I made a bold decision to change my life to do something that challenges me every day in a way that I can enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love most about what you do?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan and David</span>: Transforming old run-down spaces into beautiful places that people can enjoy with their families. We really enjoy going into different buildings throughout the city that we&#8217;ve never been in to get a different taste of the city.</p>
<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New York?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: Designing spaces that maximize the layout and function for our clients while still meeting the (sometimes seemingly ridiculous) NYC Building Code restrictions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: Constraints: limited timeframes, limited building hours, unhappy neighbors, logistics for material deliveries, logistics moving crew to projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32502 size-chrono" title="Renovation Checklist" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-723x143.jpg" alt="Renovation Checklist" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-723x143.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-600x119.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist.jpg 975w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>If clients have questions or concerns, how would you like them to address them?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan and David</span>: We highly value communication and feel it is the most important part of the process. We want clients to bring their questions or concerns to us as soon as possible so that we can address them as quickly as possible. We use web-based software to manage projects and clients can post their questions/comments with pictures and our team can address them, but email and phone calls also work. However, please don’t text us at 3:00am—we have lives and families too.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: We’re going to encounter hiccups. That’s nearly a given. You’re hiring our team to navigate those hiccups in the least painful way possible so that you can continue to enjoy your life while we deal with the challenges.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: As with many things in life, you often get what you pay for. We are not the least expensive option in the city, but if you want good quality work from a full-service team that will commit to your project and give you a great experience, we’re worth every penny.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City building? </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: Oddly and not for architectural reasons, the Time Warner Center at Columbus.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: Grand Central Station.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City neighborhood?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: The West Village.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: The Financial District.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City restaurant?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan and David</span>: El Centro–before having a family, we used to go twice a week. Amazing margaritas and no-frills Mexican!</p>

			<h2>Ron&#8217;s favorite part of the job? Making a difference in someone&#8217;s life</h2>

<p><strong>What do you love most about construction?</strong></p>
<p>I love that I can transform a space and make it into what the client wants as well as my vision. The gratifying part is the thanks I receive for my work and the fact that I actually made a difference in someone’s life.</p>
<p><strong>If you couldn’t be a general contractor what would you be doing?</strong></p>
<p>I’d be painting.</p>
<p><strong>What are some myths or misconceptions about contractors that you want to set straight?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a misconception that all contractors are cheats and liars. It is a very challenging job, but I do think that contractors who are professional provide an incredible service to the community and I do think that we change lives for the better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32464 size-chrono" title="How to prep for a site visit" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-723x143.jpg" alt="general contractor, Brooklyn" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-723x143.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-600x119.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit.jpg 975w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Describe your ideal client.</strong></p>
<p>Someone who is open, knowledgeable, and has a good design sensibility.</p>
<p><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</strong></p>
<p>They should know that I am giving them my &#8220;all,&#8221; I am giving them 100%, and that their interest is my interest. I want to do the best job possible.</p>
<p><strong>If clients have concerns or issues with the project, how would you like them to handle it?</strong></p>
<p>We have an open door policy. If you have an issue with something, call us, talk to us—we are very responsive.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite renovation that you&#8217;ve done?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of my most recent renovations was renovating an 1839 brownstone in Brooklyn for a young couple. The experience was really awesome because they were very much involved and at the same time they totally respected and loved my crew and fed them almost every day. It just made the whole process incredibly joyful and pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>How do you like your coffee?</strong></p>
<p>Strong and…strong.</p>
<p><strong>Bagel or donut?</strong></p>
<p>Bagel.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite cuisine?</strong></p>
<p>I love Japanese cuisine, I do.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite New York restaurant?</strong></p>
<p>Nobu is one of my favorite New York restaurants.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite borough?</strong></p>
<p>Brooklyn is my favorite.</p>
