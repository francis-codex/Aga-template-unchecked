<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Mitzie and Jenifer bought their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-bedroom apartment in DUMBO</a>, they knew that a full home renovation was needed before moving in. A designer, Mitzie immediately started sketching out design plans and reached out to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a general contractor who could bring those plans to life. In the home renovation tips below, Mitzie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shares the couples&#8217; bedroom and kitchen renovation inspiration, and their experience working with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3918#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Sweeten general contractor</a> to improve the lighting in their new apartment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:05)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to our home. My name is Mitzie Wong. I live here with my partner Jenifer Harmon, who is a media executive. I&#8217;m a painter, designer, and co-founder of <a href="https://roarandrabbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roar + Rabbit</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:35)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to make the apartment feel very casual, yet luxurious. We had a budget in mind, so we were really careful about choosing the materials. We wanted it to feel very inviting and relaxing.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 1: </strong>A waterfall island brings living spaces together</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:53)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we saw the kitchen initially, it was very boxy. There were lots of angles, the cabinets were jutting out, the counters were short and narrow, so we wanted to make the place a lot more cohesive. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went for a bigger island</a>, deeper with the cascading waterfall marble sides, so it would be a feature because it&#8217;s an open plan to the living room. And we unified everything by color. Being an open plan, it had to be a feature. We hid the freezer and the fridge behind the same colors as the cabinet to make it more unified. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44522 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03.jpg" alt="home renovation designs, home renovation sketches" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We used the same hardware on the drawers and the doors to make it more cohesive, to give it a lighter and brighter space, and we obviously brought the counter forward to give it more a generous sense of space. Because everything was so new looking, I wanted to put in a handmade tile to just soften it up, to give it some texture and some depth.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41431 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03.jpg" alt="bedroom, bedroom renovation, home renovation tips for bedrooms" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 2: Turn a plain wall into a colorful headboard</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (01:58)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a fairly new building, it&#8217;s only 12 years old, so we wanted to give the apartment some character. As you&#8217;ll see, there&#8217;s a lot of build-outs and recesses and weird angles in each corner. I wanted to take the focal point away and make a feature wall. I used two-and-a-half-inch plywood beams and painted it to make an accent wall to give it layered depth. If you look slightly to the right, you&#8217;ll see the Manhattan bridge, and it&#8217;s a gray-blue, so that was part of the inspiration for the color. It&#8217;s a slightly off-color of the Manhattan bridge.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 3: </strong>Streamline storage and lighting</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (02:40)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We relied on our Sweeten contractor heavily on their expertise for lighting. They dropped the ceilings only two or three inches, and we were able to put in the recessed lighting in both the living room and the office, so we could maintain consistent lighting throughout the day and evening. When we were doing the initial renovation during the gutting stage, there was an additional six inches in the wall [of the master bathroom] that was revealed, so we were able to design together and build a bespoke cabinet.</span></p>

<span class="img-label"> Guest post by Sophia, Manhattan homeowner</span><span id="more-16382"></span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For five years, I had been parked in a 400 square foot rent-stabilized apartment at a great location on the Upper West Side. As a single person, I felt like it was spacious. When my husband moved <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1178174334" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">in three years</span></span> ago, 400 square feet seemed &#8220;cozy,&#8221; and once I gave birth to our son, Apollo, the space became woefully inadequate. It just could not contain the mountain of stuff that accompanies caring for a baby.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We entered the Manhattan housing market and had a terrible time for a few months; we made several offers and were outbid on everything. All of the two-bedroom apartments within our price range were such wrecks that with construction costs included, they would have been over budget. Two things we knew for sure: we were determined to stay within our budget and I didn&#8217;t want anything that would need the word &#8220;gut&#8221; in it. For the latter, as the saying goes, &#8220;famous last words&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Just when we were about to give up on our search, I decided to go to one last open house for a unit that had been on the market for months. Unbelievably, it was listed at a price that was within our budget and had three bedrooms, even larger than what we were originally hoping to get. It needed some work, but the maintenance was so low that we were convinced even with renovation costs, it would still be within our monthly budget.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The best part was thanks to an unusual catwalk outside the front door &#8212; the apartment actually received three exposures during the day and thus, a ton of light. But inside, it was similar to a “bento box” with lots of walls separating each of the living spaces and blocking all of that great light. The kitchen was dated and the whole thing needed to be gutted.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16388" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3797" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We posted our project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> after hearing from friends who had also found a general contractor on the website. We liked the ability to review candidates’ work online and we were extremely drawn to design-build companies for holistic decisions that would be more likely to contain costs. Sweeten introduced us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a> and I was hooked on their work. I loved the design of their projects and after speaking with their references, we hired them immediately. We were able to get a running start designing the kitchen with Paulina while we were still in the process of closing. As soon as we closed, Paulina&#8217;s group was able to go in and start demolition.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16389" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We went to see the apartment on the first day of demolition at the end of the day. As we stood there in the quiet dusk with the post-demolition dust slowly settling all around us, we both looked at each other with our mouths open…and in a moment of panic, I wondered if they could just put it all back the way it had been and pretend like nothing ever happened.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Once the debris cleared and the actual construction began, things were looking up. Bringing the dividing wall down between the kitchen and living room made a tremendous difference. Light poured in through the kitchen and into the hallways.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16393" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19.jpg" alt="upper west side kitchen renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Paulina and Albert custom-built the entire kitchen and it looks absolutely fantastic. We opted for classic white custom cabinets and we absolutely love the open shelving that Paulina incorporated per our request. The bookcase that transitions between the living room and kitchen was designed by her, and we love that it is a more natural ending point to the backsplash. Paulina persuaded us that wood countertops would require significant upkeep, so we opted instead for a simple quartz counter that has been great.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We tried to stay within our budget as much as possible and in doing so, decided to keep the perfectly fine (if dated) stove to hopefully be swapped out at a later date. Leon shopped with Paulina to find a narrower and more modern fridge and a new microwave that would match the width of the stove. Leon did the backlighting himself using an electronic LED strip that he controls through his phone. It can wirelessly connect and change colors to reflect the weather or the changes in the stock market. (<em>Editor’s note &#8212; ahem, what?? The stock market!?</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also went with a slightly more modern version of a rustic farmhouse sink and purchased our simple matte black pulls and handles from Ikea.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Our expert team was always professional during all of our interactions, even the ones when we were definitely playing the demanding and nervous first-time renovator role. I&#8217;m not sure we will ever do anything with the word &#8220;gut&#8221; in it again, but this was a great first-time renovating experience and we are so happy in our new home!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Karen and Kevin bought their Upper West Side co-op, they knew there was work to be done. To make the one-bedroom and one-bathroom ready for their family, they hoped to convert a small dining room nook into a nursery for their adorable daughter, Eleanor. Karen, an accountant in the hotel industry, and Kevin, a product manager at a software company, planned to do all renovations before moving in. Approvals took time, and the quest for a contractor stalled as some candidates balked at carving out the nursery space they envisioned. After interviewing several potential teams, Karen <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her apartment renovation project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and met their Sweeten general contractor, who didn’t bat an eye. “He really genuinely understood what we wanted and thought he could do it,” Karen said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/karen-and-kevins-apartment-renovation-sweeten-upper-west-side/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15499 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg" alt="karen's apartment renovation sweeten " width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen’s laminate counters and veneered cabinets were high on the list of issues, and the couple decided to tackle major bathroom grime as part of the overhaul. Karen and Kevin worked with their contractor to design a pocket door for the nursery, prepared to rehab an old windowsill, and planned to freshen up with new paint in a few spots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15500" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Karen's Kitchen Sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s team re-oriented the kitchen and removed a service door leftover from an earlier era. The new layout brought the opportunity to eke out more storage in every possible place—which meant custom cutting larger IKEA cabinets to fit the space. “We really wanted to max every inch we possibly could,” Karen said. But those extra inches came at a cost: time. “Custom cutting all of the cabinets was something we didn’t factor into the timeline.” Since the couple was commuting to see progress from where they were living in Red Hook, things often seemed slow, but the expanded storage turned out to be worth the wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep the sleek white lacquered cabinets from feeling too space age, Karen and Kevin picked a warm mosaic stone backsplash and a granite countertop from Brooklyn Granite. To keep costs down, Karen tried to snag as many of her Bosch appliances from out-of-state as possible to minimize sales tax. They installed undermount lighting and Karen’s favorite feature: a built-in filtering faucet that makes loading up a fridge filter a thing of the past.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom came with an extra long tub that was extra bulky and extra annoying. By removing the enormous 66-inch tub and replacing it with a standard-sized soaker, they made space for a larger, airy vanity with a drawer and storage underneath. “We picked the wood vanity to give it some warmth and more of a masculine feel,” Karen said. Karen was adamant about a recessed medicine cabinet with interior outlets, so gangly appliances like electric toothbrushes stayed out of site. The white subway tile also features it’s own storage niches in sleek black.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To continue the rustic-meets-minimalist vibe, the couple preserved the unfinished wood door, an original feature. After removing about “twenty layers of paint,” the door now opens and closes easily and the original crystal knob pops against the austere backdrop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15503 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15501 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15502" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Karen’s advice to fellow renovators stems from the botched delivery of three different toilets. Since the couple wasn’t living in the apartment during the renovation, there was a lapse before each mistake was discovered. “Our contractor warned me about this, make sure you order all the supplies and the contractor has them there right away so no one is waiting for things to arrive.” Karen and Kevin learned to allow and check for items to be on back-order or get delayed and to check deliveries as quickly as possible for accuracy and completeness.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Although navigating the renovation process combined with caring for a new baby was stressful, the family is thrilled with the results. “Little things popped up, but we dealt with them. There was nothing too crazy or too expensive, and that’s because of our contractor. We had a good working relationship,&#8221; Karen said.</p>
