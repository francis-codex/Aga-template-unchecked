										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>It’s versatile, durable, and looks good too</h2>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In renovation and design, there’s always a “hot” material or finish that somehow seems to be on everyone’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sweeten_home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>—and in everyone’s home. Right now, cement is having its moment, and while it may be trendy, the oft behind-the-scenes material is a timeless choice too. These renovators, who came to Sweeten to find general contractors, all used cement in their kitchen and bathroom projects.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38191 size-full" title="concrete walls" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="concrete walls in a bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mix of luxury and raw finishes turned </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/concrete-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karun’s once-crumbling prewar bathroom into an industrial-chic retreat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He wanted to align his bathroom with the rugged-meets-luxe style found in the rest of his home. The edginess of the unfinished, raw cement walls is balanced out with more polished elements such as bronze hardware and Carrara marble tiles.</span></p>

The concrete sink, which they designed and cast themselves, is one such example. In their otherwise traditional white bathroom with walls of subway tile, the concrete and wood sink adds rugged appeal. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Melissa-Flashman-Kitchen-04.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38476 size-full" title="wrap-around-floating-corner-shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Melissa-Flashman-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with flush pull handles and gray countertop with undermount sink and white square backsplash tiles and wrap around floating wooden corner shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Melissa-Flashman-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Melissa-Flashman-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Melissa-Flashman-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Melissa-Flashman-Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/mid-century-scandinavian-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first step to finding</a> (and honing) the light in this Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, kitchen was knocking down a wall. After that, choosing the right materials that reflect and refract natural light took priority. From the glossy, square subway tiles to the matte concrete countertops and floors, the renovator found the right mix of textures and color.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37560 size-full" title="concrete countertops" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-09.jpg" alt="concrete countertops in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-09-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-09-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>A Japanese-inspired aesthetic drove the vision for Sunghee and Joseph’s minimal 44-square-foot kitchen. To <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/44-square-foot-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complement their choices</a> of minimal hardware and two-tone wood cabinets, they went with the same material for the backsplash and countertops: concrete.</p>

Their home aesthetic especially comes through in their </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-renovation-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">master bathroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where more classic elements mingle with contemporary fixtures. In both spaces, they opted for concrete countertops that work well with the warm wood tones and mixed metals. </span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Refresh an old and outdated bathroom</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Penny, a product manager for a financial firm, and Kevin, a puppeteer with the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre, and their son, have lived in their over 100-year-old-plus co-op building for five years. They’ve been remodeling the Sunset Park, Brooklyn, apartment room by room, and until recently, waited on any major changes to the bathroom. They did, however, replace an old and “hideous” shower door with a curtain for a short-term fix. Once they were ready to bring the dingy space up to speed with their clean, simple style, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor.</a><strong><br />

</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: While they stuck to the original footprint, Penny and Kevin made one big change that had a big impact on the overall look of the bathroom: replacing the bathtub for a walk-in shower. “We spent most of our budget converting the old tub,” Penny shared. They were especially excited about the brand new glass door. A big priority for the couple was sourcing materials locally. When they went to select their wood-like porcelain tile floor at a nearby supplier, they found the light blue and white tiles from the same store. The hardware and major fixtures also come from a Brooklyn showroom close to their home.</p>

The only issue that came up during the renovation was a leak from an apartment upstairs. It was resolved, as the neighbor became more vigilant about making sure water didn’t escape from outside her shower curtain, though if it leaks again, the issue will have to be readdressed.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the biggest challenge was the division of labor between Penny, Kevin, and their contractor—especially since the family was out of town for the majority of the project. The couple divided responsibilities, with Penny taking on the budget and Kevin handling the aesthetic aspects. “He presented me with beautiful designs and then I approved or suggested how we could do things on a budget,” Penny said.</p>
<p>They coordinated with their general contractor mostly via email and phone calls. “His willingness to work with a neighbor, send emails, and call was really helpful,” Penny said. As an experienced renovator, she’s learned to be more trusting of a contractor’s advice, but also that it’s important to speak up about what you’re looking to achieve.  “Be clear on what you want, don’t give up on your design, but be flexible and listen to your contractor. You will be surprised on how that can help—they see a lot.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Penny also added these words of wisdom: “Go with the contractor that listens and seems pleasant to work with,” she said.<br />

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Welcome to #10 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p><em>Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a> with any reno questions or dilemmas you&#8217;d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: How much time should I set aside for selecting and ordering materials?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>The amount of time really depends on your selection process. When I go shopping, I like to be in and out of the store as soon as possible, but I have plenty of friends who spend a lot of time looking for the perfect pair of jeans. Start by considering how you shop in other areas of your life and how much time you like to spend researching and comparing prices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to choosing and deciding on materials on your own, it&#8217;s a good idea to communicate with your contractor on the product items you&#8217;re considering; different materials require different levels of labor. For example, a mosaic tile is harder to set and needs a much more skilled subcontractor than what a standard penny round tile would call for. To keep things running smoothly, it&#8217;s best to have everything ordered before the renovation begins. So, give yourself plenty of time to see what you like and keep your general contractor in the loop throughout the process.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to #2 in our series, Q&amp;A with Jean, in which I hope to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating. We hear your questions every day and work happily to bring you answers through our team and blog. Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings a new set of circumstances and new queries with it. Feel free to email me at JBrownhill@sweeten.com. In the meantime, I’ll even include questions that I get asked most often—even at cocktail parties!</p>
<p>Today our question is about the costs of home renovation in New York City; if this topic interests you, I&#8217;d suggest checking out our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bath</a> cost guides, including <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Budget Basics: Renovation Costs Per Square Foot</a>.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Why is renovating in New York City so expensive?</p>
<p><strong>JEAN:</strong> Like a lot of things in NYC, it comes down to logistics. For a general contractor to transport the drywall and studs—not mention the many other materials and tools necessary for the job—to your home, the planning can be really complicated. Not only does the team need to get everything to your apartment building, they need to get it up to your floor. Sometimes that means coordinating with an elevator, but in some cases, it can mean using a crane and craning in materials. What adds to the high cost of the materials part of a bid is the logistics.</p>
<p>The labor side of the equation is equally complicated. A lot of renovation projects going on simultaneously in the city and every contractor needs a tiler, a plumber, an electrician, etc. In order to survive the competition, he/she has to pay a premium to get a crew to show up at your job site. It all comes down to supply and demand. There are only so many skilled laborers in the city, and getting those laborers plus materials to your apartment can be challenging. Even for a house in Brooklyn, the crew still has to drive through traffic and bring the drywall from a warehouse that&#8217;s likely stationed in another borough, like Queens. Overall, it’s the cumulative expense of coordinating the drivers, trucks, and deliveries, plus having someone ready to accept deliveries and bring it to your home, that really drives up the cost.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Whether granite slabs or a full-on marble bathroom, natural stone offers durability, resistance to bacteria, and the flexibility to match every style</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20725 size-chrono" title="natural stone" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-723x496.jpg" alt="natural stone" width="723" height="496" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-723x496.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-300x206.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-600x412.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Laura and Peter&#8217;s bathroom features <a href="https://Sink, shower, wall and floor tiles in marble shower" target="_blank">floor-to-ceiling marble</a>, including radiant heat flooring</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">When it comes to the bathroom, nothing says luxury like real stone. Covering a wide price range, it makes it an easy go-to when designing the bath space. </span><span class="s1">Greater accessibility to quarries, wider distribution, and competition from dealers have all made this possible. An impervious (or nearly) surface also makes it suitable for almost every surface from walls, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank">floors</a>, countertops, and tub surrounds. Not all natural stone is alike, however. Some are more durable than others but with thoughtful attention to use and placement, you can enjoy this classic material in the bath. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choosing real stone</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Typically, the most common reason to choose one stone over another is to achieve a specific aesthetic,” says <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank">Sweeten contractor Phil</a>. “There are just some specific nuances that people look for that can only be found in a specific stone.”</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b></b>The most popular choice for stone in the bath is marble, thanks to its timeless appearance. Before you make your decision, consider other natural elements each with their own distinctive qualities. </span><span class="s1">Granite, travertine, and slate are all hard stones that hold up well to water in the bath, and each offers a particular look. Shop around as every slab is unique.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Think about where you would like to see it used. Will it be used to cover vertical and horizontal surfaces, or as an accent? If you’re working with a strict budget, you can enjoy a small application of stone, as a border around porcelain tile or behind the sink, or as a slab for the countertop. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Marble</span></span><span class="s2"> <b><br />
</b></span><span class="s1">A classic and versatile option, marble works in both traditional and contemporary settings. Distinguished by rich veins, it comes in many shades of white, as well as subtle grays, pale gold, and black. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Among the most popular are the white marbles: Calacatta and Carrara. The veins on Calacatta tend to be bolder than those on Carrara. Calacatta Gold, as its name indicates, includes gold-colored flecks. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Crema Marfil offers a creamier tone, almost like ivory. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Bardiglio is a deep gray stone with a blend of paler gray and black veins. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Nero Marquino is a black marble with white veins. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">All of these marbles take a polished or matte finish. On a floor, use a matte surface or a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/blueprint-comes-life-family-duplex/" target="_blank">mosaic</a>. The smaller pieces, with lots of grout lines, help prevent slipping.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Marble is one of the more porous materials. </span><span class="s1">If you use it in the bath, be prepared to seal it. Ask the fabricator to recommend a sealant product. “Homeowners can seal stone themselves, and there are many easy-to-use solutions on the market,” says Phil. Seal the stone first when it’s installed, and twice a year or so. “The frequency can vary due to use and location,” he says. </span><span class="s1">If you use it in the bath, be prepared to seal it several times a year, and you may have to tackle mildew if you place it in your shower pan, where water is likely to hit it daily.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Granite</span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b>For many years, granite was a favorite countertop for kitchens. <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s harder than most stones and nonporous so it can take moisture in the bath.</span> The pattern tends to be more granular than marble making it easier to coordinate with other designs. It comes in many more colors—whites, grays, and browns, as well as blues, greens, and reds. Install it as a slab as a countertop, or if you want to go all the way, apply slabs to the walls and tiles on the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Travertine</span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b>Like marble, travertine conjures luxury. Think ancient monuments and historic buildings (Sacré Coeur in Paris). The surface pattern combines subtle veins and fine granular patterns for a rustic look. Honed or tumbled finishes soften the effect. Colors range from cream or ivory to earthier golds and browns.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Slate</span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b>A fine-grained stone, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-gets-a-nordic-look-for-bathrooms-and-closets/" target="_blank">slate</a> comes in variations of blues, greens, browns, and grays for an elegant yet rustic look. When finished, it’s not as smooth as marble or granite. This makes it more naturally slip-resistant but still needs to be sealed.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Check for variations<br />
</b></span><span class="s1"><b><b><br />
</b></b></span>Stone is mined from a quarry, not manufactured, so each piece is unique. Color can vary by a lot, so if purchasing stone tile, ask to see the identification on all the boxes and be sure they go together. Buy an extra box in the case of repairs so the replacement tiles match.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Choose the finish</b></span></p>
<p>Marble and granite can take many different finishes—polished, honed, tumbled. There are a couple of new finish treatments called “leather” and “flamed” that polish the surface to a matte effect while playing up some of the grain.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Caring for your floors</b></span></p>
<p>Every natural stone requires sealing before it is installed and then periodically afterward. Frequency depends on the stone type and the amount of traffic received. If your bath sees activity every day, particularly from shoes, put down an area rug to catch grit and scuffs. Make sure the rug is rubber-backed so it doesn’t slip.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Consider the pros and cons</b></span></p>
<p>If you want natural, unique surfaces in the bath, stone makes a great choice.</p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• It resists water, bacteria, odor, and fire. Wet areas, like the shower, will require </span><span class="s1">a waterproof membrane underneath. Factor in regular maintenance, such as sealing. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• As hard as stone is, it’s also at risk from scratching, so lift furniture instead of sliding it, and sweep regularly to remove grit.  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• Cracking can occur without proper installation, so make sure your contractor prepares an even subfloor. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• <span style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing a damaged area can be difficult and costly. This is particularly true if the area is large. Play it safe with tiles or mosaic on the floor, where damage, if any, is more likely to occur from a dropped item. The smaller-sized tile and mosaics make it easier to replace a piece or two.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• Naturally cool, the material is a bonus in summer, but not so nice in winter on bare feet. Since natural stone transmits heat well, installing radiant heating before the tile is set may be a nice perk.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Faux stone and alternatives</b></span></p>
<p>With the recent refinements in high-definition printing, the look of stone is convincingly reproduced in porcelain tile. Porcelain is fired with a glaze making it impervious to water and less likely to scratch. This means it doesn’t have to be sealed regularly. At 3/8-inch thick, it’s also thinner and lighter than stone. The lighter weight makes it cheaper to ship, bringing down the cost.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Check out quartz, like Dekton and Caesarstone. This man-made material incorporates finely ground stone in a high-pressure manufacturing process to produce a surfacing material that is as hard as the real thing and claims to be impervious to stains </span><span class="s1">from liquids like wine and cooking oils. This super-hard quality requires less maintenance than real stone and contributes to the recent growth in popularity of quartz. Because it is a man-made material, you have more control over the appearance. </span><span class="s1">Manufacturers offer faux stone looks as well as the whitest whites, blackest blacks, and colors, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Stone in the bath is an investment of time and money. Your payback is a unique yet timeless look that, with a little attention to regular maintenance, will afford you with a room that you can enjoy for your lifetime.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Soundproofing walls and windows add a layer of acoustic luxury</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20390 size-full" title="soundproofing" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Soundproofing floors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>(Above) Deniz and Ramon&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/deniz-ramons-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproofed apartment</a> in Brooklyn</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Chances are, if you live in New York City, you’re used to the hustle and bustle of busy streets and vertical living. You’ve learned to sleep through that early morning garbage pick-up, and don’t even notice your upstairs neighbors’ scampering dog anymore. But “acoustic comfort”—as the experts say—is a very personal thing, and certain situations call for some measure of soundproofing to improve your space (for example, you live next to a 10-year construction project or there are six dogs upstairs instead of just one). </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">We consulted Stan Gatland II, an expert on the subject of acoustics and sound comfort at <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CertainTeed</a>, for the basic considerations on how to tackle noise issues and what solutions might work best for your circumstances.</span></p>
<h3>What are the sources of the noise pollution?</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">When it comes to noise pollution, Stan tells us that you can attempt to address the <b>source</b> of the noise—by asking the building’s board to talk to your neighbor, e.g.; you can have the <b>receiver</b> alter his or her behavior—from wearing earplugs to ultimately deciding to move to a different apartment. But given that these two options are not always feasible or desirable, you can aim to minimize noise by obstructing its <b>path</b>, which is how we arrive at soundproofing. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">An important note: Noise takes the path of least resistance, and can be transmitted in two ways. Determining how the sounds are transmitted is crucial to deciding which fixes to apply.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Airborne noise</b> can be either high- or low-frequency, such as your opera singer neighbor or the tuba player on your street corner.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Structure-borne or impact noise</b>, is usually low-frequency. Examples include vibrations from your building’s mechanical systems, a pet or child running in the apartment above, or a chair scraping the floor.</span></p>
<h3>How to reduce noise</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Once you’ve discovered the culprit—and it may be a combination of both airborne and impact noise—you can decide the types of solutions to employ. Airborne sound is usually dampened by adding layers of dense but flexible materials to the surface in question. Impact or structure-borne noise is a more complex matter requiring a professional to &#8220;break&#8221; or minimize the connections between transmission points, usually by adding gaps in the home’s structure (explained below). Some of the major ways to cut the clamor:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Make sure your home is airtight</b></span></span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The level of airtightness will do wonders for your noise problems. On windows, consider double- or triple-pane, as well as weather stripping and caulking, to fill any spaces that sound may travel through. For doors, solid core is best (check out <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">this Sweeten post</span></a> to learn more), and acoustic seals can be applied to the threshold and around the perimeter of the door to fill the gaps. Don’t forget about the small and often overlooked problem areas—such as doorbells, light sockets, and outlets—which are all sound paths. Recessed lighting is a particular offender. Make sure everything is enclosed, capped, and sealed. A tiny gap can amplify the noise exponentially.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>“Float” your walls, ceilings, and floors</b></span></span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Disconnecting the drywall layer from the framing is the best way to address impact noise and reduce airborne sound transmission, and can be done by suspending walls, ceiling, and floors via various methods, says Stan. One way is to add “resilient channels,” essentially metal channels that separate the drywall from the studs so that there are fewer points of connectivity. Another way is by using specially engineered drywall, such as <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SilentFX® QuickCut</a> noise-reducing drywall, a CertainTeed product that uses a viscoelastic polymer between two specially formulated dense gypsum cores that produces the same effect as resilient channels. Floating floors and ceilings use a similar technology to minimize the connections.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Add more insulation and absorptive materials</b></span></span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">&#8220;Light, porous materials are best for absorbing noise, and these can be applied on the surface of the drywall as well as within,&#8221; explains Stan. Often, clay or metal gets mixed into vinyl to create more heft in these acoustic barriers. Additional drywall layers can be helpful too, as can widening the spacing between studs, or using metal rather than wooden ones. In terms of insulation, fibrous materials are best, since they offer the best aspect of trapped air. New constructions will typically have concrete slabs between the floors, which is a great sound dampener. </span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">But fear not—even if you don’t have concrete slabs, there are less involved ways of adding layers to absorb sound. You can add acoustical ceiling tile or wall panel systems to the surfaces in the room. Layering soft materials, such as a tapestry on the walls, thick carpets and drapes, upholstered furniture, and even lush plants will help to reduce noise echo. Placing a shelving unit full of books next to the wall you share with a loud neighbor will also be effective in reducing sound transmission through the adjoining surface. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Can soundproofing be eco-friendly? </span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The measures you take to address sound minimization may also help with energy efficiency and climate control. For example, airtightness and added insulation will guide you toward achieving both goals. As for the materials themselves, most insulation is now low- or no-VOC, and many no longer include formaldehyde. You could go even greener by using <span class="s2"><a href="https://hemptechglobal.com/page15/styled-29/page116.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hemp</a> or</span> <span class="s2"><a href="https://www.goodshepherdwool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wool</a> in place of typical fiberglass insulation. </span> Shredded blue jeans is also a recyclable material used as insulation. These options are typically more expensive for the same effect, however.  </span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>How much does it cost to sound proof?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Now that you’ve had a crash course in soundproofing, it’s time to get started! If you have a simple problem, such as hallway noise coming through your front door, you can resolve it for a few hundred dollars by purchasing an <a href="https://acousticalsolutions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">acoustic door seal kit</span></a> and asking your super to install it. Unfortunately, more extensive problems require specialized expertise, and it may be worth your while to commission a sound analysis or diagnosis report from an acoustics expert. Every situation is different and a pro can help you determine the source and paths of your sound issues, plus suggest appropriate solutions. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">You’ll need to decide how deep a retrofit you are willing to undergo, what kind of budget you have, and how much you&#8217;re willing to be inconvenienced; all are variables that will factor into the solutions an expert suggests. Extensive retrofitting, which will require you to move out of your home, will range from $50 to $80 dollars per square foot for walls, while ceilings and floors will run you $70 to $110 per square foot. Soundproofing can be a complicated process, but to some, silence is golden.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">—</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Planning to add shelves to your home? <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A custom built-in</a> will help dampen noise, taking care of storage and improving soundproofing all in one go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b></b>Here’s how to keep key materials—from countertops to appliances—performing at tip top</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">As your <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/">home renovation</a> draws to a close, you may experience feelings of relief and joy at the transformation from the old to the new. Decisions on materials turned out to be good choices, and daily life is now blending and flowing around your new space. Aftercare may be the last thing on your mind, or you may find yourself wondering: &#8220;How do I keep my newly renovated space looking great for years to come?&#8221;. Here are five ways to care for your new home.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="Range with white tile backsplash and open shelving" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56349" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Consult manufacturers’ manuals for appliance care</strong></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">An obvious first renovation aftercare step that many homeowners skip. Most appliance manufacturers have a place on their webpage dedicated to manuals or product service and support. A model number will lead you to literature on cleaning and maintenance. Often, a simple Google search is enough. For example, a stainless wine refrigerator requires little attention except for periodically washing off fingerprints. This can be done with water and mild dish soap, then polished with a microfiber cloth dipped in mineral, cooking or olive oil. Note: Clean and polish with the grain. Look closely! Steel has grain just like wood. Here are extra tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://amzn.to/44JR5ag">Weiman Stainless Steel Wipes or Liquid Spray</a> work great</li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Register major appliances with the manufacturer through their website.</li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Make sure you know the model numbers for future reference &#8212; often they are on the back of the machine so take a picture or write it down for future reference.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speak with your contractor about how to maintain your equipment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Candid shot of Lia in her kitchen renovated with Sweeten" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56288" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Safeguard your kitchen countertops</strong></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">You probably reviewed pros and cons of different materials before you made your final decision of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/popular-types-of-kitchen-countertops/">kitchen countertops</a>. Ready to start cooking? Here’s a refresh!</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><strong>Quartz countertops</strong>, such as <a href="https://www.caesarstoneus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caesarstone</a>, are durable, non-porous and do not need to be annually resealed, but acidic foods or juices can erode the acrylic. This material is also more likely to be damaged by excessive heat than granite, crushed glass or concrete. Treat yourself to trivets.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Porous natural stones</strong>, such as granite and marble, may need to be resealed periodically and are susceptible to stains from oils and acids. Don’t let spilled liquids sit on your stone countertops. Spill? Swipe! Accidents happen &#8212; <a href="https://amzn.to/44LtExe">this etch remover</a> can be a lifesaver</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Laminate or solid-surfacing countertops</strong>, in this case, renovation aftercare means cutting boards are mandatory because both of these materials are easily scratched.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09.webp" alt="Shower with green and white patterned tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57255" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Tend to your tiles</strong></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-popular-bath-tiles-and-how-much-they-cost/">Bathroom tiles</a> get hazy with soapy residue, while kitchen backsplashes get splattered with oil, and floor tiles experience both! Regular cleaning will prevent the need to muscle through buildup, so break out a mild all-purpose cleaner and some basic cleaning equipment.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">For kitchen backsplash tiles, mix dish liquid with water and rub away the oily residue with a sponge or gentle cloth. White vinegar mixed with warm water is another option. A mild all-purpose cleaner will clean up bath tiles nicely. Mix the solution with water and wipe with a rag, a soft brush or sponge.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Sweep or vacuum floor tiles of any debris and grit on a regular basis to avoid dulling or scratching the surface. After clearing away large particles, use a mop and bucket with mild soap or detergent and warm water. If you wind up with a hazy film, consider switching up your mop material (sponge to chamois, for example) and/or wipe away the film with a fresh cloth and an all-purpose cleaner.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Seal your grout! Where there is tile, there is grout. <a href="https://amzn.to/3EusDPF">Use a sealant like this one</a>. For renovation aftercare for your grout, use gentle brushes to scrub it clean. And if your regular tile cleaning routine is not doing the trick on your grout, try a paste of baking soda and water, a mild bleach solution or store-bought grout cleaner. Remember to reseal grout periodically.</li>

<h3><strong>4. Work with your wood</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Refinished or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brand new hardwoods</a> can be beautiful foundations for your home. If you are the type of family that takes off your shoes before entering the home, you are off to a great start! Even if not, caring for your floors can be easy with a few simple guidelines.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Begin your flooring renovation aftercare by placing indoor and outdoor welcome mats. Mats placed before and after the threshold of your door are an important first step in maintaining scratch- and stain-free floors even in the winter.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Area rugs cut down on regular wear and tear on the floors in the areas where they are positioned.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Little felt stickers (<a href="https://amzn.to/3Z7SqXp">like these</a>) do a good job protecting your floors from furniture-driven scratches.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are a few rules of thumb when cleaning your floors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sweep or vacuum debris on a regular basis</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Mop with water and a gentle soap and never leave water or other liquids sitting on your hardwoods. Water can eventually penetrate the finish and leave stains in the wood. If you are not sure what cleaner to use on your floors, manufacturers of wood sealants often offer hardwood floor cleaners, such as <a href="https://amzn.to/3RcK4vs">Minwax® Hardwood Floor Cleaner</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Laura-pantry-09-scaled.gif" alt="Moving image off renovator in custom cabinets" width="1706" height="2560" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57343" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Care for your cabinets</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although you likely will not be cleaning your kitchen or bathroom cabinets as often as higher-traffic surfaces (such as shower tiles and cooking countertops), don’t forget about them!  </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Knobs and pulls can harbor germs and cabinet doors can become grimy over time from moisture and oils in the air. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Similarly to hardwood floors, wooden cabinets don’t do well with water or other liquids resting on their surface.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1">Whether you clean your cabinets with soapy water, white vinegar water or mild all-purpose cleaner, remember these vital last steps: wipe away cleaner residue with a wet cloth and dry your cabinets with a towel.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>Feeling stuck in your renovation? Look to the stars for inspiration</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your home needs a renovation, and you’re not sure where to start, why not consult the celestial bodies for some answers? Whether your sign is connected to fire, water, earth or air, each element leans toward certain colors, styles, or texture preferences. In order to prepare you for what lies ahead, we’ve compiled the best materials and techniques for each of the 12 zodiac signs. Read on to reveal what the stars say about your renovation.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20275 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03-1-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><br />

<p><strong>Aquarius</strong> (January 20-February 18)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Air</p>
<p>You prefer to keep things open, so having fewer partitioned rooms should be the first thing on your punch list. Connecting your living spaces, like your dining and living room, is a great way to create an airy and inviting home.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22289 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Cybele_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="Kitchen with turquoise subway tile backsplash" width="723" height="482" /><br />
<span class="img-label">A <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchen-goes-low-maintenance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen renovation</a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><strong>Pisces</strong> (February 19-March 20)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Water</p>
<p>You&#8217;re someone with a big imagination who prefers the path of least resistance. Surrounding yourself with brightly colored and glossy materials will provide endless inspiration to keep your creativity flowing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20746 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
<span class="img-label">A <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom renovation</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><strong>Aries</strong> (March 21-April 19)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Fire</p>
<p>You have a strong sense of self and you like to put your own stamp on things. Texture and color combined can create a bold look and let you stand out from the rest of the pack.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22374 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-02" width="723" height="482" /><br />
<span class="img-label">A <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen renovation</a> in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><strong>Taurus</strong> (April 20-May 20)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Earth</p>
<p>One might say you’re bullheaded, but that’s just another way of saying that you have strong opinions, which is a good thing when it comes to design. With an inclination towards keeping things simple, incorporating natural materials like soapstone into your home is the way to go.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22279 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-05_Crop-723x492.jpg" alt="Open shelving in white and wood kitchen" width="723" height="492" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-05_Crop-723x492.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-05_Crop-300x204.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-05_Crop-600x409.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-05_Crop.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />

<p><strong>Gemini</strong> (May 21-June 20)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Air</p>
<p>You’re someone who’s unpredictable and lives for variety, so it only makes sense that you’d want to keep things open to the winds of change. Open shelving lets you mix things up, switching out your display with each passing season or mood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22296 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_HenryApt-05_Crop-723x506.jpg" alt="Modern bathroom with silver accents" width="723" height="506" /><br />

<p><strong>Cancer</strong> (June 21-July 22)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Water</p>
<p>As a careful planner who prefers to keep things consistent, you’re not one to rock the boat. Try rippled tile for an effect that suggests flowing water to help you keep your cool.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22106 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-723x506.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="506" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-723x506.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-300x210.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-600x420.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />

</strong><strong><br />
Leo</strong> (July 23-August 22)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Fire</p>
<p>Your sign displays a lot of confidence and pride, and you find yourself always wanting to be the center of attention. Nothing says &#8220;look at me!&#8221; like a saturated pop of color. An accent wall in Hamilton Blue can be a conversation-starter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20687 mb-10 size-chrono" title="nursery renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-13.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />

<p><strong>Virgo</strong> (August 23-September 22)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Earth</p>
<p>As someone who is well-organized and prefers order and balance, you feel a connection with the natural world. Custom shelving can add order and a sense of calm to any room.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22286 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Anne_Kitchen-02_Crop-723x508.jpg" alt="Galley kitchen with cutout" width="723" height="508" /><br />
<span class="img-label">A <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/annes-sweetened-willow-street-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/">kitchen renovation</a> in Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><strong>Libra</strong> (September 23-October 22)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Air</p>
<p>You&#8217;re level-headed, and having your home be in harmony is very important to you. A cutout can connect your living spaces, bridging the gap between separate rooms to let them harmonize with one another.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22375 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-05-1-723x509.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="509" /><br />

<p><strong>Scorpio</strong> (October 23-November 21)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Water</p>
<p>Some might say you&#8217;re intense, and you often find yourself laser-focused on the next task in front of you. High-gloss and reflective finishes around your home can keep you in touch with the world around you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20411 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-1-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />

<p><strong>Sagittarius</strong> (November 22-December 21)<br />
Element: Fire</p>
<p>You’re a confident, straightforward person who doesn&#8217;t need to embellish your home to feel good about yourself. Soft hues, like this wall color in Gobi Desert, can be a great way to reflect that self-assuredness.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22291 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-08_Crop-723x506.jpg" alt="Modern kitchen with granite countertop" width="723" height="506" /><br />

<p><strong>Capricorn</strong> (December 22-January 19)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Air</p>
<p>You&#8217;re a master of self-discipline with a penchant for realism. When it comes to designing your home, granite is a solid choice that will stand the test of time.</p>
