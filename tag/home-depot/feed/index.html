			<h2>IKEA is a go-to brand for kitchen cabinets—but what about retailers like Home Depot, Lowe&#8217;s, and Cabinets To Go?</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-11.jpg" alt="dining room and kitchen IKEA Home Depot Lowe's Cabinets To Go" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35026" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-11-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Many homeowners who want modern, well-built kitchen cabinets eventually end up at IKEA. For starters, IKEA&#8217;s cabinets are reasonably priced, well-designed, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/ikea-kitchen-cabinets-everything-renovators-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last for a long time</a>. However, IKEA is not the only place to buy cabinets. Here, Sweeten compares how Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Cabinets To Go offer services and cabinets similar to IKEA’s—sometimes with competing prices.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3>IKEA vs. Home Depot and Lowe’s stores</h3>
<p>Home Depot and Lowe’s are large, general-category home improvement stores offering a wide range of home goods. Though they are different companies, they are similar in many ways, especially for kitchen cabinets.</p>
<p>Home Depot and Lowe’s are well-represented in the U.S., each with about 2,000 stores and locations in every state. The number of stores is beneficial: most shoppers can reach a Home Depot or a Lowe’s within an hour or less. By contrast, IKEA has around 50 U.S. stores, which are clustered in large metro areas— and some areas have no IKEA store at all! Unless you are purely shopping for online kitchen cabinets (known as RTA or ready-to-assemble), it is important to visit a store to view cabinet samples in person.</p>
<p>Most Home Depot and Lowe’s stores have a kitchen design center or a desk that is open during daytime hours. This expert can help a shopper plan for and purchase kitchen cabinets. One drawback: because the desks are typically located in the center of the store, it can be loud and hard to focus. It’s much the same way at an IKEA store. For all of these stores, it’s best to visit during the evenings and weekdays for more personal attention.</p>
<h3>What stores have in-stock cabinet options?</h3>
<h4>IKEA&#8217;s stocked warehouses</h4>
<p>IKEA stores are huge. One reason they are so big is that they have attached warehouses. These warehouses carry nearly all of the kitchen cabinets in stock. In fact, when you buy IKEA cabinets, you can take them home immediately, as long as you have a means of transport (IKEA also has a delivery service).</p>
<p>Because IKEA stores are so large, more space can be devoted to the kitchen section. This means that you will find a large number of full-scale kitchen displays at IKEA. You can test-drive the cabinets by opening doors and drawers. Home Depot and Lowe’s stores may have as many as four or five full-scale kitchen displays, but often less.</p>
<p>Because IKEA aims to keep kitchen cabinets in stock, it cannot carry a large selection. IKEA has 24 different kitchen cabinet styles. These 24 cabinet styles revolve around a single-core cabinet system: SEKTION. Any one of those 24 cabinet styles can be applied to the SEKTION component system. Most cabinet styles lean towards solid colors such as white, gray, green, beige, or black. IKEA also has wood-effect melamine veneer cabinets and a few natural wood veneer cabinets.</p>
<h4>A wider selection of styles</h4>
<p>If you need cabinets now, Home Depot and Lowe’s both have a number of in-stock cabinets on the shelves. For Home Depot, this means its house brand, Hampton Bay. For Lowe’s, it’s the Project Source and Diamond NOW brands. The selection of in-stock cabinets at both stores is far less than those found in IKEA’s large warehouses.</p>
<p>Home Depot and Lowe’s offer a far wider selection of cabinet styles than IKEA. The types of styles include those found at IKEA, plus many more. Home Depot and Lowe’s, too, have full-wood ½ inch plywood cabinets available for special order. They also carry fiberboard box cabinets that are similar to IKEA’s.</p>
<p>Delivery time at Home Depot and Lowe’s for its stock cabinets is around 7 to 10 days. Estimated lead times for semi-custom cabinets is 14 to 30 days. IKEA’s delivery times are shorter: 4 to 13 days.</p>
<h3>IKEA vs. Cabinets To Go</h3>
<p>Cabinets To Go is a home design center with 75 locations throughout the U.S.; mostly around the East Coast and in the South.</p>
<p>Shopping for cabinets at Cabinets To Go is completely different from shopping at IKEA, Home Depot, or Lowe’s. A Cabinets To Go store is services-oriented and carries no stock. The purpose of Cabinets To Go stores is to bring homeowners together with design experts. In contrast, IKEA, Home Depot, and Lowe’s are goods-oriented stores that also offer a kitchen services component.</p>
<p>Cabinets To Go is focused on <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/full-wall-kitchen-cabinets-an-expanding-trend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen and bathroom cabinets</a>, plus supporting items such as counters, sinks, and flooring. While IKEA also is home-centric, it includes many other types of house goods. The focus at Home Depot and Lowe’s is even broader, carrying everything from cabinets to lumber, housewares, carpet, and paint.</p>
<h4>If you want a personal shopping experience</h4>
<p>Compared to IKEA’s large stores, Cabinets To Go stores are much smaller. There is some walk-in traffic at Cabinets To Go, but most shoppers visit during scheduled appointments. Because of this, the stores can feel more personal and relaxed.</p>
<p>Despite their size, Cabinets To Go stores usually have a fair number of mock full or partial kitchens. Appointments with a kitchen expert may include looking at those mock-ups. You&#8217;ll use most of the appointment time to go through sample doors and drawer fronts. During your visit, the expert will also work up a 3D plan.</p>
<h4>Styles of cabinets and box construction</h4>
<p>Cabinets To Go’s 18 custom stock cabinets styles mostly differ from IKEA’s slab or bevel-front cabinets. Cabinets To Go does have a number of modern-style cabinets. But most styles are Shaker-style or raised-panel, for a more classic look. For even more choices, Cabinets To Go’s custom cabinet line provides over 160 door styles and more than 60 paints and stains.</p>
<p>Cabinets To Go’s box construction, too, is different. IKEA’s cabinet boxes are fiberboard overlaid in melamine foil. Cabinet to Go’s box frames are solid birch with a ¾-inch birch center, with sides covered in wood veneer.</p>
<p>Cabinets To Go&#8217;s cabinets are shipped to your local store for you to pick up for free. Or the cabinets may be shipped directly to your home at extra cost. For any cabinet brand, delivery leads are two to three weeks, an estimate that varies according to cabinet selection and the store.</p>
<h3>Stock and pre-fabricated cabinets: IKEA, Home Depot, Lowe&#8217;s, and Cabinets To Go</h3>
<p>Widely available across the country, these large retailers are price-smart go-to&#8217;s for kitchen renovators. Plus, in these affordable price categories, your budget may even go further! <span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <span class="s2">renovate with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best vetted contractors</a></span>.</span></p>

<h3>Popular questions asked</h3>
<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to redo kitchen cabinets</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">There are a few ways to refresh kitchen cabinets, depending on how much time, money, and effort you want to put in. Swapping out knobs/drawer pulls is the lowest-cost, lowest-effort way to refresh cabinets. Painting cabinets with a bold jewel tone or matte shade is another common refresh tactic. More involved methods involve swapping out cabinet doors, using a custom-fronts provider like <a href="https://www.semihandmade.com/">Semihandmade</a>, or doing a complete rip-and-replace to fully replace your cabinet boxes and doors.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064501783">
<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much do new kitchen cabinets cost?</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Stock kitchen cabinets, commonly found in stores like Home Depot and IKEA, are the cheapest option, at roughly $60/ linear foot. Semi-custom cabinets, coming in a greater range of sizes and styles, cost roughly $90/ linear foot and up. Custom cabinets, the most expensive, cost $200 – $500/ linear foot, and are carried by brands like Poggenpohl, Bilotta, and Henrybuilt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Marble tiles, a sleek pocket door, and new laundry facilities round out this Upper East Side bathroom</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-laura-and-peters-uptown-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14709 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/laurabathroom.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/laurabathroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/laurabathroom-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Laura and Peter bought their one-bedroom, one-bathroom co-op on Manhattan’s Upper East Side in 2013. During the apartment hunt, this arts professional and consultant pair decided they really wanted a home with an in-unit washer and dryer. Some buildings allowed washers and dryers and some did not. Still others had flip-flopped on the­­­ matter altogether: buildings that once allowed in-unit washers and dryers later changed their minds—grandfathering in appliances installed before the change while banning newcomers from adding them. When Laura and Peter sealed the deal on their new place in a building that allowed laundry appliances, the hustle was on to install a set pronto, before any potential shift down the road.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>“Our expert team was so helpful &#8212; Ed and Valeria did a lot of really beautiful work and were easy to get in touch with while we weren&#8217;t living there. Ed was excellent about working with our building and super and they both helped with photos and phone calls whenever we had delivery issues, which was often.”<span id="more-14708"></span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><em>&#8212; Laura, Upper East Side homeowner</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laura and Peter eyed a hallway closet as the future home of their laundry nook, but the plan took on a choose your own adventure angle as the couple needed help to determine whether the work might necessitate opening the walls in the kitchen or bath, both adjacent to the laundry spot. Laura was also plagued by the daily reminder that the bathroom had no nearby heat source. With floor-to-ceiling travertine tiles, it felt like a Tuscan-inspired igloo on chilly mornings. Plus, the extra-wide pedestal sink put the shower tap just out of her reach – an unfortunate design flaw in an otherwise compact room. Laura <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted the project on Sweeten</a> and we introduced Sweeten Experts Valeria and Eduard, owners of a Brooklyn design-build firm, to make this all work. Valeria and Eduard cut through the walls to make the call that the new laundry closet would share water access with the bathroom, meaning game on for a full bathroom renovation!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14714" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-Before-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-Before-05" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-Before-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-Before-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14858" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Laura_Closet-01_04-copy.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Laura_Closet-01_04 copy" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Laura_Closet-01_04-copy.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Laura_Closet-01_04-copy-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laura drew inspiration from the iconic black and white tile in so many bathrooms she toured while apartment-hunting. In went white marble floor tiles accented with miniature black diamond tiles, all from <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>. This ageless flooring masks a big-time modern improvement: radiant floor heating lies just underneath and is connected to a timer that gets the heat going every morning. Laura and Peter continued a luxe look up the walls with 12” marble square tiles, a subtle rounded tile border, and custom marble shower shelves, all with materials found at <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom gained a sleek pocket door (with beautifully crafted custom molding created by Eduard) and Laura found a console sink that combined the look of an old-fashioned marble sink with more modern chrome lines. The couple found multiple ways to echo these clean lines with a simple squared  <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler tub</a> and sliding glass doors, European-inspired <a href="https://www.americanstandard-us.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Standard shower fixtures</a>, a dual-flush toilet from <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler</a>, and a deco lighting fixture sourced from Lighting District. Valeria and Eduard also made room for a <a href="https://shop.panasonic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Panasonic</a> ceiling fan and side-by-side <a href="https://www.robern.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robern medicine cabinets</a>, both mirrored inside and out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All together, the new space is brighter and warmer than ever before. And the washer and dryer that started it all? The contractors transformed the interior of the hallway closet with blue-gray paint and stacked a white <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bosch washer and dryer</a> next to revamped hallway linen storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello again from Crown Heights! We were treated to a summer tour of Colin and Orli&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/colin-and-orlis-sweetened-crown-heights-work-studio-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">super creative work studio</a> and we&#8217;re back this week for a full look at the new bathroom, kitchen, and living room in their two bedroom co-op. This scenic and costume designer pair is no stranger to creating transporting spaces and pieces for the theater, but they needed heavy duty help to deal with five layers of rotting floor tiles in the bathroom and fire damage hidden behind the kitchen walls. We dispatched a Sweeten expert for huge overhauls in both rooms and for custom replica and restoration work throughout the apartment, and we were so intrigued by the possibilities in this unique space that we took identical sets of before, during, and after photos that reveal how much work went into re-creating this home. Read on through for the full story.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="diningroom-hardwood-floors-kitchen-with-walnut-cabinets" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47788 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt.jpg" alt="photo of dining room with hardwood floors and crown molding and trims and another photo of kitchen with black granite countertop and walnut cabinets and tile floors after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-14162"></span>Colin and Orli knew they had a major project on their hands before closing on the place. The most significant demolition was needed in the bathroom, which had accumulated five different layers of floor tiles, all glued down over each other through multiple renovation attempts spanning decades. The extra floor heft was especially obvious when you stepped down into the tub &#8211; the unexpected drop was enough to catch a visitor off guard. Water damage and rotting materials extended throughout the room and down through the floorboards and joists. Pedro&#8217;s team needed to replace some of the studs, level the joists, and work through plumbing all the way back to the building&#8217;s stacks. In the kitchen, the couple intended to keep the general footprint, but uncovered fire damage from a previous tenant inside the walls. Studs with char marks, several layers of cracked flooring, and non-level sub-flooring required structural work before the fun fixtures and appliances could come anywhere near the place.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="dark-green-square-bathroom-wall-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47793 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orili-Bathroom-After.jpg" alt="bathroom with dark green square wall tiles and walk in shower with glass dors and toilet after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orili-Bathroom-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orili-Bathroom-After-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orili-Bathroom-After-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Colin and Orli came up big with two distinctive tile choices in the bathroom. They headed straight for the unfailingly classic and vintage appeal of black and white hex tiles, and picked up a case of each at <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/c/Bathroom_Tile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>. The path to new wall tile was not quite as direct &#8211; the couple admittedly agonized over finding the right color &#8211; something that would be saturated and bright, luminous and with a hand-painted feel. With a Starbucks-green glaze in mind, they found exactly what they wanted in a ceramic tile at <a href="https://www.completetile.com/products/ceramic/mcintones_ceramics/ceramic_tile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complete Tile</a>. Complete Tile also nailed all of the possible tile configurations, allowing Pedro and his team to work with rounded bullnose, chair rail, and corner tiles all in the same coordinating hues. To save the bathroom from future water damage, they picked up a new tub and fully enclosed it with tile and a sliding glass door. Pedro installed a <a href="https://www.thomasvillecabinetry.com/inspiration-gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomasville</a> vanity topped with granite from <a href="https://www.countertopsnewyorkcity.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bright Granite</a> and fixtures from <a href="https://www.faucetdirect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faucet Direct</a>, where they also found their new eco-flush toilet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, Colin and Orli selected ceramic floor tiles that mimic a slate feel with organic color variation (many tiles in this style have texture or color variation that is digitally printed on top, but not these). They ordered <a href="https://www.thomasvillecabinetry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomasville cabinetry</a> from Home Depot in a whiskey black finish, which gives the kitchen a weathered, craftsman feel. They found the cabinet hardware on <a href="https://www.build.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Build.com</a>, whose order and return policy made it easy to directly compare more than a dozen finishes. The new countertop has become a deeply loved piece &#8211; at the <a href="https://www.countertopsnewyorkcity.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bright Granite</a> shop, it was covered in a layer of dust and didn&#8217;t reveal it&#8217;s rich blue, green, and black translucent depth until it arrived for installation. All the appliances are from <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AJ Madison</a>: the stove is a <a href="https://www.frigidaire.com/Kitchen-Appliances/Ranges/Gas-Range/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fridgidaire</a> 5-burner, the fridge is <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a> with french doors which leave just enough room to swing open in the galley, and the modern sink faucet is <a href="https://www.moen.com/kitchen/sinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moen</a>. To finish the look, Colin and Orli wrapped the room in an antique silver gloss tin backsplash tile from <a href="https://www.americantinceilings.com/shop-backsplashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Tin Ceiling Company</a>. They managed the faux finish on the walls themselves using a basic rag roll glazing technique (but substituting lace for the rag) and finishing things off with a soft blending brush, using a similar technique that was used in the living room.  The barn light above the dining area is from <a href="https://www.barnlight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barn Light Electric</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the apartment, Pedro sanded and finished the floors to preserve the original wood and inlay border with a high gloss luster. To conceal the steam heat pipe in the living room corner, Pedro boxed out the section and added a decorative grill from <a href="https://aagrilles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Architectural Grills</a>. While the work in the living room was largely cosmetic, Colin and Orli are grateful to Pedro for his painstaking replicas of much of the building&#8217;s original details. Pedro custom-built the floating shelves to carry the same ornate lines of the picture rail molding. He was also able to largely match the trim molding that had previously existed with support from Dyke&#8217;s Lumber. However, since the door and window casements were not available off the rack, he went the extra mile and personally cut hundreds of feet of trim material to match the original art deco detail Colin and Orli loved.</p>

			<h2>A Manhattan apartment undergoes a renovation that creates an elegant bathroom and spacious kitchen</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-52329 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04.jpg" alt="two-tone-bathroom-with-glass-shower" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

</ul>
<p><em><span class="s1">Written in partnership with homeowner Megha</span></em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Ready for a refresh</h3>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Megha&#8217;s architect hired a Sweeten general contractor to execute her architectural plans that called for big changes throughout the kitchen and living areas. The condo’s original layout was all sliced up. With the kitchen walled off from the entry and living room, there was a less-than-helpful pass-through cut-out. The master bathroom was falling apart. The finishes that once looked new were peeling and rickety, and the separate shower and bath set-up was under-utilized. Megha loved the apartment, but was ready for changes that would open things up.</p>
<div></div>
<ul></ul>
<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Breaking down walls to create an open floor plan</h3>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">The Sweeten contracting team broke down all the walls between the foyer and the living room. This move had the dual effect of creating a huge, open-plan living room, while making the kitchen the social center of the new space. Megha did a ton of research on cabinetry options. Ultimately, she went for a hybrid of custom cabinet bases with white lacquered doors and pulls. She said that the new cabinets are like “night and day” compared to the ones they replaced. The cabinet surfaces feel sturdy and the drawer and cabinet inserts bring amazing variety in storage space.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-52330 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-05.jpg" alt="two toned kitchen with bar stools" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 wp-image-52333 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-06.jpg" alt="White kitchen with grey accents " width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Megha went with a gray quartz countertop molded and poured into polished slabs, then installed waterfall edges that house each section of the new kitchen cabinets. The gas pipe in the kitchen bisected the new island, but her contractor joined two separate counter slabs seamlessly. This left a smooth gray surface that contrasts well against the white and pine finishes in the room.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 wp-image-52332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-07.jpg" alt="Two toned kitchen with silver fixtures and faucet" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Megha decided to go big in one tiny place—splurging on marble backsplash tiles. Even though it shocked Megha when she realized how expensive a few square feet of tile could be, she was obsessed with the natural veining of the marble in the geometric herringbone pattern.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-52326 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-08.jpg" alt="two tone kitchen with stainless steel appliances" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Hidden luxuries</h3>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Megha highlighted three favorite aspects of the new kitchen. The Sweeten contractor installed a recessed outlet on the surface of the island that pops up when in use and vanishes when nothing is plugged in. The plan also called for a sink disposal fixture with a hidden button integrated in the countertop being virtually invisible. A custom dining bench extends from the kitchen to create a dining area.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-52327 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-09.jpg" alt="two toned kitchen with purple accent wall" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The contracting team replaced the unit’s flooring with a moderately priced white-stained wood. Megha’s appliance picks include a downdraft stove, a stainless steel fridge, and microwave installed with custom cabinet panels. Overlooking this space are three shelf niches. When the contractor was asked for some inventive storage and display space, he designed and crafted this set-up himself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-52331 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-11.jpg" alt="kitchen gas range in grey island countertop" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A dazzling new bathroom</h3>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">In the bathroom, Megha went straight for a look that had five-star hotel spa aesthetic. Textured gray porcelain tiles line the trim, and ta pebbled tile made for a natural-looking shower floor. Megha&#8217;s Sweeten contractor also lined the shower walls with white glass tiles and a green-gray grout toning down the gloss. Megha spent hours searching for the perfect sink vanity and was astonished to find that nothing on the market felt right. Instead of spending time and money on a vision that just didn’t exist, Megha went custom. She chose a piece that combines white lacquered drawers with a cabinet, and a quartz countertop and fixtures.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-52336 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-01.jpg" alt="two tones bathroom bright" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Megha chose a full-wall custom mirror lined with Broadway lights, a real turnaround for a bathroom that previously had dim, yellow lighting. The good news here is that Megha’s new bathroom is most definitely spa-like.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-52335 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-03.jpg" alt="Two toned bathroom vanity" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-02.jpg" alt="two toned bathrrom with white toliet" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-52334 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Megha&#8217;s renovation resulted in a beautiful bathroom and a kitchen including an open and unifying layout into the dining and living area. With Sweeten&#8217;s help, Megha was able to create and more unifying space with light and elegance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Here’s a primer on kitchen cabinets, from custom designs to stock options</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinet construction may well end up being the&nbsp;single biggest expense of your entire renovation, and the results are the most obvious visual proof of your investment, so this can feel like a heavy decision. The challenge (and opportunity) is that your choices are endless, but if you focus on a few key factors, you can find the right cabinets for your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20751 mb-24 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="487" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br>
IKEA cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Matthew&#8217;s kitchen renovation</a>.</p>
<p>While it’s tempting to assume that your budget is the only consideration and while it’s true that custom cabinets can be (much, much) more expensive than stock cabinets, they don’t have to be.&nbsp;Even the cheapest kitchen is an enormous investment, so if budget isn’t necessarily the deciding factor, how should you decide and how can you keep your budget from dictating your choices? First, a few definitions.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color=""></a></p>
<h2>Should you go with custom or pre-fabricated cabinets?</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stock cabinets</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA</a>&nbsp;is widely considered the go-to for stock cabinets. Unlike almost anyone else, they mass-produce a system of set sizes, colors, finishes, and features that you pick and choose. The pieces of your order are pulled from stock supplies and shipped to your home, where you need to handle both the assembly and installation. IKEA keeps its costs low because they are sending your order to you in pieces and because the materials they use are very inexpensive.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pre-fabricated cabinets</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lowes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lowe’s</a>,&nbsp;and other big-box national retailers are distributors of independent lines of cabinets. They offer a semi-custom option: like IKEA, you pick and choose from set sizes, colors, finishes, and features (though national retailers tend to have more options overall). Unlike IKEA, your order is then manufactured and assembled for you so that your cabinets arrive ready for installation. Because you have more choice in materials and construction, the range of prices varies more here. You will probably pay more upfront for higher-quality materials, but you may spend less on labor because the cabinets are assembled before they get to you for installation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Custom cabinets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets are designed and constructed by hand based on your individual design. You define the sizes, materials, finishes, and features and your order is hand-crafted and delivered for installation.&nbsp;Because your choices for materials and construction are endless, the range of material and labor costs is very wide. The costs here are generally distributed between your choice of material and style, labor, and a more personalized design and customer service approach.</p>
<h3><strong>High-end, built-to-order cabinet systems</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A small group of cabinet companies also offer cabinetry systems that are extremely high-end (<a href="https://bulthaup.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulthaup</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.henrybuilt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henrybuilt</a>&nbsp;are examples). These companies are known for beautiful and durable cabinet construction and best-in-industry warranties, but the bare minimum for even&nbsp;a small kitchen can easily exceed <strong>$20,000</strong>, so unlike other categories of cabinet construction, this option is only available if the starting point for your budget allows you to consider it.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets might be less expensive than you think if your kitchen has limited space, lots of space, or an unusual layout.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a tight kitchen, stock and pre-fabricated cabinets in standard sizes might not be worth the initial material savings because you will need more inventive labor to fit everything in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a large kitchen, extra depth or high ceilings give you an opportunity for additional storage and functionality. Non-standard cabinet heights and depths can bring value to your renovation and re-sale value. Multiple corners, awkward niches, and unusual footprints can be&nbsp;tough to outfit. Stock and pre-fab cabinets in standard sizes may force you to spend money on filler materials, wasted space, and labor for semi-custom adjustments.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-24618 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-723x1087.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel cost" width="723" height="1087" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-723x1087.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br>

<h3>Custom cabinets might be worth extra money if you plan to stay for years, have kids or a high-traffic kitchen, or want personalized support.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Semi-custom and custom cabinets offer higher&nbsp;quality materials in sturdier thicknesses that last longer.&nbsp;Particle board and MDF, two common materials for stock cabinets, are susceptible to water and have a shorter life span than plywood and wood. 1/2” particle board will not last as long as 3/4” or 1” furniture-grade plywood cabinet bases, and solid wood doors and drawers will endure tougher handling over the years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets also typically use sturdier construction and joinery methods. Custom cabinetmakers will often use dovetail joints that interlock pieces of wood to distribute weight and stress more evenly, whereas stock nut, bolt, and nail methods isolate wear on a few points. They also offer options for tougher hardware elements like hinges and drawer sliders. In addition, custom cabinet makers generally provide a higher level of design support and customer assistance. They will do site visits, re-designs, and get a real person on the phone with you when you need it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You might be absolutely fine to handle the ordering and delivery of a stock system, but if you hit a roadblock, custom cabinet companies expect to support you and respond personally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Once you order the IKEA materials and you pay for assembly and installation, you’re not far off from a custom option that would last longer and provide more options – for a few extra thousand dollars, you may actually get a much better deal.&nbsp;Each time you take one of these steps up in material quality and thickness, you have a corresponding price and life span increase.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Alan<br>

<h3>Cost aside, pre-fabricated cabinets might work best for you if your renovation timeline is speedy or you feel overwhelmed by choice.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets have lengthier lead times. If you’re gearing up for a renovation in the next two months, you can get your hands on pre-fab cabinets in-store on a same-day basis, or delivered within two or three weeks. And, a perceived weakness of pre-fabricated cabinets is actually a real strength: for many homeowners, unlimited choice is not necessarily desirable. Many homeowners go with custom cabinets because they think they want options and then end up feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed. Pre-fabricated cabinets offer a pick-and-choose experience that requires less homework and decision fatigue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Many clients ask us what styles we offer and it can be hard to explain that it can be anything they imagine. Shops like ours provide personalized&nbsp;design as part of the overall service to build features for individual clients.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a></i></p>
<h3>Still having trouble deciding? Go for a&nbsp;hybrid!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Combining a pre-fab kitchen with custom pieces can lower your cost without compromising on quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Combining a pre-fab kitchen with custom pieces allows for lower cost and uniqueness. Companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.semihandmade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semihandmade</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://kokeena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kokeena</a>&nbsp;make door and drawer faces for stock cabinets so you’re not limited to IKEA’s palette. In addition, there are endless options for shelving, countertops, and cabinet pulls&nbsp;allowing for individuality while using inexpensive pre-fab cabinets.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Lauren and Adam</a></i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When I first moved into my apartment a year ago, I knew I wanted to renovate the kitchen.  I wouldn’t say the place is a fixer upper, but the kitchen was dated – the appliances were all too small, the backsplash was an awful, murky green tile, and the cabinets were too high and just did not provide enough efficient storage.  There was also a big hole in the wall right underneath the sink that I totally missed prior to moving in. With the costs of buying my first home, renovating wasn’t something I could take on immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This summer, however, my fiancé is moving in. So, after a year of living with a less than optimal kitchen, I did a bit of financial planning and I decided to bite the bullet and take the leap to do a renovation-on-a-budget.<span id="more-9349"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-cabinets-black-floor-before-renovation"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48016 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-Before.jpg" alt="small kitchen with white cabinets and square backsplash tiles and black floor before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-Before.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-Before-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-Before-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Planning Process </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I started planning in early April, starting with where I would purchase my kitchen (easy, Ikea), whether I would replace my appliances (initially no, but then decided it would be better from a resale perspective to have “larger” appliances), and how I would find a contractor (um, who knew?).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kitchen Cabinets</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I planned a day out to Brooklyn Ikea with my fiancé, sister, and friend, mostly for moral support, but also because who doesn’t like to spend a day hanging out in Ikea?  I had at that point pored through the catalogue and had a general idea of what I wanted, which ended up being what I chose: <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AKURUM in Lidi White</a>. While at Ikea, I learned more about the planning services they offer, and I was happy to pay $99 for someone to come over and measure my kitchen and upload the specifications into the Ikea Kitchen Planner (more on how this worked out below) before I started playing pretend architect and interior designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Appliances</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I decided to replace my 20 inch range with a 24 inch range, my small white refrigerator with a shiny new LG “skinny” fridge, keep my 17 inch wide dishwasher because I had never actually used it, and install a range hood (even though it wouldn’t vent outside, I thought it must help somewhat to circulate the air above the cooktop).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Contractors</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I spoke with 5 contractors, each of whom I found via a different source.  The first was through Ikea’s primary contractor, which was the company that came to measure my kitchen.  The second, I found while trolling through ikeafans.com.  The third was an independent contractor, introduced to me through a friend.  The fourth was a contact of my mother’s.  The last was through a submission to Sweeten, which I had read about in a blog post on Apartment Therapy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, I made the decision to go with #5, Peter Ramirez of NYC Pros, who I was matched to by theSweeten.  Peter was professional, thorough, and committed to staying within our agreed upon budget.  He even sat down with me prior to my big purchase at Ikea just to make sure I didn’t miss minor things like toe kicks and hinges and the like.  As we all know, going to Ikea for small items is a big pain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Countertops, Flooring and Backsplash</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I also ended up going through Peter’s contact for my countertops. It was something I had not originally planned for, but I am glad I decided to go with quartz as opposed to the laminate that Ikea sells. It took me two trips to Williamsburg and a comparison trip to Home Depot, but I now have amazing gray stone countertops that really lift the whole look and feel of the kitchen, I love it. My backsplash and floor tiles were a simple purchase made on homedepot.com, since I already had an idea of what I wanted – gray stone-like laminate tiles and a clear glass backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="demolished-kitchen-during-renovation"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48014 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-1.jpg" alt="demolished kitchen with only sink remaining during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Renovation Process</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All I have to say is that your choice in contractor drives your overall experience, because you must trust that things will get done according to your expectations from a quality and time-frame perspective. We started the renovation on May 7<sup>th</sup>, a day after I had originally planned, because yours truly took longer to get all the paperwork submitted to the coop board than expected.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Day 1 was demolition and putting in the new floors.</li>
<li>Day 2 was repairing the (gross) walls post demolition.</li>
<li>Days 3 and 4 were installing the base cabinets, which required cutting into wall.  Regardless of the exact measurements and careful layout on the Ikea Kitchen Planner, one lesson learned is that in reality, not everything will fit perfectly.  End of the weekend brought the countertop templating as well.</li>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Day 5 was wall cabinet installation.</li>
<li>Day 6 was installing appliances.</li>
<li>Day 7 was plaster and painting.  Day 7 was also supposed to be countertop installation day but our guy ended up with a burst eye artery!  So off to the hospital and for some much needed rest he went.</li>
<li>Day 8 became new countertop day, with some backsplash installation.</li>
<li>Day 9 wrapped up the backsplash and cleanup. Yes, the total renovation was only 9 days! I suppose when you have a small kitchen, it is totally doable.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, my fiancé and I were in and out of the apartment about once every other day, just to check out the progress and to make some executive decisions, like how high the backsplash was going to extend.  I feel like I got really lucky with the entire renovation. Not only was everything done on time, which I have heard almost never happens, but it was really pretty painless. In fact, by the time Peter and his team left, it was somewhat bittersweet, I was all done!</p>

<p>This week we stopped in to see a finished project that was awarded to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>. The homeowners converted their under-stair closet space into a personal wine bar in an apartment on the Upper West Side. The new bar-topped niche is the perfect place to store and display the couples&#8217; wine collection, and it also doubles as a breakfast bar, making it an expansion of their small galley kitchen. Happy with their new space, the homeowners told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our contractor was very professional, contactable (important!), and has great suggestions. [We] would definitely recommend his team.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the project from start to finish.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19539" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-01.png" alt="sweeten_winebar-before-01" width="600" height="804" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-01.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-01-224x300.png 224w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Here is the photo the homeowners included when <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project to Sweeten</a> showing their double-door, under-stair closet space. The closet would be just the right fit for a wine cooler, cabinet, and wall-mounted shelving.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19540" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-02.png" alt="sweeten_winebar-before-02" width="600" height="274" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-02.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-02-300x137.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The couple already had some ideas in mind for wood shelving. Here are some of their inspiration images which they also posted to their project on Sweeten.</p>
<p><span id="more-5187"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19544" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-04.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-during-04" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-04-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The work began last month when their contractor cleared out the space, giving it smooth walls, fresh paint, and wired new lighting for the bar.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19542" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-during-02" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-02-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The next step was to assemble and install the small cabinet and wine-cooler. The homeowners chose this cabinet from the <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martha Stewart</a> collection available at Home Depot the style is Weston in Persian Grey.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19546 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-02" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-02-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19553 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-01-1.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-01" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-01-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Here is the finished view &#8211;we love the clever use of space! As well as the pop of color added by the red Tabouret stools, available on <a href="https://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Tabouret-24-inch-Red-Metal-Counter-Stools-Set-of-2/5095629/product.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Overstock</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19547" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-03.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-03" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-03-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The homeowners chose an elegant bartop in Carrara marble, also available through <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Kitchen-Countertops-Backsplashes-Countertop-Samples/Stonemark-Granite/N-5yc1vZc3boZb0i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>. Above, wine bottles are displayed on reclaimed wood shelving from <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West Elm</a>. The homeowners told us that they opted against custom shelving when they found these attractive shelves for such a great price. However, their contractor pointed out that the iron shelf brackets are a perfect match to the apartment&#8217;s stair railing—so, in the end, these off-the-shelf shelves actually appear customized.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19548" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-04.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-04" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-04-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>New lamps with dimmers were also added. We love the hand-blown look of the pendants, similar to this glass pendant available at <a href="https://www.potterybarn.com/products/clift-seeded-glass-pendant/?pkey=cchandeliers-pendants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pottery Barn</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19549" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-05.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-05" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-05-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Sometimes we forget how essential our storage is &#8211;they&#8217;ve got just enough cabinet space to keep the niche looking clean and stylish, with all the extras stowed away.</p>
<p><em>Many thanks to the homeowners for sharing their awesome new wine bar!</em></p>
