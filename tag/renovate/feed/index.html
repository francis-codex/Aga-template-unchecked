<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our </span><span class="s1">most up-to-date New Jersey </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and New Jersey <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nine million New Jerseyans live in the Garden State. And why not? There’s the option to live close to beaches, own a farm, or live the quintessential American suburban life. There’s also a convenient commute to New York City and Pennsylvania. </span><span class="s1">According to the US Census, 64 percent of the houses are owned by the inhabitants, which means there are a lot of homes available for renovation. </span></p>
<h3>Set a budget for New Jersey home renovation costs</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re embarking on a home renovation, your first stop will be creating a realistic budget so you can compare what you have to spend and what you might need to spend to get what you want. Each project will have a unique process and outcome with many variables that will increase or decrease costs. From your tastes in material and workmanship to changes in layout, many elements will impact your budget. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luckily, </span><span class="s1">Sweeten has done some of the homework for you when it comes to home renovation costs for New Jersey. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/new-jersey-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—at no cost to the homeowner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a breakdown of typical starting home renovation costs in New Jersey, compiled from Sweeten renovations and <i>Remodeling</i>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/trenton-nj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value report</span></a>. Renovators in denser areas closer to New York City will likely see slightly higher budgets. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Full home renovation: <b>$100 per square foot (psf) and up</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end kitchen remodel: <b>$20,000 </b>to<b> $25,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range kitchen remodel: <b>starting at $30,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end kitchen remodel: starting at <b>$60,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end bathroom remodel: <b>$15,000 </b>to<b> $20,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range bathroom remodel: <b>$685 psf</b> or <b>$24,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end bathroom remodel and expansion: starting at <strong>$40,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Basement remodel: starting at <b>$20,000</b><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But remember this: While it is great to have an idea of your end cost, a contractor will want a detailed conversation and inspection of your home before delivering a more specific estimate.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey home remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey is a big state. In the northeastern part of the state, real estate prices are slightly lower than neighboring New York City. Western NJ has more affordable rural properties that give New Jersey the nickname “Garden State” for its extensive agricultural industry. The same cost variations can occur when it comes to renovating your New Jersey home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most Sweeten projects generally start at<b> $100 per square foot</b> <b>(psf)</b> in New Jersey. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3903#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Norm</a>, who is based in Northern New Jersey, has seen gut renovations start at <b>$200 psf</b> and go up from there. This cost range also includes everything from architectural design and drawings to fixtures, demolition, expediting, construction—the whole project.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46406 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png" alt="Find New Jersey Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h4>Easier logistics in New Jersey</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are fewer obstacles to a New Jersey renovation than, say, a place like New York City, according to Norm. For example, New Jersey renovations don&#8217;t normally have parking and access issues or limited hours a co-op will allow for daily construction. This can mean more efficient use of time, less hassle, and a smaller budget for clients in New Jersey.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">House renovations can be lighter on the wallet, too. Houses typically have the upside of direct access, while apartments do not. In apartments, contractors must take extra care (and time) to keep communal hallways and lobbies clean and clear. “All those things make a home renovation much less labor-intensive than an apartment,” said Norm.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a New Jersey kitchen remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<h5>Lower-end budgets</h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at <b>$20,000 </b>to<b> $25,000</b> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">One New Jersey-based Sweeten contractor</span><span class="s1"> had completed a kitchen in Monmouth County’s Fair Haven for under <b>$25,000</b> at <b>$100 </b>psf. For flooring, he used a prefinished engineered floor lumber core with a real wood veneer on the top layer. This cost <b>$2,500</b>. The cabinets were purchased ready to install and a stone counter was paired with a stainless steel undermount sink, which was quite cost-effective. A good budget number per square foot of floor space would be <b>$100</b> to <b>$150 psf</b> for economical kitchens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua, a Sweeten contractor</a></span><span class="s1"> who does a lot of renovations in Monmouth and Ocean counties, recently redid a 160-square-foot kitchen for under <b>$20,000</b>. To stick within this economical budget, he used vinyl plank flooring, a basic subway tile backsplash, and premade cabinets that come in standard measurement options like 12, 15, and 21 inches. “You can make it pretty close with those measurements, but with custom, you can make it fit exactly to what the space is,” Joshua said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another New Jersey-based Sweeten contractor agreed that a kitchen renovation can start at under <b>$20,000</b> for something basic (premade stock cabinets, basic appliances, etc.) and small (10’ x 10’ square feet).</span></p>
<h5>Mid to high-end budgets</h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range kitchen: Sweeten has seen mid-range kitchens start at <strong>$30,000</strong>. Joshua puts a mid-range kitchen in a range up to<b> $40,000</b>. Instead of hitting up big-box stores like Home Depot, as you would for a lower-end kitchen, this price bracket allows you to shop in specialty stores for items like tiles or cabinets, Joshua said. <i>Remodeling</i>’s Cost vs. Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/trenton-nj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">report</span></a> puts a typical mid-range kitchen renovation at <b>$375 psf</b> or <b>$75,000</b> total as an average for Trenton, New Jersey’s capital.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end kitchen: Sweeten’s typical remodel starts at <strong>$60,000</strong>. The average cost for this level in Trenton, New Jersey, is <b>$145,000</b> or <b>$725 psf</b>, according to <i>Remodeling</i>’s Cost vs. Value <span class="s2">report</span>. </span>The largest kitchen project Norm completed in New Jersey was more than <b>$150,000</b>. Pumping up the price were items such as a kitchen island with double-thick quartz and a waterfall edge, a Wolf range, reclaimed wood beams added to the ceiling, a wine fridge, and a very large square footage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a New Jersey bathroom remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end bathroom: Sweeten bathrooms can start at <b>$15,000 </b>to<b> $20,000</b> for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bathroom renovations can cost less if the majority of materials come from big-box stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot for porcelain tiles, a molded sink, and a fiberglass shower. “The crux of the job is always similar in terms of what you have—a toilet, a shower, tiles, vanities—then you expand your budget with what finishes you use,” Joshua said.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range bathroom: A mid-range bathroom that covers about 35 square feet in New Jersey will cost on average <b>$24,000</b>, according to the Cost vs. Value report. This comes out at <b>$685 psf</b> and can include a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain tub. Typically, the smaller the space, the higher the square foot cost.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end bathroom: Sweeten has seen high-end bathrooms start at <strong>$40,000</strong>. That same Cost Vs. Value report puts a high-end bathroom renovation at <b>$75,000</b>, based on a bathroom expanded from 35 square feet to 100 square feet (or <b>$750 psf</b>).<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The budget of a recent bathroom that Norm worked on came to that<strong> $75,000</strong> average. “It had it all—an oversized, walk-in steam shower with body sprays and frameless glass,” he said. Additionally, it had custom carpentry and a freestanding tub, “which are very expensive,” Norm added. Then, there is the less exciting but very important work of replacing the plumbing lines. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46406 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png" alt="Find New Jersey Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for a basement renovation in New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a basement remodel in the New Jersey area, expect the starting cost to begin at <strong>$20,000</strong>. The Cost vs. Value report puts an average basement conversion in New Jersey at <b>$117 psf</b>. The example project cost <b>$75,000</b> and was 20’ x 30’ with a 5’ x 8’ bathroom, shower, a bar area, insulation, and laminate flooring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there’s a lot to take into account that will impact the budget. Sometimes the floor needs to be dug deeper to raise the ceiling height. The walls could require underpinning. Electricity and plumbing might need to be installed if there is no existing bathroom. Installation and waterproofing can be significantly costly if it is needed, as well as pumps to drain out water. Some clients just want new drywall, new doors, a new closet, and fresh paint, which could put a project near <b>$20,000.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A premium basement could cost between <b>$100,000</b> and <b>$150,000</b>, according to Sweeten contractor Norm. Clients tend to get creative with basements, from custom bar areas to cinema-style entertainment rooms. “I’ve done a lot that are geared towards homeschooling with learning nooks built underneath stairs,” he said. “Or there’s been funky, retro-style laundries with dropdown racks that fall out of the walls.” </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for permits in New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, there’s a lot of good news for New Jersey renovators when it comes to permits! A few years ago, the state eliminated the need for projects to get a permit for minor work. For example, a bathroom renovation in which fixtures are being directly replaced (often referred to as “rip-and-replace”). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Doing direct replacement — replacing the toilet or oven, old for new — will keep your costs down,” said Norm. This means plumbing and gas lines can stay as is, which can be a huge expense saver. However, for trickier renovations requiring permits, some Sweeten contractors suggest budgeting 10-15 percent of the entire project’s cost for permits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In New Jersey, permits are often handled by each town and will likely be tied to the budget you submit.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">In the township of <span class="s2">Teaneck</span> in Bergen County, the first <b>$50,000</b> in your renovation or repair budget will cost <b>$30</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for permits (so permits for that <b>$20,000</b> kitchen you’re planning will be about <b>$600</b>). The next <b>$50,000</b> in a budget will cost <b>$24</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of planned work and any amount over <b>$100,000</b> will cost <b>$22</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of planned work.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">In <a href="https://www.morristwp.com/DocumentCenter/View/4041/Construction-Code-Fees?bidId=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Morris Township</span></a>, a permit will cost <b>$33—$44</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for the first <b>$50,000</b> of the renovation budget and <b>$27—$33</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for the next <b>$50,000</b> and <b>$20—$28</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for a project over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">For <a href="https://ecode360.com/12008181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Toms River</span></a> in Ocean County, the fee will be <b>$39</b> per<b> $50,000</b> of the estimated cost of work, add <b>$25</b> for projects budgeted from <b>$50,001—$100,000</b> and add <b>$19</b> for projects costing over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>

This was the case when interior designer Maggie and former architect Ross </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renovated their home in Kips Bay, Manhattan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They weren’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exactly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the same page style-wise—he’s all about contrasts between dark and light materials, while she prefers pops of color and texture—but found a happy medium. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to make compromises, but by working together, it turned out beautifully. Many of the materials in our home reflect a blend of those distinctly different design ideologies,” Adam shared.</span></p>

So when, on a total whim, they bought an apartment there, it felt like the perfect fit. Years (and two kids) later, they realized the apartment wasn’t quite right anymore and started looking upstate for a house as a second home. After they made an offer and started negotiations, it hit them: they had to appreciate their primary home before they could take on another. They worked with a Sweeten general contractor to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reimagine a home suited for their family</a>—and fell in love all over again.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New to New York City, but not to renovation, Jeremy and Chris worked with Sweeten to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transform a co-op in the Hudson Yards neighborhood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Manhattan. Along the way they learned and accepted just how different it is to renovate in this city. They also both catered to one another’s “mild obsessions” in home design. For Chris, his desire to put a banquette in “any possible corner” came to fruition in the kitchen, and Jeremy’s Anglophile preferences manifested in the cook space cabinetry and a towel rack in the bathroom. </span></p>

With their Sweeten contractor, they transformed a dark and scary kitchen into an inviting chef’s retreat. Once the renovation was complete, Tracey spread her love for cooking to her brother, and gave him a few tips in the new kitchen. “Food binds our cultures and our lives together,” she said.</p>

When they first moved into the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-one-family-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-family home in Jersey City, New Jersey,</a> they made aesthetic changes, then waited and saved money to get the real work done. Once the couple was ready to renovate, they moved into the upstairs unit and lived without a stove—and with seven pets! They divided and conquered their various projects: Carol put her attention toward the kitchen, while Jon remained focused on making sure the home felt like a one-family space.</p>

Alissa and her mom, Tatiana, teamed up to take on the renovation of Tatiana’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-family-affair-turns-up-the-style-dial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new apartment in Westchester</a> (she moved to downsize and be closer to her grandchildren). Since Alissa worked in fashion and had a good eye for style, the mother-daughter duo used her industry know-how to pick out and order all the materials themselves. Their project resulted in a classic-meets-contemporary home with pops of color—just what they had envisioned.</p>
