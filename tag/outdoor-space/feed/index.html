<h3></h3>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">A country vibe in the Westchester County suburbs</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">“This unbelievable property felt like it was in the country, rather than the suburbs,” Shana Sandberg of <a href="https://www.revelcraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revel Craft and Design</a> said. The 1953 estate, comprising of 1.3 acres in Westchester County&#8217;s Harrison, NY, had a pastoral feel. When the current owners purchased the derelict foreclosure, the house was 5,900 square feet of interior space with seven bedrooms. But the home’s interior had no large meeting space—not a great room nor a dining hall. The existing hang-out spots were a small living room, a cramped kitchen, and a basement den.</span></p>

<p><span class="s9">The house’s owners, part of a large extended family that had long enjoyed summers together, had grown out of their previous five-bedroom home. Wanting to turn this new, bigger house into their happy place, they hired the Revel team. Shana’s firm found the property and helped guide the family through its purchase. The next challenge was to create and carry out their transformational Westchester County home remodel.</span></p>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">Gathering spots for the family</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">At the top of the To-Do list was to make a place, or places, for the </span><span class="s10">family to gather.</span><span class="s9"> Shana posted the renovation on Sweeten and assisted the homeowners in hiring a contractor who would help bring her vision for the home and property to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="s9">Inside the house, Shana recalled, the existing dining room couldn’t accommodate her clients’ dining table. The kitchen was so poorly designed, it cut off the first floor’s flow. Finishes throughout the home were dated or in bad shape. The property’s outside spaces also had issues. “The outdoor space felt cut off from the land around it,” Shana said. She set out to transform this old home into the ultimate multi-generation compound. The house would have its very first whole-family gathering room along with an inviting chain of indoor and outdoor places and spaces.</span><b></b></p>

<h3><span style="color: #000000;">An addition with an outside view</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="s9">The property’s overhaul was truly a vision in motion. The new house was a dream with its seven sleeping rooms, each of which needed only light renovation, but its kitchen and bathrooms needed total redos. Creating common rooms would require additional square footage. “It was clear where a new family room would go,” Shana said, and how a 750-square-foot addition could make the house function better. She also wanted to enhance the owners’ connection with the property and natural surroundings. “It was easy to see,” Shana added, “decks and pools as the new gathering spaces.”</span><b></b></span></p>
<p><span class="s9" style="color: #000000;">The vision for all areas was to engage with the outdoors. “The addition was planned so it did not disturb a huge, gorgeous oak tree,” Shana explained; the family room extension pushes into the backyard, and windows on three sides provide 180-degree views. The plan also <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added a screened-in porch and a deck</a>.</span></p>

<h3><span class="s9">A facelift for the house’s interior</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">Inside the house, the remodel changes were just as transformational. Terracotta tile floors were replaced with smooth, warm white-oak flooring. Carrara-looking porcelain tile was chosen to bring a timeless feel to the family’s bathrooms. “For the main-floor powder bathroom,” Shana said, “we’ve had some fun with a surprise moment of a wallcovering called Sumatra.”</span><b></b></p>

<p><span class="s9">Throughout the home, Shana put an emphasis on functionality and took every opportunity to incorporate storage. “We actually made the kitchen and an adjacent bathroom smaller,” she said, revising the layouts and carving out hidden storage, including a pantry, hall closet, and much-needed laundry room cabinetry. “In the new family room, we integrated a built-in bench to hide toys and blankets.”</span></p>

<p><span class="s9">Shana had eyes on everything down to the little details, playing many roles over the course of this renovation. “We were excited to wear most of the hats in this project, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from planning to architecture, to interiors</a> and landscape,” she said. The renovation touched more than 8,000 square feet. The final square footage totaled 8,176 square feet of interior space and 3,000 exterior square feet. Working with their Sweeten contractor, Revel completed it in a year.</span></p>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">Making the most of a rocky situation</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">For the main exterior space, the goal of communing with nature was similar. “We designed cascading decks,” Shana explained, describing &#8220;hoppable&#8221; platforms that are large, inviting steps into the landscape. Minimal steel cable railings guided walkers downward.</span></p>

<p><span class="s9">The project was complicated, and the team geared up for unexpected issues. “We hit a doozy when we found that the property is mostly built on ledge or rock. The grade was too high, causing termite issues and more,” Shana said. Much of the property required regrading and excavation for the pool involved weeks of chipping. “We were prepared for it budget-wise, but it delayed us,” she said.</span></p>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">An outdoor family playground finally emerges</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">Shana extended a stone retaining wall by nearly 40 feet in making a surround for the new pool, and created a planting bed between the pool and the wall. “Now, from the decks as well as the family room, you look onto a wildflower garden that surprises with new blooms throughout spring, summer, and fall,” she explained. Instead of putting a traditional fence around the pool, the Revel team designed a bucolic log enclosure including almost transparent safety mesh. </span></p>

<h3><span class="s9">Teamwork in action</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">From beginning to end, Shana “drove the concept of creating this feeling of being out in the country</span><span class="s9">, with a palette and layout for both the interior and exteriors.” The Sweeten contractor, she said, was paramount to the project’s success. “The contractors truly felt like our partners,” she said, citing strong daily communication and accounting transparency. “They put us first.”</span></p>
<p><span class="s9">Sweeten supported the process. “They checked in during the project to make sure we were getting what we needed from our contractors, and on how the project was coming along,” Shana said.</span></p>

<p><span class="s9">The end result? An easy-access forever family home that feels far from the fray. And construction challenges that have completely faded into the woodwork thanks to good partner in her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a>. “Renovation combined with new construction is a game of planning, patience, and pivoting,” Shana says. “So much can and will go wrong. Knowing how to pivot can turn a bad circumstance into a great solution.” This family haven is living, breathing proof of it.</span></p>

<h3>Planning out the backyard space</h3>
<p>K.V. received suggestions from friends, including calls for a pool, but found herself inspired by the gardens of Mexico and Brazil. She preferred lush retreats and welcoming <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor decks</a> for relaxation and fun. Hosting friends and barbecues was top of mind.</p>

<p>Her vision for cedar fencing became the focal point of the project. The Brooklyn <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backyard renovation</a> was framed by horizontal cedar boards with areas to lounge and dine. The red perimeter incorporated natural clean lines.</p>
<p>Her <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor started by clearing the yard entirely. They pulled up everything until they reached fresh dirt, making way for a clean slate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="backyard-with-stained-cedar-fencing" class="alignnone wp-image-50617 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg" alt="Backyard with stained cedar fencing along with white chairs and lawn grass after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />After clearing and leveling the plot, he installed stained cedar fencing around the full yard. A lone mature tree in the far right corner of the yard was preserved. Her contractor discovered bluestone under the rubbish during demolition. <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No two renovations</a> are the same. As a result, he suggested upcycling them as part of a pathway leading to an elevated oasis at the back filled with gravel. Post your project on Sweeten to see what creative backyard ideas you and your contractor can <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan together</a>. Here are some <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/nyc-landscaping-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backyard renovation costs</a> to take into consideration.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50622 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated backyard with cedar walls, gravel floor and hammock area" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Discovering the green thumb</h3>
<p>Although they used fresh sod sparingly, the yard’s midsection revealed a green, lush aesthetic. K.V. admitted that having grass was a lot of work. As a consequence, however, she acquired a green thumb, a better sense of gardening, and plans for increased plantings next year. A row of mulch ran along the left side of the fencing with annuals, perennials, and blooms. It made a great foundation for her newly acquired landscaping skills.</p>

The <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/backyard-deck-goes-wall-to-wall-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elevated deck</a> included bright Acapulco chairs, a fire pit, and a hammock (which she considered tossing until she made peace with the fact that she spent most of her days relaxing here). A grill and dining area sit along the walkway.</p>
<p>With a completed backyard renovation in Brooklyn under her belt, K.V. is <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ready for outdoor living</a> in the city.</p>

Outdoor space can range from a small patio to an outdoor kitchen. Some costs to consider include flooring; bluestone is popular but slightly pricey at $8/square foot. It’s heavy as well and requires a crane. Concrete pavers cost $4-5/square feet. Both have the same labor costs. Demolition costs will be determined by the existing conditions: What is the access? Is there grass? Other costs can include fencing or lighting that may involve running buried electrical lines or removing overhead lines.</p></div>

<h3 class="p1">Overhaul an overgrown urban garden</h3>
<p class="p3">Two years ago, we bought this 2,000-square-foot townhome, located between the Crown Heights and Prospect Lefferts neighborhoods. The attached single-family house was built in 1908, and we’ve been slowly working on updating it. Last year, with the pandemic grounding us at home, we got to work renovating our backyard.</p>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backyard</a> was a blank canvas. The previous owners had laid concrete slabs on the ground in the area closest to the house, but the space was otherwise covered in grass. We allowed it to grow wild our first summer here. The brush got so high that our dog, Sasha, would walk out and disappear. <span class="s1">We wanted to turn our barren backyard into a place that we—my husband, Henry, our son, Gavin, and myself—could enjoy.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h3 class="p1">Solving the rain problem</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Henry and I knew we wanted a deck with built-in seating, and we loved the modern look of horizontal fencing. </span>We liked <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bluestone pavers</a> and wanted to incorporate it. But our first concern was to identify and solve some engineering problems. We’d had a water issue in our fence-enclosed backyard since we bought the place—flooding whenever it rained. We needed a contractor who could fix that.</p>

<h3 class="p3">Seeking the right expertise</h3>
<p class="p3">The process of finding our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor was streamlined and direct. We posted our project and soon received a bid from a small firm we thought we wanted to hire. We threw out many concerns as well as ideas when we discussed the job with the contractor, and when <span class="s2">we saw his great sketches incorporating everything</span>, we knew he was the one we were searching for.</p>

<h3 class="p3">Designing an outdoor living room</h3>
<p class="p6">Once we had what we needed, the team began the work of reengineering the drainage system on our property. This made for a lot of holes in the ground, but they knew what they were doing and they ultimately solved the water problem. To create the deck, they drilled down in a series of spots, so large deck beams could be sunk into the earth. They then created a structural platform connecting the beams, which became the deck foundation.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s3">Our Sweeten contractor and his team were wonderful from beginning to end. </span>We’d decided on the raised deck to break up the flow of the backyard. We agreed there should be a clear delineation between the ground and the spot where you &#8220;step&#8221; up onto the deck, like an outdoor living room. Whenever they had an idea, they would either lay it out or draw it for us. <span class="s3">The result was a truly collaborative design that perfectly reflected our aesthetic.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3">Customizing a Brooklyn deck renovation</h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s4">Long boards were framed horizontally to create the high vertical walls. </span>The contractor came up with the idea of spacing between the boards, and we loved it.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s4">Atop the foundation they’d made, the contractors built <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/building-your-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the large platform deck</a>. Benches and planters were built around the perimeter. </span>They customized everything. The contractor had Henry and me sit on a &#8220;mock&#8221; bench and rest our arms with drinks to determine what height to build the side tables. The bench seat slides out to reveal built-in storage for pillows and gardening tools.</p>
<p class="p7">We picked a wood stain in a color we love—it gives the wood a mixture of brightness and warmth we were looking for. A small but impactful detail was that the design team chose nails in a similar color so it blended with the wood. I didn&#8217;t even realize that nails came in different colors.<span class="s4"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">We chose square, untextured slabs of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/nyc-landscaping-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bluestone pavers</a> to surface the area between the house and the step-up onto the deck.

<h3 class="p3">Loving our Sweeten construction crew</h3>
<p class="p3">The project manager and crew were great. We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a Sweeten contractor </a>who stayed in constant contact, giving us progress updates. <span class="s5">He was <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledgeable, detail-oriented</a>, and efficient, and he was also great with kids. </span>He informed us of any challenges we were running into ahead of time, so that Henry and I were mentally prepared. This helped us to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/nyc-landscaping-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make informed decisions</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Our Sweeten contractor shared everything from design and decor ideas to recipes and movie recommendations. The crew brought such great energy to our backyard that we missed them when work was complete.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Feeling beyond satisfied</h3>
<p class="p3">Now that our backyard is finished, we love everything about it. Having a private spot of green in the city feels like an absolute must. Our backyard is a sanctuary where we can relax, eat, drink, enjoy nature, <span class="s1">and </span><span class="s5">feel at ease.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><i>Thank you, Jess and Henry, for sharing your inspiring Brooklyn deck renovation with us!</i></p>

<h3>A homecoming for Americans abroad</h3>
<p class="p2">Before the word “Covid” entered our collective consciousness, Andrew and I lived as American expats in Hong Kong. As educators, we worked long and active terms, which were often fulfilling, but sometimes thankless. We cherished our long breaks.</p>
<p class="p2">In our first few years together, we traveled all over Asia and Europe. However, we knew at some point we would settle back home in California, close to family, both given and chosen.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50465 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cory-Portrait-05.jpeg" alt="Image of LA homeowners who used Sweeten" width="1536" height="1152" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cory-Portrait-05.jpeg 1536w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cory-Portrait-05-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cory-Portrait-05-600x450.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><span class="img-label"><em>(</em></span><span class="img-label"><em>Above)</em> Family portrait courtesy of Sweeten homeowners</span></span></p>
<h3>Purchasing the right-size bungalow home</h3>
<p class="p2">2018 was our year. After I returned from a visiting professor role in the South of France, Andrew and I married in the south of California. Right after we said “I do,” we started looking for a home, for living in when we visited Los Angeles, and for renting out the rest of the year. Our goal was to find a modest, move-in-ready house in a central location, with a spectacular view.</p>

<p>We soon discovered, though, that the supply in the market meeting both our needs and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our budget</a> was greatly limited. Eventually, we chose the hillside of Glassell Park. Our 650-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bathroom bungalow was still nearly double the size of our apartment in Hong Kong. It was more space than we&#8217;d had in a long time, and we knew that it would be the perfect place to welcome us back to this side of the Pacific. Best of all, our southwest-facing view meant we could watch the sun rise and set without moving from our perch.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Working from home during Covid</h3>
<p class="p1">Then Covid happened. In the summer of 2020, we left Hong Kong, our cat Velcro in tow. Moving during a pandemic was not easy, but a larger space and the LA weather made <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working from home</a> more manageable. We decided to enjoy actually living in our home before renovating. When the time was right, we started with the bathroom, and then added something special for our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor space</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">The total renovation time, from when our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor began demolition to painting, took about six weeks. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small bathroom</a> was the biggest challenge. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wanted a space</a> that was updated, but timeless. Which meant everything had to go!</p>
<h3>Inspired by a classic bright blue</h3>
<p class="p1">We’re not afraid of color but prefer to inject it as an accent. I chose black-and-white as the base with 3” x 6” white subway tile. (It reminded us of our years in New York). To add some whimsy, we decided to mix geometric shapes—herringbone in the shower and a brick layout for the rest of the bathroom. <span style="color: #333333;">The tile installer ended up laying the herringbone horizontally instead of the classic vertical configuration, but this added to the quirkiness we had envisioned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-05.jpg" alt="Yves Klein blue bathroom remodel in los angeles" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50458" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/renovators-converted-tubs-to-showers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathtub was removed and replaced</a> with a freestanding shower. Andrew is 6’3”, and was thrilled when he discovered the ceiling could be moved up by a foot, allowing the showerhead to be mounted several inches above his red curls. For the shower floor, I chose a simple porcelain penny tile, trying to match one of my favorite hues: Yves Klein blue. To tie this rich color back to the rest of the bathroom, we painted the walls with custom-matched semi-gloss paint.</p>
<h3>Making a small space feel open</h3>
<p class="p1">I sourced all of the bathroom components myself. The pre-fabricated glass shower door plays with the geometric theme using varying sizes of rectangles. Its frosted glass helps to diffuse the light while providing a modest cover. I carried this into the blocky console sink with exposed legs. Above it, the round vanity mirror with a medicine cabinet ties back to the round penny tiles. Due to the small size of the bathroom, it was important to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open it up</a> as much as possible. So we avoided closed cabinets. This also forced us to be more mindful of our clutter.</p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-03.jpg" alt="white herringbone tile with black grout in blue bathroom remodel in los angeles" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50456" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">For the most part, I was conscious of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not over-spending</a> on the decorative components. We did splurge with the pieces for the sink and shower. And with the pièce de résistance: a Japanese-style toilet and bidet with seat warmer, air dryer, and warm water setting. Andrew doubted the necessity of this but now can’t imagine life without it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;The tile installer ended up laying the herringbone horizontally instead of the classic vertical configuration, but it only added to the quirkiness we had envisioned.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The finishing touch was the porcelain basketweave floor tiles in black and white. I thought this would be a nice way to ground the complexity of the rigid and organic shapes with one last element.</p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50461 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-08.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated deck entrance from living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3 class="p1">Bringing the deck inside</h3>
<p class="p1">When we’re home, we find the most joy <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watching the sunset from our deck</a> that looks over the neighborhood. Our goal was to bring that view into the home itself, so we decided to replace the two living room windows with a set of pre-hung French doors. The best feature of the doors is that the blinds are set between two panes of glass, making it ideal for thwarting a mischievous, climbing cat. Velcro loves to play! Now all three of us can lie on our rugs and pillows on the floor, watching the sunbeams stream into our home. We even got a retractable screen door so that Velcro, too, can enjoy the fresh air from inside.</p>
<p class="p1">We’re very happy with <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the progress we’ve made</a> on the home so far. It <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feels more like ours</a> every day! That being said, we’re still not done. Next project: <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen redo</a>! As a home chef, this is my most sacred space. Stay tuned for more!</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Cory and Andrew, for sharing your hillside home with us!</em></p>

<h3>Outdoor space with potential</h3>
<p class="p1">As the initial “space” to welcome your guests, the front porch sets the first impression. Much like a foyer, it’s an extension of your interior home before entering the main living area. Turning a porch into a place to relax and socialize would expand the living square footage. As a result, upgrading a front porch will add to your home’s value as well as its curb appeal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Read on for Sweeten’s pros and cons on porch types, what goes into a porch remodel, and the starting costs.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5">Remodeling a front porch: 6 types to choose from</h3>
<p class="p2">Any front porch must address your needs. In addition, the front porch should be a seamless addition to the house. Keep your front porch stylistically in line with the rest of the home. This assists with permit applications. Also, it helps the front porch blend in better with the home.</p>
<h4>Covered open front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">A covered open front porch is the most popular, classic type of porch. Many homeowners first think about open porches when they imagine a porch design. This porch has a roof or overhang that is attached to the house. Though this porch has no walls, it often has a railing that helps to define the space and to keep users safe.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Traditional</li>
<li class="li2">Unobtrusive</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Does not protect you from insects</li>
<li class="li2">Partially open to the elements</li>
</ul>
<h4>Screened front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">A screened front porch is a covered front porch that has a metal or fiberglass insect screen in its open areas. A screen door fills in the open door area. Screened front porches are highly desired in areas that have mosquitoes and other insects. Building a screened front porch is essential to enjoying your porch from spring to fall.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Protection against insects</li>
<li class="li2">Inexpensive</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Screen may tear</li>
<li class="li2">Some rain may still enter the porch</li>
</ul>
<h4>Enclosed front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">With an enclosed front porch, the walls are semi-solid, much like a sunroom. Often, the lower part of the sunroom walls is solid. The porch’s upper section is devoted to window glass or to insect screens.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Extends usage through the seasons</li>
<li class="li2">Electrical wiring is possible for outlets</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Less of an open, airy feeling</li>
<li class="li2">Can be difficult to keep cool</li>
</ul>
<h4>Full wrap-around front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">A full wrap-around front porch is any porch that partially wraps across the side of the house. This porch may wrap around two sides (front and side of the house) to form an L-shape. Or the porch may wrap across three sides to form a U-shape.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Integrates well with the overall house design</li>
<li class="li2">More floor space</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">More expensive</li>
<li class="li2">Blocks some house windows’ access to direct light</li>
</ul>
<h4>Entertainment front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">An entertainment front porch is a variation of any porch. This variation includes accessories such as an outdoor kitchen, bar, hot tub, gas fireplace, or TV. Some of the entertainment features can be placed on open-air additions to the porch.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">More space for socializing</li>
<li class="li2">More activities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">May be difficult to recoup investment upon sale</li>
<li class="li2">Accessories require greater maintenance</li>
</ul>
<h4>Open-air front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">An open-air front porch is an uncovered off-shoot to any type of covered porch. This adjacent, connected porch allows for other activities. These might be activities that work better in the open air than in enclosed spaces. These activities might include an open-pit fireplace, recreational space for exercising, or a larger hot tub.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Adds flexibility to the porch</li>
<li class="li2">Creates <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the feeling of a deck</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Increases porch’s cost</li>
<li class="li2">Greater weathering due to lack of cover</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p5">Basic timeline</h3>
<h4>Set your budget, scope, and renovation team</h4>
<ul>
<li>Choose the type of front porch remodel you&#8217;ll do by asking yourself a few questions. Firstly, what activity do you imagine yourself doing on your front porch? Do you think you will be on the porch mostly in the spring, and only infrequently? Then, you may want a covered open front porch. Can you imagine yourself on the front porch all through the summer? In that case, choose a screened or enclosed front porch.</li>
<li>Begin looking for a contractor&#8217;s portfolio of work. Read client testimonials and online reviews. Sweeten can help <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">match you with the right general contractor</a> in scope, location, and budget.</li>
<li>Know your budget. How much do you want to spend? As expected, homeowners like to control the cost of the porch remodel. One way to do this is to only spend available funds. But if you expect that the porch will increase curb appeal enough to boost resale value, then costs will be on the higher end.</li>
<li>Begin <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/prep-bid-remodel-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meeting with contractors</a>. Ask about contractors’ schedules and about expected start times. Most importantly, make sure that the contractor is one who shares your vision and is one you can work with.</li>
<li>Sign a contract with a contractor.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The renovation process</h4>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the contractor’s schedule, work may begin immediately. A company will deliver a roll-off dumpster to your property. Workers will begin demolishing some or all of your porch. For small amounts of debris, a hauling company may come instead.</li>
<li>The crew first dig the holes. Then, concrete is poured for the footers. Posts are attached to the concrete footers. These posts, plus a ledger board on the house, support the porch.</li>
<li>After the concrete has cured, workers install beams and posts.</li>
<li>Flooring is installed. Your front porch flooring might be an exotic wood or a composite wood. Unless this is a fully enclosed front porch, it is usually best to install durable, weather-resistant flooring.</li>
<li>The railing and screen are installed if it is a screened front porch. If it is an open porch, usually only a railing is installed. For more elaborate front porches, semi-solid walls may be added.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p5">Permits and restrictions</h3>
<p class="p2">Most communities require you to obtain a building permit for any substantial modification to your porch. Your contractor can give you advice on whether your front porch remodeling idea will require a permit.</p>
<p class="p2">In cities that have historic preservation and historic landmark overlays, you may need to apply for an additional preservation permit. These permit applications usually require a full set of plans, elevations, and photos.</p>
<p class="p2">If your house is in a housing association neighborhood, the HOA board must approve your project. HOAs tend to carefully look at how the proposed front porch remodel fits in with other houses’ front porches. Also, rules regarding home alterations should be specified in your HOA documentation. You should have received these documents when you bought the house.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Cost to remodel a front porch</h3>
<p class="p2">Any front porch remodeling idea that remains basic and uses few materials can start at $10,000—$15,000. This type of front porch is usually not enclosed. For remodels of this type, the railing might be replaced and the porch is painted. Depending on the size of the space, new materials, and the amenities being added, costs can go as high as $50,000 and more.</p>
<p>As an extension of the interior of the house, the porch is more than a path to the front door. <span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your front porch or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether an apartment, brownstone, or standalone house, Sweeten contractors can take any space and make it uniquely your own. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/tudor-style-house-renovation-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra and Nelson</a> wanted to update their Brooklyn home to fit their new needs. Their kids were grown, so they wanted to focus on the house. They wanted a more convenient living space. With the help of their contractor, they remodeled the kitchen, dining, and living room. Plus, they turned a small office into a beautiful sunroom.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten also transforms apartments for open-concept living or more personal space with walls or partitions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/home-remodeling-tips-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitzie and Jenifer</a> (<em>below</em>). created a seamless flow from one living space to another.</span></p>

<p>Kitchens &amp; Baths</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37769" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12.jpg" alt="New Jersey, Jersey City, renovation, two family, remodel, one family, kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchens and baths are the sweet spots for our contractors. No matter the square footage, each space comes with its own unique set of requirements. Bathrooms and kitchens can be rip-and-replace projects, where the floor plan is not altered or they can be of a larger scope. These types of projects can entail reworking/upgrading electrical and plumbing like was necessary for two smaller <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baths combined as one</a> (<em>below</em>) or Carol and Jon&#8217;s<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-one-family-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweeten kitchen renovation</a> (<em>above</em>).  For these changes, an experienced contractor will call in the right pros to help.</span></p>

<p>Commonly known as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADUs</a> (accessory dwelling units), these converted spaces have become more and more popular.

<p>When you have a big project, such as updating the exterior of your home or putting on an addition, having the right renovation team is key. <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-home-addition-plan-allows-a-family-of-5-to-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alicia&#8217;s</a> Sweeten contractor added 1,000 square feet to the back of her house (<em>above</em>).

<p>Sometimes a room needs a small decorative touch such as trim and millwork. Built-ins are an investment that offers a finished look and functional storage as in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Walter&#8217;s den</a> (<em>above</em>). Trim and molding also set a polished look for every room. A &#8217;60s house receives elegant millwork in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-traditional-house-remodel-offers-a-dose-of-modern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovation below.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Renovating your front porch? Here&#8217;s what you need to know about renovating (or building!) one, including style, materials, and size</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46915 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Porch-WashingtonDC-72DPI-CROP.jpg" alt="Front porch" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Porch-WashingtonDC-72DPI-CROP.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Porch-WashingtonDC-72DPI-CROP-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Porch-WashingtonDC-72DPI-CROP-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A well-designed front porch is an important part of the home&#8217;s design. Plus, it serves a function; like a place to relax or a space for greeting visitors. Sadly, many porches don’t suit homeowners&#8217; needs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is especially true of porches on older homes that have been remodeled in the past. Previous homeowners often selected design details that clashed with the character of the house. Some removed the front porch entirely, damaging the integrity of the home&#8217;s design.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take note: Porches for historic houses need to be approved by the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) for Washington DC. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s a good idea to list what you don&#8217;t like about the current porch. From this starting point for the front porch renovation, Sweeten outlines the path to building a structure that works with your lifestyle and the house&#8217;s architectural style.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How will you use the front porch?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Porches are transition spaces between the outside world and home. At the same time, they are an extension of living space that is not quite inside or outside. Start your project by determining how you will use the porch space. Will it be a space to greet guests? Will it be a family gathering spot? Do you plan to eat on the porch?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your answers will help determine the features of the new porch. In the Washington DC area, a ceiling fan will make summer evenings more pleasant. The way the porch will be used also determines its size.  Importantly, not all porches extend across the entire front of the building. <strong>Want to estimate the space needed for renovating your front porch? </strong></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A covered entry for greeting guests or judging the weather before venturing outdoors can be about four feet deep.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Porches for relaxing and living on require more space.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Comfortable seating requires a porch that is at least five feet from the wall of the house to the railing. </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Add a dining table and you will need a wider, or deeper, porch. There should be at least 36 inches from a dining chair to an obstruction, like the house&#8217;s wall. </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">To be comfortable when using the table, plan on a 10-foot-deep porch.</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Fitting the front porch with the house</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes renovating a front porch is done to enhance curb appeal.  A well-designed porch can certainly do that, whether it is a renovation or building a whole new structure. However, it&#8217;s important that the porch complement and contribute to the design of the house. It should not look tacked on.  This is especially important where the original porch was renovated in the past or removed altogether. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Renovating or adding a porch to a period home requires a little research. You can take cues from similar houses in your neighborhood.  And there are historical references, including some online, that list period details. Local designers and contractors can also help get the details right. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Porch designs can relate to the house in a few ways, including using similar materials, roof style and architectural details. Matching roof styles, such as gable or hip roofs, will help the porch integrate with the house. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Match exterior materials</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wood frame houses usually have wood porches. Brick houses have brick or other masonry foundations. The roofing material on the porch should match the material on the house. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Architectural details</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Architectural details can be anything from moldings, decorative brackets and medallions, railings and banisters, and columns. The goal is to incorporate the house&#8217;s style characteristics into the porch design. For example, the trim style around the windows might be used for the fascia of the porch.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Using the correct style of front porch columns</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Columns not only support the roof, but they play an important role in porch design. The trick is to use columns that match the style of the house. A colonial home requires classical columns that are in proportion to the porch and house. A craftsman, or bungalow, house can have stone columns or columns that are clad with siding that matches the house. Also, columns should frame doors and windows. They should not be added where they block a window, for example. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Front porch railing design</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The right railing can make or break a porch design. Victorian homes usually have elaborate &#8220;gingerbread&#8221; type railings. Simple railings with clean lines work well with contemporary home designs.  Your own research and advice from experts can help you settle on the right railing system. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding a new front porch</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Placing a porch where one does not exist should follow the same design rules as renovating a front porch. But the process includes building everything from the foundation to the roof. You will be selecting materials for the flooring, ceiling, and railing that work with the original house. In addition, the porch space has to be in proportion to the original house. And that is important because a house and porch not in proportion will never look right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New porches planned for historic homes in Washington DC have special provisions. Basically, a new porch, as well as a renovated porch, must be historically accurate. Approval for changes come from the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) for Washington DC. It is best to check what is and is not allowed before spending too much time on the design process. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Expanding on the back porch</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Back porches are another matter. There is a 20- or 25-foot setback from the rear property line, depending on location in Washington D.Cthe city. But you cannot build out beyond 10 feet from an adjoining house.  So if your back walls lines up with your neighbor&#8217;s, you can <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build a 10-foot-deep back porch</a>. But if their wall or porch is five feet beyond your wall, you can build out 15 feet. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Building permits for porches</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DCRA is the body that issues building permits. The process from application to approval can take two to four months. DCRA circulates the permit application to a number of government agencies, including the Historic Preservation Division. Navigating the process is difficult. But an experienced designer or general contractor will handle the permit process for you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DCRA will consider property setbacks in the process. In the front, you cannot build beyond an existing structure that is closest to the street. So if houses on your block have porches, you can build out to the porch nearest the street. </span></p>
<h4>Starting a front porch renovation</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Considering your own front porch renovation? Porches provide valuable living space, plus they can <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/curb-appeal-goes-a-long-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enhance the curb appeal</a> of a house. But remember—the design, whether a renovation or new construction,  should look like an extension of the main house.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An outdoor kitchen is the ultimate al fresco space! Get ready for a ton of fun (and a good investment for your home)</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Deck-1000-res.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="outdoor-swimming-pool-brown-deck" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Deck-1000-res-723x480.jpg" class="mb-10" alt="outdoor swimming pool and brown deck area with furniture after renovation" width="723" height="480" /></a><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Outdoor kitchen renovation by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Dennis</a></span></p>
<p>If you agree that the kitchen is the heart of the home, then consider bringing that sense of entertaining and relaxation outside with an outdoor kitchen. The options for an outdoor kitchen are endless—sinks, fridges, lighting, roofing, the list goes on.</p>
<p>If this sounds appealing, then you are not alone! More than 70 percent of homeowners who have outdoor space are looking to enhance the patio with the goal of making it more relaxing, according to a recent survey from American Home Furnishing Alliance. A CNN Money survey predicted the outdoor kitchen market to be worth almost $6 billion yearly.</p>
<p>An outdoor kitchen might become the cherry on top of your home renovation plans. It isn’t the cheapest project, nor a necessity, but <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines what you need to know to help you weigh your decision. Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</p>
<h3>How to schedule your outdoor kitchen project</h3>
<p>Luckily, it&#8217;s possible to do outdoor work at nearly any time of the year. However, weather with temperatures above freezing (minus rain and snow!) is preferred. On average, the shortest timeframe to complete an outdoor kitchen without delays or unforeseen events is 2-3 weeks. The longest average timeframe for an outdoor kitchen completion is four months. Start the process at least six months before you want to have the outdoor kitchen completed which also leaves enough time to create a good kitchen plan, advises Dennis, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten general contractor</a> in Philadelphia.</p>
<h3>How much does an outdoor kitchen cost?</h3>
<p>Like all home renovation projects, it’s best to determine what you want to spend in the beginning. Your budget will be a meeting place of your financial abilities and what you need and want. Dennis has worked on outdoor kitchens in the Philadelphia area that range in price from $15,000 to more than $100,000, which is a similar price range given by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6576#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jose, a Sweeten general contractor</a> in the Miami area.</p>
<p>A lower-budget outdoor kitchen will use materials such as concrete or cement pavers for the floor, according to New York City <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Santi</a>. Pressure-treated wood for cabinetry is also another good value choice. Materials in a more expensive outdoor kitchen could be stainless steel cabinets, stone floors, and a natural stone countertop, Santi said.</p>
<p>Appliances will also take up a big chunk of the budget. Jose said you should expect to pay several thousand dollars for a grill, fridge, and other appliances that are tough enough to survive the great outdoors.</p>
<p>The national average cost of a mid-range backyard patio that includes a fire pit, small fridge, sink, gas grill, lighting, a pergola, and a 20-foot square patio on flat ground is about $56,000, according to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs Value</a> report. That renovation will add over $30,000 to your home’s value. Many outdoor kitchens will start with a patio or deck that is already there, potentially bringing down the cost, according to Dennis.</p>
<h3>Design ideas for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>The layout of your outdoor kitchen can be drawn up by a kitchen designer or in a growing number of cases, a landscaper, says Dennis. Landscapers help to blend the outdoor kitchen into the overall look of your outdoor space. And of course, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your general contractor can likely assist</a> you with the design.</p>
<p>Consider where you place the grill, sink, and fridge as they create the “work triangle” for whoever is cooking. Be sure to keep that area free of obstructions or foot traffic. The design is also an important time to look at the strength of your deck if you are not starting from scratch. Dennis advises that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">existing decks will need to be assessed</a> to determine if they can handle the added weight.</p>

<h3>Materials used in outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>With the outdoor factor, the materials used will differ greatly from your indoor kitchen. And then factor in your style preference and budget. If a bench—a single permanent structure that encompasses countertop, storage, and appliances—is part of your design, common materials are stucco, concrete, or stacked stone, says Dennis. Quartz is also a possibility, according to Jose.</p>
<p>When it comes to cabinets, don’t install too many as you’re not going to keep a lot of plates, pots, and pans in your outdoor kitchen. Whatever you do have should be able to stand up to the winter cold and that includes pipes that drain easily for winterizing.</p>
<h3>Common outdoor kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>The staple piece of your outdoor kitchen, and likely the most expensive, is the grill. If you’re planning on installing this permanently by building it into a bench, then don’t hold back on price, Dennis advised. “You want to make sure you have a quality grill—and fridge—because if they break you aren’t going to find one that is an exact fit for the permanent structure,” he said.</p>
<p>Whether your chosen grill will use a propane tank or rely on gas lines, it will have a big impact on your budget, timelines, and permits needed. Even though you&#8217;ll need to replace a tank, you won&#8217;t need gas lines from house to patio; which saves time, money, and effort.</p>
<p>Ironically, not all fridges can withstand the winter. “Some fridges cannot handle freezing weather even though that seems odd,” Dennis said. Outdoor fridges must work harder to maintain a constant temperature when the weather fluctuates. Consider high-grade stainless steel, which will reduce rust.  But don’t forget the added convenience of an outdoor fridge comes with the inconvenience of needing electricity. This will set you back a few hundred dollars, but solar energy is a possibility.</p>
<h3>Coverings for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Providing shade and shelter from the rain comes in many forms. For more extravagant outside kitchens—such as a TV for watching sports and a sound system—Dennis recommends something similar to a gazebo roof that has full coverage. There’s also lattice, which will provide some shade, but not rain cover. On the lower end of the budget scale is a retractable awning.</p>
<h3>Lighting for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Have a long think about what you will use your new outdoor space for. Will you be reading? Playing cards with friends at night? Then perhaps you need more lighting over the seating area as well as where you prepare the food.</p>
<p>Hosting dinner parties? Then consider more ambient lighting that highlights architecture. And if you’re already planning on having a fridge and the electricity it needs, the lighting might be a natural progression.</p>
<h3>Plumbing for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>Running water is important for cooking, so prepare to lay some pipes from your house to your outdoor kitchen. Depending upon the distance, it could cost between $600 to $1,500, according to Sweeten contractor Jose. Cold water is the only necessity here, but “if a client really wants hot water, we can explore a really small, tankless water heater,” he said.</p>
<p>Once you get the water out there, you then have to get rid of it. “You can’t put the waste water into the ground,” said Jose, “It needs to be connected back into the house’s sewer.” Use of a <a href="https://homesteady.com/info-12182622-can-use-dry-well-outdoor-sink.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dry well,</a> where water is filtered before going into the ground, might be possible, but this will depend on building codes.</p>
<h3>Tip: Prepare for permits</h3>
<p>The permitting process for outdoor kitchens can be surprisingly complicated. Not only will you need a building permit, but also an electrical permit for refrigeration. If you don’t want to use gas tank lighting, you’ll need mechanical or plumbing permits for water and gas. To avoid gas or electricity permits, clients can use a gas cylinder for the grill and solar energy for electricity, Sweeten contractor Santi suggested.</p>
<p>You may need approval from a zoning department. Dennis advises homeowners to check their local zoning codes as there may be limits on how much land you can cover with materials like concrete because rain cannot easily soak through it. There may also be restrictions on how close to the property line you can build. “It would be a waste of time to design something gorgeous and then submit it and not have it approved,” Dennis said.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Guest post by homeowner Michelle</em></p>
<h3>Finding the right contractors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My journey down the renovation rabbit hole began when I found myself picturing the dilapidated garage in the backyard as my dream “diva den,” as my best friend calls it. While researching different designs and models, I remembered an article on Sweeten I&#8217;d read a few years ago and had always wanted to use their services. It seemed like a no-brainer to have an intermediary help locate vetted contractors. It also solved the huge question of where to begin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since this was my first ever renovation project, I had no idea what my renovation would cost. Sweeten helped me modify my scope of work and nail down a realistic budget. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced me to a few contractors</a> who were a good match for my project. I finally felt like I had a team behind me, which is great once you start writing big checks.</p>

<h3>Planning the &#8220;she shed&#8221; garage remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I knew instantly that the first Sweeten contractor I met was the right fit for the job. Finally, I found someone as excited about my garage as I was! At that stage, I only had a basic idea of what I wanted. We took down most of the existing structure, retaining only the foundation. Since I was renovating a 12&#8242; x 19&#8242; garage, I wanted the interior to be basic and for the structure to retain the identity and functionality of a garage. That meant concrete floors, no molding, and a statement-making garage door. If you took out the rugs and furniture of the she shed, the structure could have use as a garage or workspace. I also wanted a calming space with one stipulation: no white walls.</p>
<h3>Experiencing a real-life renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with everyone on my contractor’s team was amazing. I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way. Most importantly, nobody exposed me for the complete novice that I was. Gaining an understanding of how everything worked also helped reign in some of my design ideas. To top off the contractor’s great service, he downloaded WhatsApp to stay in touch with me when I left for Cuba mid-project. I greatly appreciated his dedication to my peace of mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather was one of the biggest challenges during my project. It wasn’t an issue when my project started in August. However, when November arrived, it was either too cold, too rainy, or was supposed to rain but didn’t. Either way, there were a few bad weather days that halted work on The Shak. My contractor also had to juggle other clients. In my naiveté, I thought contractors worked on one project at a time. I came to understand that The Shak was my highest priority, but contractors work on other dream projects at the same time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25862 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-07-09.gif" alt="ladder to garage attic" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>Building a ladder to the attic</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the exterior took shape, and the interior work began, I became more involved in the project. That is also when my attention to detail heightened. For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage, we utilized the space</a>, we utilized the space above the ceiling. How to access that space became an hour-long discussion. I asked the contractor and his partner how I would get up to the storage space. &#8220;Use a ladder,&#8221; they said. &#8220;That’s what I do in my garage.&#8221; I’m no mathematician, but a nine-foot-tall ceiling plus a five-foot-tall girl does not equal easy movement of big boxes up a six-foot ladder. And where would I keep this ladder when I wasn’t using it? After a bit of selling on my part, they agreed to install an attic ladder. It was worth hashing out and in the end, my contractors loved the ladder too.</p>
<blockquote><p>I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Personalizing the &#8220;she shed&#8221; bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It may sound weird, but finding my dry-flush toilet was exciting. The she shed did not seem usable to me if you had to keep going into the house to use the bathroom. After endlessly searching for a toilet that did not need to be hooked up to sewage lines or have an odor, I came across a dry flush toilet. It is a great invention. It works like a Diaper Genie disposal system with a continuous bag that self-seals when “flushed,” then, a new portion of the bag opens for use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the bathroom is a small 3’ x 4’ space, I definitely wanted some over-the-top designs on the walls. I initially thought of using three-dimensional self-adhesive wall panels but decided against that since I wanted a mix of color and patterns. As a naturally curly-haired girl, the print I chose was a perfect fit for my preference of streamlined chaos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25844 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg" alt="garage bathroom remodel" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A tip on DIY wallpaper hanging</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, by the time I found the mural, the contractors had completed the interior space. So, my best friend and I enrolled in the university that is YouTube. After watching about twenty videos, we felt qualified to hang wallpaper, something neither of us had ever done before. I love what we accomplished, but some things take more skill and patience than she or I possess. I will never hang wallpaper again.</p>
<h3>Ultra-bold backsplash tiles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the contractor installed the sink and countertop, my <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next big project was the backsplash</a>. I wanted something different and eye-catching, something that would not bore me. I came across graffiti tiles but the designs weren&#8217;t bold enough. After feeling empowered with my new construction knowledge, I decided to decoupage my own tiles. We figured out the dimensions for the backsplash and measured out 5&#8242; x 2&#8242; worth of decoupage tiles as well as some purchased ones. It is one of my favorite things in The Shak. Now, when my friends come over, they all choose their favorite tile. I love how they invite interaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have never embarked on a project of this size. At times, it was scary. I would get a call at 8 a.m. from my contractor, asking <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which direction I wanted the French doors</a> to open or what size I wanted the windows to be, with no clue of how to respond. My advice to anyone starting a project would be to pick a contractor that listens to your ideas. It is also helpful to watch some YouTube videos, home improvement shows, or however else you like to educate yourself. The more a homeowner knows, the better he or she can direct the construction of their masterpiece. I couldn&#8217;t be happier with everything I accomplished in making The Shak a reality.</p>
<p><i>Thank you, Michelle, for sharing the story of your she shed, The Shak with us! We hope it brings joy and relaxation.</i></p>

<h3>Choosing between a house or apartment</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My husband and I used to live in Manhattan in a one-bedroom apartment. Once we decided to have children, we knew we wanted to live closer to our families. So we opted to buy a house in the Bronx and have our parents partake in child-raising. Originally we thought we would have one child, live in the area for a few years, and then move back to Manhattan once school started. </span></p>

<p><span class="s1">We were most excited about having a bathroom on the first floor and not having to go upstairs.</span></p>

<h3>Our house addition plan: Envisioning more space</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, we soon fell in love with having a house and wanted to have more kids. Our neighborhood is quite ethnically and socioeconomically diverse. It feels like a nice mix, like we’re away from the city, but not quite in the suburbs. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We wanted more living space on the first floor because it’s where we spend most of our time as a family. We also wanted our children, who are 9, 6, and 3, to have larger bedrooms and decided to add a 250-square-foot attic dormer for that purpose. The idea was for the new space to be airy and maximize the view of beautiful trees in our backyard. Our 280-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement converted</a> into a ping pong room for extra recreational space.</span></p>

<h3>Transformation outside the kitchen</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, the window that previously looked out on the old deck was converted to a passthrough window that now connects to the new sunroom. The kitchen countertop was extended about two feet to the end of the wall that divides the dining area and kitchen. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Off of the kitchen, we added a 280-square-foot sunroom that includes a bathroom, pantry room, and living area. We were most excited about having a bathroom on the first floor and not having to go upstairs. The pantry provides tons of food, toy, and sports equipment storage. The new <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor deck</a> is off of the sunroom and is 250 square feet.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our favorite part of the renovation was working with the architect and our Sweeten general contractor on the layout of the new rooms.</span> <span class="s1">However, the most anxiety-provoking situation was waiting for support beams to be delivered and installed. For two days we had no roof and obsessed about checking the weather to make sure it didn’t rain! </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor had experience with all aspects of our project. He was great at giving us ideas and then executing the plan. We also shared the same taste in simple, modern, open design. He was able to deliver exactly what we envisioned. And if you need to file for city permits, our advice is to use an architect who can do that. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was great to have Sweeten follow up every step of the way. We knew Sweeten would be there if we experienced problems with our contractor. Luckily, we didn’t need that assistance. Our contractor’s team was excellent!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our new house addition space makes us feel less crowded. Now, our children can grow and play without feeling like we’re being swallowed up by all of their toys.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-45153 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chicago-Patio-Blog.jpg" alt="outdoor patio" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chicago-Patio-Blog.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chicago-Patio-Blog-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chicago-Patio-Blog-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Homeowners have a major craving to spend time outdoors. </span><span class="s1">Without leaving home, that may mean lounging on a balcony less than 20 square feet, or up to a spacious roof deck. If you&#8217;re looking to refresh your existing outdoor space or build a new one, you&#8217;ll need to know where to start before swinging a hammer. Here, we share key tips on <span>building a roof deck and other outdoor spaces in Chicago</span> from <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">House decks and patios</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adding a deck</a> is one of the most sought-after remodels in Chicago. And it brings one of the highest ROI (return on investment)—72 percent for wood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The prevailing design thought is to create a flow from indoors to out. That means designing a space in sync with your home’s architecture and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/renovating-design-trends-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interior decorating style</a>. In most Chicago homes, the main living space often is at least four feet above grade. So an ideal location for a deck is just outside a family room. French patio doors or sliders are the perfect bridge to the outdoors. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The overall deck size depends on the footage between the back of the house and the garage. Usually, that’s minimal, considering that an average city lot is 25’ x 125’. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-build-a-chicago-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garages</a> are at least 20 feet deep. And steps leading outdoors eat up space. Or, you might opt for a smaller landing area at grade, with a courtyard terrace in between the house and garage. That affords some opportunities for green space—a small tree, perimeter planting, and/or containers. </span><span class="s1">“With a fixed amount of land,” said Chicago-based Sweeten contractor David, “you have to make the most of what you have.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Older <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2020-home-renovation-costs-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-family homes</a>, like those in the northern fringes of the city, enjoy more sizeable backyards. Some have deeper lot sizes, while others may have side lots. Victorian houses often have porches, some that even wrap around. Patios are especially desirable, as they especially suit entertaining and grilling. Some of them are quite spacious. </span></p>
<h3>Outdoor space materials</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some options for patio materials include brick pavers and stone (bluestone is especially popular). Porcelain is gaining traction because there’s a wide variety of lookalikes including slate, stone, concrete, and wood. Concrete offers different looks, too: staining or painting in colors and stamping, which can mimic flagstones. Synthetic composite polymer decking is another popular choice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For outdoor deck spaces, some designers like to continue the look of flooring inside to out. Wide plank hardwood, for example, can transition to a synthetic decking in a similar shade. Porcelain plank options resembling wood are authentic even down to the feeling of a grain. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45154 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sweeten-GC_ChicagoPatio.jpg" alt="chicago outdoor patio" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sweeten-GC_ChicagoPatio.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sweeten-GC_ChicagoPatio-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sweeten-GC_ChicagoPatio-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Chicago renovation by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6105#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Brad</a>. <em>Photo</em>: Bitter Jester Studios</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another outdoor material option is wood, like teak, the Brazilian ipe, or South American cumaru. Sweeten contractor David is a fan. Ipe is a very dense wood that will not decay, and is resistant to termites, mold, and mildew.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It’s a little more expensive,” he said, “but it doesn’t rot and has fire ratings better than steel.” For roof decks, he has installed cumaru as a 20” x 20” tile. Tiles pre-drilled to fit tile connectors allow draining and picking up sections for repairs, like leaks on the roof. “That’s the beauty of it,” he said.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Urban decks</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Roof decks are particularly tricky outdoor Chicago spaces and there are city codes that must be implemented. For one, a garage with a roof deck requires a full foundation. That expenditure is between $12,000 and $19,000 for concrete alone for a typical 22’ x 24’ foot two-car garage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“If you go within two feet of an adjacent building, the material has to have a one-hour fire rating. That’s two thicknesses of drywall before you get to the siding,&#8221; said David. &#8220;Also, a three-foot parapet wall is code. So is a membrane for the roof and a scupper, so water can drain off.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition, if you have a grill, you need a fireproof landing. Slightly pitching the roof helps drainage. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contractors often coordinate</a> with landscapers, who can create a system of planters with integrated irrigation. Most decks these days have built-in electrical outlets. They cover not only lighting but charging laptops, and phones, or even installing ceiling fans in pergola-like structures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building a deck requires a permit. But it’s easier and takes less time to get than a typical building permit. </span><span class="s3">Sweeten contractor David also has built porches on several levels at the back of homes. </span><span class="s1">“We did one that was only about 7 x 8 feet, a third-floor walkout right off of the bedroom,&#8221; David described. &#8220;It had a roof, with sides open. They’re putting in a two-person hot tub. “</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">City outdoor living</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><a href="https://www.toddmhaley.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Todd Haley</a>, principal of the design firm, tmh, in Chicago, does most of his work in city highrise condos with balconies or private terraces. He has done outdoor kitchens, with grills, under-counter refrigerators, and wine coolers, with custom teak or ipe cabinets. One favorite quartz countertop wrapped around the ends in waterfall style—“a very clean look.” It’s applied over waterproof fiberboard as a substrate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The big difference between doing something in the city versus the ‘burbs is that it’s like designing a yacht,” said Todd “Every inch matters. In the suburbs, there’s more room to play around.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Also, if you want to build a pergola, for example, you have to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/a-guide-to-an-hoa-before-you-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go through the HOA (Homeowners Association)</a>, get your plan approved per condo rules,” he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;That might be a lengthy process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Todd changes up paving materials according to the location. On balconies, he usually uses painted concrete slabs; on terraces, wood plank flooring “floating above the slab for drainage.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Fence aesthetic</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Sweeten contractor David, aesthetics are most important, and he doesn’t like additions to look tacked on. He always is sympathetic to architectural style. With fences, for example, he sees an opportunity to look at them as sculptures. “In wood-frame homes, I like (fences) to be more like a wall, to look like the house.” From that starting point, he said, you can create the hard spaces.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Connecting a home to an outdoor space</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That sometimes is challenging when homeowners want a more direct connection to a roof deck. “In one location, we’re building a bridge from the second-floor back porch directly to the garage,&#8221; said David. &#8220;That also adds a degree of security so nobody can just walk up to the deck.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The general contractor also likes to create more gracious back entries. “Typically, we build a roof—not a flat roof, but one that complements the style of the house,” he explained. It also shelters from the elements “so you can stand there and not get soaked when it’s raining.” </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Building wide stairs</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The other consideration is scale. A three-foot-wide set of stairs is hard to navigate with two bags of groceries, let alone kids. They are usually constructed five feet wide, ideally seven. It’s more welcoming, too. &#8220;On the landing, it maybe didn’t start out as a deck,&#8221; said David, &#8220;but because of the better scale, it’s more inviting. And you can put out some chairs, sit and have a drink.” Plus the shelter provides a comfortable spot without direct sunlight.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Consider the architectural style of the house when you build exterior spaces,” David said. “You can look at the space 10 to 15 years later and say, ‘Those were good choices.’ “</span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639151627832"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is the best decking material?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">The local climate will determine the best material for a deck. Pressure-treated pine hardwood, non-treated wood, composite, PVC, and vinyl are top decking material picks across all climates. Pressure-treated pine hardwood and vinyl are the cheapest options, at roughly $1.50 and $3 per square foot (psf) each. PVC and composite are more costly, at $4 and $5 psf. Non-treated wood runs from $4 psf for cedar, to $6 psf for redwood and $8 psf for ipe.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You don&#8217;t need to confine your living space to the inside of your home. Your backyard or side yard can offer a paradise of fresh air, natural light, plants, and flowers. Outdoor decks tie these two living spaces while also adding to the value of your home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Think of a deck as the perfect connection from inside to outside. An outdoor deck elevates users from the ground and provides a unique view of your property and beyond. Decks also can be a centerpiece of outdoor social life, a gathering place for barbecues, parties, or even restful solitude.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Decks are a great way to add space to your property,” said New Jersey-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5408#overview"><span class="s2">Sweeten general contractor Chris</span></a>. “By extending your outdoor living seasons, they basically make your home larger.” <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span class="s2">Sweeten</span></a>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, explains what you need to know about building or renovating an outdoor deck.</span></p>
<h3>Types of outdoor decks</h3>
<h4><b>Freestanding</b> outdoor decks</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Freestanding decks, also called floating or ground-level decks, hug closer to grade than attached decks. You can build these decks alongside the house or anywhere within the yard.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many municipalities don&#8217;t require building permits for outdoor deck designs less than a certain height above grade (often 30 inches) and not built over a basement or lower story. The deck area may not be part of an accessible route to either of these lower areas. The deck should still follow all applicable building codes.</span></p>
<h4><b>Attached or fixed</b> decks</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Attached, or fixed, decks are more elaborate structures than freestanding decks. They may be taller, require special footings, use guards and handrails, and attach to the home with a ledger board. Because this deck design is complex, most homeowners will hire a contractor or other professional to build an attached deck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Attached decks better integrate with the home, compared to freestanding decks. Maxx, a designer for <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6267#overview"><span class="s2">this Sweeten general contractor in Chicago</span></a>, said that his company aims to blur the line between inside and outside. “We allow the exterior to be an extension of the indoors,” he said, “and we like to have the indoor flow to the outside so that it doesn’t feel like an appendage. We like to take the whole-house approach.”</span></p>

<h3>How do you build an outdoor deck?</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building a new outdoor deck will require all of the following steps, while renovating a deck may involve only a subset. Building a new deck usually takes between 1 and 3 weeks.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The homeowner meets with the deck builder to discuss their vision for the deck. The builder may advise the homeowner on appropriate styles and designs.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Next, the team draws up detailed blueprints and prices out materials to create a solid cost estimate for the homeowner.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The builder submits deck plans to the building department. City technicians visit to mark the site so digging doesn&#8217;t damage underground services.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">They prepare the site by staking out string around the outline of the deck, and removing any necessary sod.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">After establishing the position of the piers and footers, the builders create the the deck: dig the holes; set the piers and footers; install the ledger board on the house; install the posts, followed by beams and joists.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">After they establish the general structure, they attach and trim the decking boards.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">They add additional features, such as stairs and railings.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">If needed, they stain the deck, and seal it for weather resistance.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>What materials are used in outdoor decking?</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pressure-treated lumber is the most common material for the lower structural part of the deck. Although code requirements may determine lower decking materials, there are several options available for the top deck. One way to renovate a deck is to remove old deck materials from an existing deck and replace them. This method reduces costs since the entire outdoor decking structure does not need to be rebuilt.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Composites: </b>Most composite material is made of recycled plastics and wood fibers. Wood composite is a popular material due to its softness underfoot and durability. Wood composite decks don&#8217;t ever need staining or sealing. However, colors can fade over time, especially in sunnier areas. While composites are low-maintenance, they are not maintenance-free. Like other outdoor decking materials, you must periodically clean composite wood of moss, mold, and mildew, especially if the deck is in shade.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Fiberglass:&nbsp;</b>“Fiberglass deck material is very popular now,” said Chris. “It can be painted or stained and it lasts forever.” Slip-resistant fiberglass panels overlap to form a continuous solid surface, which is beneficial when decking over a lower area needs to stay dry. Fiberglass deck panels do not rot, rust, or harbor mildew; which makes this material ideal for high-moisture conditions.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Tropical hardwoods:&nbsp;</b>Ipe and tigerwood are two common species of tropical hardwoods used for decking materials. These dense woods are difficult to cut and drill, but their density means that the deck’s longevity will beat that of pressure-treated wood, redwood, and cedar. Because of their natural fire resistance, building codes may allow some tropical hardwoods in situations where other woods aren&#8217;t an option. Tropical hardwoods are expensive—but they may help both the deck and the home maintain value over the years, even into resale.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Redwood and cedar:&nbsp;</b>Redwood and cedar are softwoods mainly sourced from western states. These materials are a good compromise between expensive tropical hardwoods and pressure-treated wood. These kinds of wood are imbued with natural tannins and oils, and do not require chemical preservatives.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Pressure-treated wood:&nbsp;</b>The most economical choice is pressure-treated wood. Southern yellow pine, which is pressure-injected with chemicals that help the wood resist rot and wood-boring insects, is popular. One disadvantage to pressure-treated wood decking is that the wood splinters easily and isn&#8217;t safe for walking on with bare feet. Be sure to always coat pressure-treated deck materials on top to extend their durability. Because of these issues, Sweeten contractor Chris says that pressure-treated wood has become less popular for upper deck materials, though it is always used for the lower structure.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">What is the best time to build an outdoor deck?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inclement weather will complicate any building project. Tarping the deck during rain or snow may improve conditions during construction, but it&#8217;s usually easier for crews to work without a cover. Frozen ground can slow digging. Late spring to mid-fall is the most comfortable and efficient time to build or renovate. Nevertheless, most deck builders work year-round. The trick to working through all seasons, said Chris, is to dig the holes for the footers in advance—before the ground freezes.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44502 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Outdoor-deck_bridgehampton.jpg" alt="outdoor deck hamptons" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Outdoor-deck_bridgehampton.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Outdoor-deck_bridgehampton-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Outdoor-deck_bridgehampton-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Renovation in Bridgehampton, NY by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4287#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #76808f;">Sweeten general contractor John</a></span></p>
<h3><strong>How much does it cost to build an outdoor deck?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The average national cost for a deck addition is $14,360, according to <i>Remodeling</i>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/"><span class="s2">Cost vs Value</span></a> report. A composite deck returns 66.8% of its cost in added home value, while a wood deck returns 72.1%. Premium decks with full-service features, similar to all-purpose outdoor entertainment areas, can range up to 2,000 square feet in suburban areas. Deck sizes in downtown areas tend to be smaller (between 70 to 120 square feet), but the decks are often higher and with multiple levels. Costs can range from $40,000 to $60,000, increasing with extra features. For example, when a deck extends and includes larger amenities, like a swimming pool, costs can exceed $100,000.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Facini,&nbsp; deck-building costs are highly variable. They depend on factors like decking materials, condition of the site, grade, number of decks and their height, plus special items like glass railings. Generally, you can expect decking material to cost around $20 to $30 per square foot for composites or tropical hardwoods like teak. Overall, total costs generally range from $25,000 to $30,000.</span></p>

			<h3>An overview of how to start planning for your outdoor remodel</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50622" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg" alt="Outdoor remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Sprucing up the out-of-doors</h3>
<p class="p1">Whether your outdoor space is seasonal or livable all year-round, having an exterior spot to relax is an upgrade in lifestyle and property value. You may be wondering how to make the most out of a rooftop deck or an urban backyard. Preparing for an outdoor remodel has many moving parts—some projects more complex than others. We break down how to begin planning and share a timeline so your green space can be ready by summertime.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>Decide on your outdoor space plan</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Santi, the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a> who transformed <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-expert-santiago/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K.V.’s backyard</a>, shared the following advice with us: “Just like any other project around the house, I recommend taking some time to decide what your goal is” for your outdoor space. Will you be using the space primarily for dining, grilling, gardening, or play? Decide what you want to prioritize: functionality or ornamentation. If there are kids involved, that will be a determining factor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Turning her attention to her brownstone’s backyard, K.V. knew she wanted to use the space to host friends and barbecues. She took inspiration from gardens in Mexico and Brazil, leaning toward a more tropical atmosphere. A tall cedar fence to provide privacy was a must-have.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Michelle and Nate remodeled <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their rooftop deck</a> to double as a &#8220;bonus room&#8221; for hanging out. It was outfitted with comfortable seating and plants to make it feel cozy. However, the rooftop felt open and exposed, so a visual barrier of plantings was placed along the perimeter. The couple also brought in a fire pit for chilly, late-summer nights.</p>
<h3>Be flexible with material choices</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">K.V. had her heart set on bluestone to create a walkway to the elevated patio in her backyard. “She had a budget she didn’t want to go over,&#8221; Santi said. &#8220;She asked us to price out bluestone, but it was a little too high, so we looked for other materials.&#8221; He added, “Homeowners should always price projects with different materials [because] changing the materials doesn’t mean changing the final goal or look of the design.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a surprise twist, they discovered bluestone buried under the dirt in the yard during demolition. K.V.&#8217;s backyard remodel paved the ground with gravel, pavers, and bluestone. While a budget might limit some choices, your contractor may be able to suggest alternative materials that fit the budget and achieve the look you want.</p>
<h3>Choosing plants for color, texture, and to enhance privacy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We asked Justin, a horticulturist at <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costa Farms</a>, to fill us in on how to choose the right plants. “The first and most important thing is to get a realistic sense of your area’s growing conditions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Consider the sun, moisture, and exposure to wind, and then pick plants that like or at least tolerate what your space has to offer.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those sunny spots, Justin recommends heat-loving tropical plants, such as hibiscus, mandevilla, and allamanda. In shady areas, birds of paradise and majesty palm are perfect for adding drama. Croton and colorful aglaonema provide a pop of color. If you choose plants that won’t survive the winter, keep them in a pot so you can bring them indoors when temperatures drop.</p>
<p>Nate and Michelle turned to landscaping to soften their space. Their landscape designer proposed lavender and feather reed grass to frame the seating area and a Japanese Maple tree. Justin also suggests other tall plants, like arborvitae, columnar juniper, and yew for privacy.</p>
<p>In K.V.’s yard, Santi filled in the spotty grass with fresh sod to transform the lawn into a thick green carpet. He also added a row of mulch along one wall for a small but manageable garden. Potted plants fill out the patio and walkway, providing color and texture.</p>

<h3>Choose low-maintenance plants and automated irrigation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors, New Yorkers prefer outdoor spaces that are low maintenance. A landscape plan with a three-season oasis, automated irrigation in the morning, flowering shrubs during the day, and accent lights illuminating trees and fences at night would be ideal. If you find yourself unlucky in plant-love, Justin has some advice: “Coleus is a fun choice that thrives in sun or shade and has delightful, dramatically colored foliage you can enjoy from spring to frost.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Similarly, consider sweet potato vine: It spills down over the side of a planter, creating an elegant look. It also grows as a groundcover or can be trained to grow up a trellis or other structure,&#8221; Justin said. &#8220;Torenia, also called wishbone flower, is another option you can grow in sun or shade.” And if watering is your biggest concern, he advises planting mandevilla, lantana, angelonia, purslane, and evolvulus.</p>
<p class="p1">For the renovation, your landscape design should be set before demolition begins, said NYC-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5301#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Shenna</a>. “The design will determine where plumbing and electrical lines are run, as well as the rough-in for the sprinkler system,” she said. “These are laid down right after demolition.” However, there&#8217;s time with final landscaping choices. They get planted around the last month or so of the project.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>Plan your outdoor remodel in the off-season</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are looking to remodel a green space, start planning and working in the off-season. For those not ready to plant or are just building up towards a green thumb, use the warm seasons to find inspiration, and plan during winter.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a typical timeline to guide you. Pro tip: Start the process early. Use the summer months prior to gather inspiration. In the fall, begin mapping out the design, landscaping, and materials with an architect/designer/contractor. “Planning, designing, and finalizing the fine details of the project can take months,” said Shenna. This gives the contractor enough time to work with the homeowner and/or designer to get all of the pieces in place.</p>
<p class="p1">By December, permits should be submitted, your contractor hired, and materials ordered (keep delivery times in mind).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Demolition should break ground by March/April for an outdoor remodel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“The best time to physically start working on an outdoor space is in the spring.” said Shenna. “The weather makes it possible to get everything prepped and ready.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02.jpg" alt="Backyard deck area with horizontal wooden fencing and barbeque grill after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50569" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h4>Managing the outdoor remodel infrastructure</h4>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6256#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor</span></a> Mike, who is based in NYC said, “The scope of the project, the square footage of the outdoor space, and material delays” will affect how much time goes into the planning phase in advance. Depending on the complexity of the project, an outdoor remodel typically takes two months to finish. However, an outdoor kitchen that requires plumbing, gas, and electrical could take longer for approvals than a deck remodel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an outdoor space, there’s a lot more to consider, like drainage. Your general contractor should have an in-depth understanding of how bulk water will be managed and how your plans will impact the neighbors. If you’re working on a roof, make sure you have access points for clearing roof drains.</p>
<h4>Organizing material delivery and approvals</h4>
<p class="p1">Your team will also have to haul all of the materials to your outdoor space. Hauling roof deck lumber, soil, sod, and plant matter up through service elevators can be costly and time-consuming. An alternative is booming materials to the roof by crane. Contractors usually have partnerships with local greenhouses and lumber yards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>They can move materials from the street to a garden more efficiently and cost-effectively than using a service elevator.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, make sure you have the necessary approvals. Most exterior improvements will require an alteration agreement and approval from the building&#8217;s architect, and many will require filing with the city. If you live in a landmarked building, special regulations will apply.</p>
<p class="p1">Start and plan early with the right professionals onboard. A well-planned deck or garden can greatly increase the value of a property. It will be time and money well-spent.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Serving as either an open gathering place or a cozy retreat, the deck has become a popular alternative to the patio and porch. Outdoor deck materials have improved in durability and beauty, with a range of types to choose from. Rather than choosing based on looks alone, it&#8217;s useful to know the pros and cons of the most common material options available.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Importance of the deck&#8217;s foundation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No matter how you design it or outfit it with planters and pergolas, at its essence the deck is a large outdoor platform. Typically, it is connected to the house, and raised from the ground anywhere from a few inches to several feet. This is in contrast to a patio, which is made of stone or concrete and set into the earth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though made from moisture-resistant or repellent material, decks should be isolated from the ground by supports set into concrete footers. Contact with soil will eventually rot any kind of wood. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Decking boards come in specially milled or manufactured sizes that are typically 2-by-4s, though widths can vary from a given manufacturer to provide you with more design options. Look for rounded edges that resist splintering.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will find many choices for joining systems. Some systems conceal screw heads, for a cleaner appearance and and to keep water from seeping into screw holes. Other systems are designed to allow expansion and contraction of the boards. “Decking boards with slotted sides can be installed using a clip system, so you do not have to surface fasten the boards,” says Doug L. Mucher, Senior Marketing Manager for <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/decking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CertainTeed</a>. “This provides a cleaner installation.”</p>

<h3>Zoning and local codes for outdoor decks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To ensure your deck is in compliance, deck supports are best installed by an experienced contractor who knows the local codes and zoning laws. Some cities or counties require approval from the planning commission and inspections during the building process. Keep in mind: these rules might limit your grand plans, or require some creative adaptations. It&#8217;s wise to consult with your contractor before proceeding with the build. “Most homeowners can handle replacing the deck surface,” says Mucher. “However, if the project requires the deck substructure to be built as well, you’ll most likely want to hire a contractor. A contractor can be required to make sure it is built to code.”</p>
<h3>How to choose outdoor deck materials</h3>
<p>Your choice of outdoor deck materials will be driven by your lifestyle, taste, and local climate. Does your area get a lot of rain and humidity? Heat and sun? Most modern deck materials can withstand any climate, but some require more upkeep than others to stay in good shape and appearance, especially in harsher climates.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Different types of outdoor deck materials</h3>
<p>Wood continues to be a popular choice. If you like classic materials, you can choose from a range of softwoods and hardwoods. You&#8217;ll get good-to-great performance, as long as you follow a regular maintenance routine. There are some synthetic alternatives, too. Consider the following:</p>
<h4>Pressure-treated pine hardwood</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: This is an inexpensive softwood that&#8217;s been impregnated with chemical preservatives, making it more resistant to insects and to splitting, swelling, and rot from humidity than other woods. It&#8217;s easy to paint. It&#8217;s also strong, and well-suited to the structural parts of the deck, even if you choose different woods for the deck surface and other visible elements. Pressure-treated pine is the thriftiest option, so it&#8217;s good for homeowners on a strict budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: It is a natural material and requires frequent maintenance to assure top performance. Pressure-treated pine is not as attractive as some other popular wood options, including cedar or redwood. As with all real wood, it can splinter. Upkeep includes deep cleaning and application of a lumber preservative annually as well as occasional sanding. The chemicals used in the pressure treatment are toxic. This isn&#8217;t typically a problem in an outdoor setting, but some homeowners prefer to keep this treated wood in places like the deck&#8217;s support structure, where they won&#8217;t have to come in direct contact with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $1.50 per square foot.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg" alt="Small backyard deck with inbuilt seating and brick wall background after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-50575 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h4>Non-treated wood</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: There’s a reason why many synthetic decking materials simulate the look of wood. There is nothing like this natural material for its warmth and expression of quality. The most popular softwood species are cedar and redwood, for their good looks and natural moisture resistance. Natural tannins and oils resist insects well, and these woods are easy to stain, paint, and seal. Some decks are built with tropical hardwoods, such as ipe, which are incredibly resilient, and in some cases are accepted by fire codes that otherwise require concrete.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: Even hardwoods are not as long-lasting as plastics. Wood can dent, split, splinter, fade, and require frequent upkeep to maintain the best appearance and life. You will need to not only wash with a wood cleaner or pressure-washer, but also seal it at least once annually. Best to sweep daily or weekly to avoid damage from gritty dirt. Darker shades will heat up in sunlight, making them unpleasant underfoot in the summer when you are likely to spend the most time there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $4 per square foot for cedar; from $6 per square foot for redwood, $8 per square foot for ipe.</p>
<h4>Composite</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: Made from wood fibers bound by a resin, synthetic decking is nearly maintenance-free. It will not warp, splinter, or rot, and it repels insects. It requires no stain or sealing and offers a wide selection of simulated wood looks and colors. It also can be molded and so lends itself to curved shapes. It requires little care except cleaning with soapy water and a soft-bristle brush.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: Surfaces in darker colors can become hot in the sun and may fade over time. It can melt if exposed to high heat, such as from a grill. Scratches can’t be buffed out, and dropped greasy foods might leave stains. It will not break down in a landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $5 per square foot.</p>
<h4>PVC</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is a thermoplastic that can be shaped and formed into a variety of products including decking. A particularly hard plastic, it won’t scratch, warp, rot, split, or stain; it’s lightweight and easy to install and requires no annual treatments other than cleaning with soap and water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: More limited palette than composite. It will not break down in a landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $4 per square foot.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Vinyl</h4>
<p>PRO: Lightweight vinyl is comprised of PVC and polyethylene. Available in faux-wood styles and textures, this material is easy to install thanks to its light weight and ease of slicing with a saw. It never needs painting, resists staining and fading, and won’t heat up, unlike natural wood and some composites. Easy to clean with soap and water.</p>
<p>CON: Over time, it may sag. It will not break down in a landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $3 per square foot.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Pergola.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30735 mb-10 size-chrono" title="outdoor deck with pergola" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Pergola-723x482.jpg" alt="deck cost" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">How to personalize your outdoor deck</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve narrowed down your choice of material, you can think about ways to customize the deck. “With all the styles and colors available, homeowners are really only limited by their imagination,” says Mucher.</p>
<h4>Outdoor deck design ideas:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mix different colors or shades of planks</li>
<li>Combine different plank widths</li>
<li>Run planks in different directions to create a pattern, like a herringbone or a fan</li>
<li>Add a contrasting border</li>
<li>Paint on a stenciled motif</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/chiminea1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30738 mb-10 size-chrono" title="outdoor deck" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/chiminea1-723x736.jpg" alt="deck cost" width="723" height="736" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><span class="img-label"> <span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Deck by CertainTeed</span></span></p>
<h4>Make the deck resemble an actual room:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create steps and two or more levels for different activities, such as relaxing, dining, taking in the view</li>
<li>Install an outdoor kitchen, chiminea (freestanding, front-loading fireplace or oven), or spa</li>
<li>Incorporate a pergola or a lanai</li>
<li>Include lighting, for use at night or to highlight an area</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, most decks, particularly those that are raised or tiered, include a railing. You can match your deck material or choose a complementary style or finish. Work with your contractor to make sure all the necessary elements are incorporated, for safety and security as well as environment and maintenance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Invest time in planning and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selecting a vetted general contractor</a> to guide you through the process. You want your deck to be dependable and a space you enjoy sharing with family and guests.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10481 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_cover-41.png" alt="greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation" width="600" height="385" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_cover-41.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_cover-41-300x193.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nate &amp; Michelle had just about finished settling into their Greenpoint condo last spring, when it came time for the new homeowners to tackle their unfinished roof deck with its killer skyline views. The couple, both creative professionals in advertising, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/807" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on Sweeten</a> to find someone who could help convert the derelict roof into an extension of their home &#8212; an outdoor room with comfortable seating and plants to soften up the space. We introduced them to a few matches, and before long, they awarded their project to Sweeten member Hutson Landscape, owned by Corey Hutson, whose expertise in landscape design &amp; construction was a perfect fit. When we stopped by to see how the project turned out, Nate, Michelle, and their bouncy labradoodle, &#8220;Kid,&#8221; were setting up to host some friends on their renovated roof.<span id="more-10460"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10465 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_before-1c.png" alt="greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation" width="600" height="389" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_before-1c.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_before-1c-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10466 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_after-1c.png" alt="greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation" width="600" height="389" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_after-1c.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_after-1c-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In just 2 months, Corey and his team were able to turn the bleak roof space into a polished outdoor room. The homeowners selected plantings based on Corey&#8217;s recommendations: lavender &amp; feather reed grass to line the perimeter, and a Japanese Maple tree to frame the skyline view. The tall feather reed grass is nice for adding a little privacy, and when the wind blows, Michelle says, &#8220;it sounds like palm trees,&#8221; which she loves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The homeowners also told us that Corey suggested bringing a water line up to their roof so that they&#8217;d have easy access for watering the plantings and keeping Kid&#8217;s bowl full &#8212; something they never would have thought of themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10467 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_before-2c.png" alt="greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation" width="600" height="388" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_before-2c.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_before-2c-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10468 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_after-2c.png" alt="greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation" width="600" height="388" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_after-2c.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_after-2c-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To furnish, Nate &amp; Michelle selected a pair of outdoor sofas and matching side tables from Room &amp; Board, and to extend their use of the space into the fall, they also purchased a fire pit that converts to a coffee table when covered (not pictured). The setup is perfect for transitioning from lounging in the sun with a book, to hosting a party; Kid is also more than content, with plenty of space to play tug-of-war (and lots of cushions to warm as well).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10469 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_after-3c.png" alt="greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation" width="600" height="390" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_after-3c.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_after-3c-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Jealousy. Envy. Disbelief.&#8221; are the reactions Michelle has gotten from her friends &#8212; maybe someone should tell them about Sweeten?! Congrats and many thanks to Nate, Michelle &amp; Kid, too!</p>
