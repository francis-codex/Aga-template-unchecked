<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47778 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Renovation-Stress-Survey-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Renovation-Stress-Survey-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Renovation-Stress-Survey-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With thousands of projects on Sweeten’s platform, we’re always looking for ways to minimize the stress of renovation—we do that by providing budget, estimate comparison and payment tools, matching homeowners with the best general contractors, following every project to completion, and sharing our homeowners’ stories. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To dig deeper into people’s biggest remodeling fears and pain points, we enlisted global market research firm Schlesinger Group to conduct our 2nd national renovation stress study. The survey of past, current, and future renovators across seven major U.S. cities gave us insight into what makes renovators’ hearts race—not in a good way—and how they approach a major project. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, seeing that 85% of homeowners consider remodeling stressful is not a shocker (though the fact that Los Angeles homeowners top the list of saying it’s “extremely stressful” was of note). Below are just some of the highlights from a hefty report that includes interesting geographical differences. We read every word to problem-solve and make the process as transparent as possible.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>1. Planning is the most stressful stage.<br />
</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yes, even more than demolition or relocation. Fifty-nine percent of those surveyed placed planning in their top three most stressful renovation steps. The good news? Our blog has plenty of <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-101/"><span class="s2">guides on pricing, timing, and other must-knows</span></a> to make renovation easier. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47779" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stats-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="400" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stats-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stats-1-300x120.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stats-1-600x240.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>2.</strong><b> Going over budget is a top concern<span>—</span></b><b>but most people don’t do that.<br />
</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not so surprising, but important nonetheless. Of those who said they went over budget, the majority actually only spent 10% more than they’d budgeted, so even though missing the money mark is a big-time fear, the amount overspent is less than you’d think. We actually advise renovators to build in a 10% cushion to the budget on all projects. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">NOTE: When you post a project on Sweeten, our platform pre-populates the various elements involved and pricing down to every last detail, from cabinet installation to floor replacement, providing a much simpler way to look at the big picture (and granular) costs. Our platform also provides a bid-leveling service to compare contractor estimates for an apples-to-apples analysis to make the smartest decision for what you’re trying to accomplish.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>3.</strong> <b>Renovation shows and videos are a major learning source.</b> </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While a renovation is really not like what you see on a 30-minute TV show, 57% of survey participants watch homes transform on TV and/or the Internet. Our advice? Get inspiration and ideas, get a sense of what a post-demolition space looks like—but don’t make assumptions about how your own project or experience will turn out based on the made-for-screen remodels. (You don’t REALLY believe you can overhaul your living space in 48 hours, right?)</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>4.</strong> <b>Men are more trusting; women need a call.</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When it comes to general contractors (GCs), men have a higher overall opinion of them (68% vs. 62%). Women place the highest importance on contractors returning calls quickly (67% to 58%) and are most often deterred by a contractor who’s difficult to get ahold of (67% to 58%). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At Sweeten, we agree that communication and chemistry are key!</span></p>
