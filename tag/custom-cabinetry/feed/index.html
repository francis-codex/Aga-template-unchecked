<p>This week we&#8217;re back in the West Village to check out a Sweeten member&#8217;s newest completed project. After almost 30 years in their 1,000 sqft flat, homeowners Ron &amp; Suzen were excited to give their space a full gut renovation which began early last summer. The home&#8217;s new 1-bed, 2-bath layout is a complete reworking of the former 2-bed, 1-bath arrangement; and a uniquely designed (<a href="/2012/10/11/site-visit-gut-modernization-of-west-village-home-first-look/#more-5425" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and precisely built</a>) open kitchen takes center stage, making it the perfect space to cook and host friends &amp; family. When we stopped by, Peter Maslow and photographer Cary Whittier (<a href="https://carywhittier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carywhittier.com/</a>) were on site as well, snapping some final shots of the completed project.</p>

<dd><span class="img-label"> Looking at the home&#8217;s new centrally located kitchen &#8216;box&#8217;: the exterior of the box is clad in solid oak paneling. Inside, the kitchen features white laquer surfaces. Peter&#8217;s team had to work extremely precisely when constructing every element of the cubic kitchen in order to guarantee perfect geometry, true to the architect&#8217;s drawings.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="img-label">Peter Maslow, owner of Maslow Interiors, was happy to see another great project finish up.

<dd><span class="img-label">We love this kitchen&#8217;s bright, modern finishes. The cabinetry was custom made, featuring white lacquer faces &amp; pre-finished maple interiors, and looks great paired with sleek white glass countertops. On the floor, Peter&#8217;s team laid 24&#8243; square <a href="https://www.stonesource.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celador tiles in &#8216;oyster&#8217;</a> from Stone Source.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="img-label"> Looking into the main living space: the dining area is large enough to set up for a big dinner party (&#8211;a certain luxury in NYC!). The living room/den in the back of the space can be closed off by a 9&#8242; pocket door in order to double as a guest bedroom. All new Marvin windows were installed throughout the home by <a href="https://www.authenticwindow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Authentic Window Design</a>.</span>

<dd><span class="img-label"> Built-in shelving and concealed-hardware cabinetry line one wall of the new den. The space has a nice relation to the open kitchen &#8211;enough distance to create privacy when needed, but otherwise still closely connected both spatially &amp; visually.</span></dd>
