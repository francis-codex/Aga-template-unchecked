<p style="text-align: justify;">When the deal fell through on a new, larger apartment, Zoe and Arvid decided to stay put in their Lincoln Square building in Manhattan and make their 700-square-foot one-bedroom work. But two years later, the cramped space won out, and they went on the hunt for a new home. Zoe, who admits to an unhealthy relationship with HGTV, dreamt of buying, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combining</a>, and renovating an adjoining apartment. They decided to send letters to their adjacent neighbors and, to their surprise, one was looking to move, so they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a contractor.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What Zoe, who works in finance, and Arvid, a 3-D designer, wanted most was extra space where they could spread out and finally be able to sit down at a proper dining table instead of crouching over the coffee table. For style, the couple would need to compromise. Zoe liked mid-century modern and rustic looks while Arvid preferred clean, modern lines with a dash of industrial.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor they chose</a> to combine their apartments set out to remove the two existing kitchens, rip out old parquet-glued-to-concrete floors, and demo some internal walls to create a third bedroom. They moved into a sublet during much of the work.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33713 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before02-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33690 size-chrono" title="brown-vinyl-floor-white-room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30.jpg" alt="brown vinyl floor in a white living room with blue wall after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-33.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33693 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-33.gif" alt="renovation, apartment combination, accent wall, hardwood floors, hidden storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few “must-haves” as the couple thought through the design. Since they’re a “<span style="color: #333333;">shoes-off household,</span>” said Zoe, they needed a storage solution near the entrance. The answer, literally, was hidden in a structural column close to where they broke through the two apartments. At first, the duo tossed around ideas about how to make the column “purposeful.” Their ideas ranged from a gas fireplace to a wine fridge. Instead, they chose &#8220;practical,&#8221; she said, and created a hidden shoe closet. “Our contractor really worked with us on hardware—concealed hinges and push-open latch—and hand-sawed the baseboard to get a wider angle for the slide-out racks,” she explained. The shoe slide-out from Elfa fit the space, and to give it a sense of design, it was painted a deep accent color for some contrast and to hide dirt on the push-open door.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When they opened the wall that would be the spot for the<span style="color: #333333;"> dining room</span>, the mood dampened for a moment when they found an unmovable gas riser. “We decided to make lemonade out of this,” said Zoe and thought about how to turn it into a design element. They settled on a “partition” type of structure that took the least amount of space while letting the light through. They found Blacktable Studio to walk them through the process. As a 3-D designer, Arvid took the lead on this fun project, creating the designs and submitting his sketches. The panels were delivered two weeks later. “Our contractor carefully installed the panel and adjusted the baseboard to make a seamless connection. This graphic panel is now a nice focal point that adds a lot of character,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-25.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33707 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-25-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, dining room, edison lighting, wood table" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They also liked the idea of having an extendable table for extra guests. “We never had a proper dining area before, so the prospect of having one definitely prompted a lot of imaginary dinner parties,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33709 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before01-723x933.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33696 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-01-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, kitchen, hardwood floors, bar seating" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33697 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, kitchen, backsplash tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33698 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-24-723x1067.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, hidden storage, accent wall" width="723" height="1067" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33706 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-22-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, backsplash tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the couple’s time was spent looking for <span style="color: #333333;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a></span> because it was the most prominent backdrop in the apartment and would set the tone for everything else. They wanted wide 7” to 8&#8243; European-style planks that were not too light or too dark. Arvid spent a lot of time finding the right hue, saturation, and wood grain. “It turned into a bit of an obsessive pursuit and we finally agreed on a natural color that&#8217;s very rustic with knots and saw marks. It&#8217;s a bit of a risk, but most people seem to love it,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-34.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33719 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-34-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, living room" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the living room, there was an AC/radiator below the window. More than 50 years of painting had “made it a big sad mess,” Zoe said. They wanted to cover it and also make it functional. Their Sweeten contractor listened to their input, and, she said, “we just designed it on the fly. One weekend Arvid used leftover black sample paint to paint over the heating elements behind the built-in.” This created more contrast against the outside white paint. Now the built-in&#8217;s horizontal slats look crisper, and you can barely see the mechanical elements behind it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other detail they focused on was smart light switches. The commonly available ones didn’t look good and the modern looking ones were way out of their budget. They took a chance on Noon Home, a start-up company selling ones around $100. “We couldn’t be happier,” she said. “The product looks modern and the app works great.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33701 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-16-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, bedroom, accent wall, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-32.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33702 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-wall-white-glass-door" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-32.gif" alt="blue wall and a white glass door and light brown floor after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To compromise their style preferences, they invented a design hybrid they called “Scandinavian mid-century” with a lot of black and white and plenty of geometric shapes. They learned the importance of taking time to plan a renovation. “Do a lot of showrooming and Pinteresting; both help you to know what you like,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33714 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before04-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33700 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, bathroom, chevron tile, glass shower door" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Once the work starts, there is little time to decide,&#8221; Zoe said. &#8220;Measure everything and live the design in your head. Know how many linear feet of closet you need and where you might store the vacuum cleaner. This is especially helpful for the kitchen design.” Zoe measured the maximum size of her pots and condiments and knew the drawer heights she needed. The only shortfall of planning too well is that you might become too attached to certain choices. She suggests being prepared for changes and understand that sometimes, you’ll have to go with the second choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33705 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-10-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, bathroom, glass shower door, chevron tile" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of some permit delays, the apartment was not ready for move-in after their sublet ended. For three weeks, they began an Airbnb-hopping adventure. “It&#8217;s a lot of stress, but we discovered different neighborhoods and lifestyles. We now know for sure commuting to New Jersey is not meant for us,” Zoe said. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living on-site</a> for the second half of the project was a big challenge and meant being around a lot of dust and living out of suitcases. Now that it’s completed, she said their new home makes them feel “happy!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A fun crop of ways to make cooking more colorful</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If patterns in the kitchen feel outdated to you, think again. We’ve got proof that they’re making a steady (and stylish!) comeback. From personality-filled wallpaper prints to classic tile patterns, Sweeten homeowners are playing with subtle—and some not-so-subtle—forms of contrast in the kitchen. Read on for five unique takes on pattern play.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21189 mb-0 size-chrono" title="wallpaper in the kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen design" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Captivated by a Hygge &amp; West design featuring orange birds on a blue background, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mollie</a> used the wallpaper to set the tone for her kitchen’s color scheme. She also chose a playful black-and-white tile to continue the thread of whimsy from the walls to the floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24620 mb-0 size-chrono" title="patterned floor tile" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen design" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/newlywed-writers-turn-dark-kitchen-bestseller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda</a> designed her kitchen from the ground up after selecting a Mediterranean-inspired tile for the floor. The rest of the design was chosen to complement the one-of-a-kind flooring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20497 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1501" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/rimas-ikea-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rima</a> originally chose white subway tile for her kitchen backsplash, but her friends talked her out of it. A mix of white and gray hex tile create a modern mosaic, providing a hint of contrast without going overboard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31090 mb-0 size-chrono" title="wallpaper in the kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="kitchen design" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After going with blue-gray cabinets in the kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-lightens-up-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ainsley</a> extended the color scheme into the dining room with an abstract blue and white wallpaper that pairs well with the warmth of the wood furniture and flooring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21360 mb-0 size-chrono" title="patterned floor tile" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="kitchen design" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to preserve the classic design of her prewar kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emily</a> chose a simple black and white color scheme. For the floor, Spanish tile injects some old-world charm and ties the look together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-28923 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />While gray cabinets and gold hardware set a sophisticated tone in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/holly-kitchen-bath-renovation-greenwich-village/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holly and Christian’s kitchen</a>, a chevron marble backsplash keeps the space feeling fresh and energized.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nancy-Wallpaper.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31088 mb-0 size-chrono" title="black-white-wall-gray-backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nancy-Wallpaper.gif" alt="black and white walled kitchen with gray backsplash and white kitchen cabinets after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With limited square footage, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/movie-set-comes-life-studio-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nancy</a> knew that bold colors would make her kitchen feel cramped. Instead, a fun wallpaper with a dizzying array of black dots across a white backdrop makes a lively addition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28322" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavi’s kitchen</a>, the new backsplash provides plenty of drama. White subway tiles were replaced with a kaleidoscope of black, gray, and white triangular tiles for a look that’s modern and luxe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A couple creates their dream home with walnut wood floors, a spa bath, and enough kitchen storage to turn heads</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">A year-long search—involving a specially-written code!—led Jonathan, a consultant, and Cecilia, a social media strategist and <a href="https://cecibeautytherapy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">beauty blogger</span></a>, to a mid-century co-op apartment in Queens. The unit was in a serious state of disrepair, with cracked doors and windows and a dangerously unstable kitchen countertop. Read about how the couple changed the floor plan, turned a powder room into a full spa bath, and created a space to suit their lifestyle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24316 mb-0 size-chrono" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-20.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Prior to moving in together, Jonathan and his girlfriend, Cecilia, were each living in Manhattan on the Lower East Side. The criteria for their search? He wanted a large space and a fixer upper with a good school district; she wanted the convenience of a supermarket, shops, and a subway stop close by. Their budget had them looking in Windsor Terrace, Forest Hills, Sunnyside, and Hamilton Heights, in addition to Elmhurst. For their search, Jonathan used his background in quantitative finance to adapt code that he had written to find his first apartment in 2008, which scoured the major real estate websites for properties that fit their fairly strict criteria and price range. The code took into account various factors, such as home value increase over time, new developments, transit efficiency, growth in commercial investments, and the neighborhood’s increasing value over five-plus years. When this apartment came up—roughly a year after they started searching—it was way under budget, and the couple pounced on the opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The space was located in a very convenient neighborhood in Elmhurst, with shops and necessities nearby and just a 25-minute subway ride from midtown. They purchased the 1960s-era apartment with the intention to renovate. The reasonable price meant there was enough left over to splurge on the renovations, so they planned to add their own personal touch with high-end finishes. At roughly 1,300 square feet, the 3-bed, 1.5-bath co-op was more space than they expected to find, and the layout allowed them to implement some drastic changes to make the space more usable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/before-floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24365 size-chrono" title="before floorplan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/before-floorplan-723x760.jpg" alt="before floorplan" width="723" height="760" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/after-floorplan-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24374 size-chrono" title="after floorplan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/after-floorplan-1-723x760.jpg" alt="after floorplan" width="723" height="760" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24318 size-chrono" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-01-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24319 mb-0 size-chrono" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Jonathan and Cecilia could see that the apartment had good bones. Despite the positives, it was extremely outdated and many things—such as the cabinets, heaters, windows, and doors—were falling apart. The kitchen counter would teeter if you placed any weight on it, and would even come off its foundation if you pressed down. The previous owners had done unpermitted renovations in the past, and the apartment had not been well taken care of. The original layout had long narrow halls, closets in weird places, a closed kitchen, and cramped rooms. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Initially, Jonathan looked for contractors on his own, until an architect friend told him about Sweeten. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">He posted his project</span></a> and wrote up his description. He said, “I received a lot of quick responses—more than me going out on my own, and the bids were much more competitive than any from my own research. The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Sweeten contractor</span></a> that I went with was a one-stop shop for everything. He had an architect, a designer, and a project manager—they pretty much did all the heavy lifting. They were super responsive and took care of a lot of the issues that arose throughout the process. Knowing that they have been vetted through Sweeten definitely gave me peace of mind.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Jonathan and his Sweeten contractor set out to solve problems related to space usability and efficiency, and to make the apartment feel more open and modern. They decided that if a wall could be knocked down, they would do it. They turned hallways into closets and closets into open spaces. They also wanted to convert the half bath into a second full bath—Cecilia already claimed the first one, so Jonathan needed one of his own!</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Given their preference for clean lines with modern touches, they did not want too much in terms of the built-ins and crown molding. “The kitchen was the part of the renovation we were most excited about. Because Cecilia loves to cook and I like to entertain, we wanted people to naturally gather around the kitchen for good food, good drinks, and good times,” says Jonathan. With dark furniture in the rest of the apartment, they went for white shaker cabinets, gray-white texture on the backsplash and white counters with a bit of speckling for an overall contrasting look. Appliances were stainless steel and marble was installed wherever possible. An incredible amount of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> and counter space was added, with every inch of space maximized.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-08-11.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24327 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-08-11.gif" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-13-14.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24326 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-13-14.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A pull-out spice rack</a> and deep drawers were among the storage solutions they chose. “Having those large drawers for pots and pans with the ability to customize the holders was a must. A floor-to-ceiling pantry with pull-out drawers made our snacking life that much easier. We decided on open shelving in select areas to make the kitchen feel more open. A pass-through was also created, so a spot on the living room side was used for counter seating. We wanted large appliances to really be the wow factor in our kitchen. I love our five-burner stove—especially the griddle!—and our massive fridge and great dishwasher. Having this generously proportioned kitchen and large-scale appliances has been amazing, especially compared to our previous apartments,” explains Jonathan.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24330 size-chrono" title="before bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-Before-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="before bathroom" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-During-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24329 size-chrono" title="during bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-During-04-723x482.jpg" alt="during bathroom" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24331 size-chrono" title="bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-15-723x1085.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24332 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the original full bath—Cecilia’s bathroom—they went with a white theme. She wanted it to be bright and classy, so they chose glossy white marble <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tile for the floors</a> and large-format porcelain tile for the walls, with an accent wall of marble 2-inch subway tile laid in a herringbone pattern. This gave the space more texture and made it feel more custom. They also added a niche for toiletries and bath products.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24333 size-chrono" title="spa bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17-723x1085.jpg" alt="spa bath renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24334 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spa bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-18-723x1085.jpg" alt="spa bath renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the second bath, Jonathan added a large shower by taking some space from the master bedroom closet. “Since it was my bathroom, I had full reign and wanted it to resemble a spa.” The Sweeten contractor added slate tiles throughout, as well as a pebbled shower floor and a large shower panel with rainfall and waterfall features. In both baths, they installed tankless <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilets</a> per co-op requirements.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-03-04-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24378 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-03-04-2.gif" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24335 mb-0 size-chrono" title="office renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="office renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Throughout the apartment, they had originally planned on going with light bamboo flooring. When their Sweeten design/build firm sent over samples of both light and dark wood, however, they fell in love with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dark walnut flooring</a> from Triangulo. For the office space, they decided on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French doors</a> to allow some openness between the living room and office, while providing privacy if needed when Jonathan worked from home in the evenings.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The biggest challenges of the project related to changes to their original design: “A lot of it was due to unforeseen circumstances,&#8221; Jonathan explains. &#8220;The original broker stretched the truth about where pipes were, what construction was done legally, what was underneath the floors, as well as what we would be permitted to do. We originally had a plan that was going to be signed off, but once we contacted the live-in super, problems started to arise. We had to do two to three different drafts, which caused scheduling delays as well as caused friction with the co-op board and staff. The entire process took about two months just to get approval because of these issues. Eventually, we got everything set up, and once construction started, there were only a few slight hiccups. Everything went fairly smoothly.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">After finishing the renovation, Jonathan’s recommendation to future renovators is to be open and flexible with the initial vision. “Most people have an idea of how exactly they want things, and are unwilling to do something different or new. That’s good but rarely does your budget or space allow you to have everything that you want. I originally wanted to remove some of our closets because I thought we had too many, but my girlfriend and designer suggested that we keep them for both value and utility. Having lived here for six months, I can safely say that I’m glad we kept the closets.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Jonathan feared that the end product wouldn’t match up to his vision. He and Cecilia have very different design aesthetics, and he wasn’t sure if they would mesh well together. “In the end, I think the apartment has a good flow and calming color tones, which is something nice to come home to after a hectic day. Another big question I had was whether we could actually do everything in the timeframe the contractors set out—about four to five months. It was an ambitious schedule, and while there were small items that needed to be addressed after we moved in, they were minor. In the end, we completed the project on deadline, and are very happy with how it turned out.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Brooklyn cookspace pivots big-time by adding a peninsula, impressive kitchen storage—and yes, pulling down the ceiling</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24130 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-09-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span class="s2">: Reimagine kitchen storage and appliances in <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span class="s2">: The family of four—Emily, Trey, and their two sons—spent almost five years in their downtown Brooklyn condo before pulling the trigger on a kitchen renovation. By then, Emily, who cooks dinner about five times a week, knew she really needed a double oven and more efficient kitchen storage—their open shelving would never look clean and organized the way she wanted. The current oven couldn’t even fit a cookie tray and the tiny dishwasher measured only 18 inches across. The kitchen lights above flickered and a lowered ceiling—thanks to a loft overhead—made for a dark and oppressive space. “We put stuff up there that we hardly touched the entire time we have lived here,” said Emily. The style was a strange mix of wood and stainless steel, including an industrial-style sink that was reminiscent of an operating table.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: A problem area in the renovation was the intercom attached to a pole that sat in a prominent spot in the kitchen. It could not be moved according to the building’s alteration agreement. The family’s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s4">Sweeten contractor</span></a> ended up working the peninsula around the pole. That wide and bright L-shaped peninsula also became the perfect meeting place for the couple’s two kids to sit while Emily cooks. With the storage loft gone and the ceiling raised, the kitchen is unrecognizable. The relatively small space (about 8’ x 10’) prompted the new design to utilize every inch of the space. The plan for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen storage</a> included cupboards in two dead corners—one at the end of the peninsula and another behind the far left bar stool. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Near the completion of the project, Emily fell in love with some yellow <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pendant lights</a>. However, the color clashed with the vibrant blue backsplash tiles that were all set to be installed. Instead, Emily swapped it for a muted gray backsplash tile and the non-refundable blue ones will likely become a feature of an upcoming bathroom renovation.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Compact kitchen overhaul in an Upper West Side high-rise studio</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Despite its condition, the owner, who works in real estate, actually remembers his old 85-square-foot kitchen with surprising fondness. Beneath a harsh fluorescent fixture, low-end plastic laminate cabinets and counters were worn and stained. Above the 1980’s white stove, the hood’s exposed exhaust hose was sloppily sealed using pieces of tape. The floor was a dated black-and-white resilient tile checkerboard.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: The delighted owner notes that this “reno way exceeded my expectations.” As his Sweeten profile requested, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his contractor</a> handled the co-op’s intimidating application process. None of the appliances or worn-out finishes were worth saving—only the new refrigerator was relocated. Glossy modern white cabinets make the space feel less narrow than brown wood upper cabinets could have. Undercabinet LED lights shine onto the engineered quartz countertop. The undulating wall tiles were found on a showroom shopping trip with his contractor, and the owner first saw large-format slate-look floor tiles on design blogs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The contractor’s cabinetmaker matched the budget-friendly veneer so that the grain continues from one section of lower cabinets to the next without interruption.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Style finds</span>: 30-inch gas <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/products/cooking-baking/ranges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a> slide-in stainless range; <a href="https://www.samsung.com/levant/refrigerators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a> refrigerator; <a href="https://www.sharpusa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharp</a> microwave; <a href="https://www.kraususa.com/kitchen/kitchen-sinks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Krauss</a> under-mount stainless sink; backsplash tile by <a href="https://www.wowdesigneu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WOW Design EU</a>; American Standard one-hole deck-mount chrome faucet from <a href="https://www.americanstandard-us.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Standard</a>; engineered countertop in Pearl White from <a href="https://pentalquartz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pental</a>; <a href="https://zephyronline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zephyr</a> Breeze recirculating hood.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Vivid proof there’s more to kitchen design than all-white</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There&#8217;s a reason why so many renovators prefer neutrals. Soft shades of cream and linen, or cloud-gray and pewter, never go out of style. But they can also feel a little flat. Injecting a bright color into your space adds a splash of personality. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors—outlines some of our favorite ways that homeowners have brought color into their kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23361 mb-0 size-chrono" title="teal backsplash and walnut cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen color ideas" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Janna_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-sheds-deli-style-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janna and Jeremy&#8217;s</a> kitchen, the only storage options were a shelving unit and one, lonely cabinet that had to do the work of a full set. “We joked that it looked like a corner deli,” Janna reminisces. A patterned teal backsplash provides just enough interest—in addition to walnut cabinets—to take the kitchen from deli-style to dazzling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Matthieu_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25799 mb-0 size-chrono" title="coral accent wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Matthieu_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen color ideas" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Modern design, combined with a stark palette, runs the risk of making your space feel a little cold. The owners of this <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/modern-kitchen-tile-backsplash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton Hill kitchen</a> incorporated a coral accent wall to inject plenty of warmth. Painting a single wall is a simple way to infuse personality, and if you ever get tired of the shade, you can easily change it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28402 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue walls in a galley kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen color ideas" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tile isn&#8217;t the only option when it comes to bringing color to your backsplash. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/manhattan-kitchen-remodel-turns-true-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rashmi</a> chose a peacock-blue semi-gloss paint for the walls of her kitchen, a choice that makes wiping them down a piece of cake. Plus, the cool hue contrasts beautifully with her warm, gold-toned cabinet hardware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20253 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bright blue lower cabinets paired with white upper cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen color ideas" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re feeling bold, colorful cabinets are the way to go. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikki and Chris</a> selected a brilliant shade of blue for their lower cabinets, balancing the bold choice with white upper cabinets. The approach feels stylish and chic without becoming overwhelming. Brushed brass hardware and a champagne-gold faucet are the perfect complements to the jewel-tone hue.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28089 mb-0 size-chrono" title="a riot of colorful cabinets and accent walls" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen color ideas" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_EricaDonnaApt-09.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re not afraid of color, go big! A well-balanced palette, like this combo of Benjamin Moore&#8217;s Juniper and Citron, paired with Farrow &amp; Ball&#8217;s Light Blue for the cabinets, is just the right amount of light and dark, bright and subdued. Nearby white walls and wood floors anchor the vibrant colors, elevating them to contemporary flair in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brooklyn-interior-design-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Donna&#8217;s</a> kitchen.</p>
