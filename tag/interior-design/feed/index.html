			<h2>7 renewed living room spaces offer ideas for relaxing and gathering</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="brick-highlight-wall-and-furniture"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-11.jpg" alt="Brick hightlight wall in a living room complete with furniture after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51539" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Rivaled only by the kitchen and bedroom, the living room is where you spend most of your time. So, designing it to match your lifestyle and personal aesthetic is key. Here, see how seven homeowners with unique modern living room ideas reimagined their spaces. From large open-concept layouts to smaller spots with creative uses of space, aspiring renovators can find inspiration at every turn.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3><strong>Cottage-style living room inspires a calm aesthetic</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-living-room-blue-couch"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1.jpg" alt="white living room with blue and red couch and white floor rug on wooden floor and large window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-50372 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Part of a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/charm-queens-row-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-home remodel, this living room</a> turned from dated to dreamy. Homeowner Monique always loved the idea of a cottage-style home. So, when she bought her 1940s row house in Queens, she hired a Sweeten contractor to help realize her vision. They ripped up the carpet floors to expose beautiful hardwood and chose a classic walnut stain. To make the room appear larger, her contractor suggested opening up the archway between the entry and living room. Plus, they installed European tilt-and-turn style windows.</p>
<p>The result is a living room that has Monique’s desired aesthetic (cottage meets modern) and is bigger and brighter. “My renovated space feels like a peaceful retreat,” says Monique. “I love how welcoming and warm it feels for my friends and their kids to come and hang out.”</p>
<h3><strong>Art deco arches uplift this living room</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="living-room-arched-entryway"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-05.jpg" alt="living room with arched entryway and hanging pendant lights after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-49486 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>What stands out the most in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/an-architect-guided-art-deco-renovation-for-a-queens-townhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this living room remodel is immediately clear:</a> the stunning art deco archways. When their clients hired Can Vu Bui and Lane Rick, <span>principal architects at the <a href="https://oo-t.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of Things</a>, they asked them to reimagine the main floor of their 1920s rowhouse. And that they did! From front-to-back, they incorporated Art Deco details, like the arches you see in the living room. This helped to bring in space and light, which was the main goal. “We replaced the existing walls with elegant structural arches,” says Bui. The space went from dreary to cheery. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Elegant seating with a view</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a.jpg" alt="Glam style living room with floor-to-ceiling curtains and natural light" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-37459 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/kips-bay-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room in this Kips Bay, Manhattan apartment</a> had good bones. It was already, spacious so no walls needed to be knocked down to increase its square footage. It featured a stunning wall of windows and original hardwood floors. The challenge for interior designer Tara Benet was to refresh this tired living room, last renovated 30 years ago.</p>
<p>To help her do so, she hired a Sweeten contractor. Together, they transformed a dull space into a work of art. They started by removing the old track lighting (nothing dates a place more than bad lighting!) The ceiling was concrete so they couldn’t install recessed lighting. The workaround? Two gorgeous chandeliers that do double duty. They effectively light the room and provide a beautiful focal point.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-07-1.jpg" alt="Closeup of modern living room coffee table with flower vase and modern white sofa" width="1000" height="1250" class="alignnone wp-image-35657 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-07-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-07-1-240x300.jpg 240w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-07-1-600x750.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-07-1-723x904.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-07-1-585x731.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooring also needed to be redone</a>. The original area rug was in the same spot for nearly 30 years. The intense UV rays faded the varnish over the years, leaving the flooring two-toned. The fix was to re-sand and re-varnish the entire floor in a light stain to add a fresh look. Benet also selected a white, with a slight orange base, for the walls. The result: a mix of muted and rich hues of blue and gold for a modern aesthetic that pops.</p>
<h3><strong>A small but spunky studio apartment</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12.jpg" alt="Modern living room in studio apartment with bold red sofa and black accents" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-46927 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The apartment itself may be small, but the living room’s design is big in style. Taylor turned to Sweeten to find a contractor to help renovate <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovating-a-hand-me-down-co-op-during-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her family’s 320-square-foot Manhattan studio.</a> She knew it wasn’t going to be her forever home, so she renovated with that in mind. She was delighted when her contractor found curved pass-throughs underneath drywall and paneling. “It was great to find a bit of the apartment’s charm still intact,” said Taylor. She also ripped out the paneling and updated the dark teal walls.</p>
<p>Before the remodel, she said it felt a little like a “dungeon.” But by opting for a lighter color for the walls, it instantly brightened up the space. She gave it a modern feel by painting the window trim in a contemporary charcoal shade.</p>
<h3><strong>A Hollywood star gets a new living room for a growing family</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-17.jpg" alt="Image of a modern living room renovation for Jaime Ray Newman" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-46474 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Like so many other homeowners,<em> Little Fires Everywhere</em> actress Jaime Ray Newman and her husband <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dreamed of renovating their home</a>. But when the couple discovered they were expecting their second, they realized it was time. “It was now or never,” says Newman. “We knew that with two kids, we’d want an open floor plan.” So, they hired a designer and a Sweeten contractor and got to work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-06.jpg" alt="ranch home renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46463" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The result is a living room that is both stylish and functional for her young family. The room seamlessly flows into the kitchen and dining area for much-needed clear sightlines. A gray sectional ties into the gray and white cabinets of the kitchen while a console with wood doors complements the nearby dining table. The actor and producer have this advice for those thinking of renovating. “These are massive decisions that you can’t turn back on, so hire a designer if you have doubts,” she says. “And hire a contractor whose aesthetic you love.”</p>
<h3>Reproducing the look and feel of a modern hotel</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-03.jpg" alt="A modern Williamsburg loft living room with blue velvet couch" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-45649 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Wife and husband duo, Keren and Thomas Richter, run White Arrow, a design firm in NYC. Their client, a successful digital agency founder, wanted his <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-williamsburg-studio-goes-boutique-hotel-chic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooklyn apartment to have the essence</a> of a sophisticated, urban hotel. He was used to traveling for work and this aesthetic spoke to him. One of the challenges was the narrow layout of the ground floor. A positive was the high ceilings, but the small, tight space also had what Richter explains as “a disjointed arrangement of extrusions and unflattering angles.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-01.jpg" alt="Living room with double height loft ceilings and gold lighting fixture" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-45647 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>They worked with a Sweeten contractor to fix this. Design techniques were employed to make the space feel wider and more expansive. For example, they bleached the floors to make them lighter. They also white-washed the exposed brick for a more modern feel. And finally, added dramatic chandeliers and sconces to draw the eye up. “The designs are super smart and well-executed,” the homeowner says. “I am really happy.”</p>
<h3>A multi-functional family room</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-living-room-with-couch"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-10.jpg" alt="White living room with couch and armchairs with brick wallpapers after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51540" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-loft-in-a-former-silk-warehouse-gets-a-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara and Ryan decided to live</a> in their outdated loft in Soho for a few years before making the decision to renovate. When the couple found out they were going to have a baby, they sprung into action. They needed a space that was conducive to their new family life. Tara and Ryan hired a Sweeten contractor to re-imagine their 1,200-square-foot apartment.</p>
<p>In addition to a kitchen and bathroom remodel, the couple wanted a functional family/living room. &#8220;The vision was to embrace the original loft aesthetic with an industrial-meets-modern design,&#8221; said Tara. &#8220;We wanted to re-expose the brick along the entire length of the living room wall.&#8221; This gave it the updated industrial look they desired. This long wall also allowed them to add much-needed storage. They had built-ins installed, which are perfect for storing toys, books, and other household items. It is now an ideal family room—both beautiful and functional.</p>

			<h2 class="p1">From efficient ADUs to spa-like bathrooms, home interior design in Los Angeles points to simplicity, utility, and going traditional</h2>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46811 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg" alt="bedroom remodel for actress Jaime Ray Newman los angeles" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">Diversity is king when it comes to home interior design in Los Angeles. The city has a sense of history, with styles spanning Spanish Colonial to Mission Revival, Beaux-Arts to Art Deco, Hollywood Regency to streamline 1930s modern. The desire to preserve those design styles is strong, as is the need to make homes liveable for today. H<span>ome renovation design trends in Los Angeles</span> and what rooms and features are important have shifted nationwide. Fortunately, for LA contractors and designers, remodeling has not missed a beat.</p>

<h3>Changes and challenges: Home interior design in Los Angeles</h3>
<p class="p2">“We didn’t really see much of a change,” said Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5968#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA general contractor Trevor</a>. “It&#8217;s just a redirect.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The challenge is more about materials shortages, delays, and rising costs</span><span class="s2">.</span> “The cost of lumber is affecting building,” said Trevor. Sheet plywood, for example, has jumped from $18 to around $50, he said. “People are asking for alternatives to lumber, like tin framing used in commercial.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">A renewed focus on outdoor living</h3>
<p class="p2">“A lot more people are fixing their exterior,” said Trevor. “People want to spend money on outdoor hardscapes, swimming pools. In LA, that’s where you spend 60 percent of your time.”</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.cozystylishchic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA-based designer Jeanne Chung</a> agreed. “It’s all about indoor-outdoor living,” she said. NanaWalls, which fold in and extend the indoor space out to patios, are very popular. “They double the square footage of eating and entertaining areas,” said Jeanne.</p>
<p class="p2">The bonus of adding windows, especially large ones to foster the indoor/outdoor connection is gaining more natural light.</p>
<p class="p2">Homeowners are also investing in <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor rooms</a>. Pools, water features, outdoor kitchens, firepits, and extensive seating and dining areas are high on wish lists. Materials are more organic, “definitely going back to nature.” Trevor is using a lot of textured cement, stamped, and honed finishes. “A salt finish really is big. With mid-century design, there’s a lot of tile work. We do ipe wood outdoors and a type of red hardwood that is slightly less hard than ipe, but about half the price.”</p>
<h3 class="p5">ADUs and additions for more square footage</h3>
<p class="p2">One rising trend for home interior design in Los Angeles is remodeling ADUs (accessory dwelling units). “It’s generating the <span style="color: #333333;">biggest buzz,” said <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor Trevor. </span>These detached structures, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often garages</a>, are repurposed as guest houses, rentals, or home offices.</p>
<p class="p2">Many of her clients are adding to the existing footprint. “They’re knocking out walls to create a little extra space, as in bathrooms, for example.”</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg" alt="Modern living room with glass walls and modern gray fireplace" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirsty and David&#8217;s</a> Mid-City/Miracle Mile home in LA</span></p>
<p class="p2">“You can build a second story,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “It’s contingent on the footprint of the existing structure. A lot are pushed outside of the setback, so they go high vertically. People are going for the max. It’s getting a lot of value on the price for square foot.” If you&#8217;re planning on expanding or remodeling a kitchen or bathroom (more on them below), look for a vetted general contractor that is licensed. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor in LA</a> with experience will guide you through the process.</p>
<h3>Keeping kitchens fresh and updated</h3>
<p class="p6">“It’s where you get the most <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bang for the buck</a>,” said Trevor. The remodel here may happen more frequently than in other parts of the country. Apparently, design fatigue sets in earlier. He has <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to kitchens</a> remodeled just two years before for a refresh. “It’s like changing wardrobes.”</p>
<p class="p2">LA kitchens tend to be large, mostly open plan, and gourmet with top-of-the-line professional appliances. But there’s not as much carving, ornate moldings, over-the-top use of stones. Instead, there’s more of a creative mix of materials. At the same time, the goal is more making it your own with custom looks—tile backsplashes, bold color ranges, and stove hoods.</p>

<h4>Top kitchen materials to watch</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Cabinets. Simple clean-lined styles are flat-panel and frameless. Hardware is modern, sculptural, or jewelry-like. Otherwise, there are hidden touch latches. Wood is finding competition in painted finishes, mostly in soothing livable shades.</li>
<li class="p2">Island culture. Some islands are getting bigger, some are multi-level for different functions. Waterfall sides on islands are popular.</li>
<li class="p2">Appliances. Pro-style ranges favor stylish brands like cooktops and ovens from Wolf, Monogram by GE, LaCornue, and Lacanche. The desire to cook healthy promotes features like special burners for woks, steam cooking. Some ranges even have an integrated sous vide. The slow cooking in a vacuum-sealed bag retains more nutrients, uses less oil, fat, and salt.</li>
<li class="p2">Porcelain and quartz are gaining in popularity because of the similar looks to stone without the maintenance. Large slabs and large format tiles offer a seamless installation with no grout lines to break up the design. Matte finishes have overtaken shiny ones.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">“Here in LA, my clients don’t want polished,” said Jeanne. “I am using concrete-looking porcelain slabs and cement tiles.” Jeanne seals her concrete to guard against staining because it’s pretty porous.</p>
<h4>Finishes lead the way</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Color is taking a turn. Moody, dark colors—black, deep blues, and bottle greens—are ramping up, said Sweeten contractor Trevor. They pair well with burnished or brushed gold. “I do a lot of antiqued blue—like a muted denim—with brass pulls,” he said.</li>
<li class="p2">Lighter woods seem to suit the lighter mood of interiors. That goes for cabinets as well as flooring. Wide plank wood floors are on trend—with an average of 7&#8243;—and in French oak whitewashed finishes, cappuccino, some with a hint of gray.</li>
<li class="p2">Gold touch. LA homeowners are opting more for burnished and brushed gold finishes in cabinet hardware, faucets, and lighting. Some appliance manufacturers now include brass pulls as options. But mixing gold, especially with black matte, is very chic. Mixing metals adds interest to the design, especially in kitchens, where there is a lot of cabinetry.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">The spa bath is redefined</h3>
<p class="p2">In Los Angeles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgrading the whole bathroom</a> means incorporating a level of comfort. Freestanding tubs provide a visual <i>tour de force</i>. Most often they are made of stone, porcelain, quartz, or resin, so the shape lends a sculptural note. Large curbless walk-in showers are distinguished with surface materials. Linear drains are trending because they are more aesthetically pleasing. Rain showers are favored, but you won’t find multiple showerheads due to water restrictions. Floors often are radiant heated.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="gray-vanity-marble-countertop-hanging-mirror" class="alignnone wp-image-50847 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918.jpg" alt="large gray single vanity with white marble countertop and brushed nickel hardware and gold faucet and fixtures and hanging circular mirror infront of window after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Variations of brass finishes in this LA renovation by designer Jeanne Chung. Photos by Peter Christiansen Valli. </span></p>
<p class="p2">The divide—choosing between tub and shower—is more about personal preferences. Many see the sculptural artistry of the tub as adding to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return on investment</a>. Radiant heat is also a value-added. An alternative to slab stone walls is large-format porcelain tile. These tiles, with a range of looks that mimic various stones, come in similar slab formats.</p>
<p class="p2">More than ever, the bath is <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered an oasis</a>. The overall style may be elegant, but again, the overall look is simplified, with cleaner, more modern lines.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Ensuite bedrooms are preferred to mega-size closets</h3>
<p class="p2">Jeanne said her clients would rather have larger bedrooms with sitting areas than supersized closets. Still, walk-in closets are on remodeling wish lists.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Storage is key</h3>
<p class="p2">Unseen compartments in drawers or cubbies in cabinetry and built-in benches corral stuff to keep spaces visually clean.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49429 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg" alt="Modern kitchen with exposed beams and stacked washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"></span></p>

<h3 class="p2">Mudrooms are still going strong</h3>
<p class="p2">Although some trend forecasters suggest the demise of these transitional spaces for hanging coats and dropping gear, Jeanne said not so in LA. “Especially with the pandemic,” she said, “There’s a desire for bigger mudrooms. It’s like a decontamination area—coming into the home, taking off all your grimy stuff.” Typical layouts include hanging storage behind doors, cubbies, and benches for putting on shoes or boots. Some incorporate pet stations.</p>
<h3 class="p2">There’s an uptick in requests for libraries</h3>
<p class="p2">“It’s a very popular room right now,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “It’s only going to get more popular. I’ve had three customers recently tell me they want libraries—real traditional, with everything built in.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">Home offices are making a comeback</h3>
<p class="p2">The Zoom fatigue is real, but so is the realization that the backdrop for those visual calls needs to step up. Jeanne recently had a request from a wife to make her husband’s office more fashionable—because of his frequent video calls.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Ongoing remodeling trends consistent in LA</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li class="p2">Going green and sustainability is much more in demand with a more conscious effort to utilize eco-friendly materials as well as those that save energy.</li>
<li class="p2">Smart home. Automation adjusts to temperature, lighting, and security. Smart devices even monitor cooking.</li>
<li class="p2">A few things to consider when remodeling in LA: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seismic codes</a> that require tall stem walls, slab on grade with thick foundations in order to guard against earthquake damage. Also, water restriction dictates the kinds of showers allowed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="p2">Classic and traditional design emerges</h3>
<p>For home interior design in Los Angeles, Trevor also said that there appears to be a return to more traditional design.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p2">“Mid-century modern has always been huge like ranch home designs,” he said. &#8220;But traditional design is coming back—I would call it a mix between mid-century, Dutch, and American traditional. Recently I’ve been seeing yellow and some of the 70s colors coming back.”</li>
<li class="p2">Statement decorating is hot. It’s part of the remodel plan. It could be a feature wall, a painted mural, or wallcovering. It could be a pop of color in a professional range or a graphic patterned tile on a backsplash. Outdoors, it might be a pergola, water, or fire feature.</li>
<li class="p2">There’s an appreciation for artisanal looks. Handmade tiles, handcrafted hardware lend personality to interiors. Some renovation inspiration comes from restaurant and hotel design.</li>
<li class="p2">“Simplicity—we’re definitely going in that direction,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “Not so much baroque-style with lots of moldings. People are going functional. They want hip and stylish.” There’s a minimalist sensibility, but not in the spare extreme.</li>
<li class="p2">California style—with a modern or rustic refined look—still is strong, with lighter bleached look woods and ceiling beams.</li>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Meredith-BathroomKitchen-07.jpg" alt="Blue and white bathroom with long double sink and glass shower door after renovation " width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49205" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Meredith-BathroomKitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Meredith-BathroomKitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Meredith-BathroomKitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Seemingly minor design changes can shift a room&#8217;s entire aesthetic. Case in point: black window frames. They not only act as a frame to a picture-perfect outdoor view but also dress up a plain wall. Take a look at these six Sweeten projects to see how the homeowners incorporated black window frames into a variety of homes.</p>

<h3>Small-space solution: Black-framed windows</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12.jpg" alt="studio apartment" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46927" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Black-framed window trim made this studio apartment look bigger and brighter. During her Sweeten renovation, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovating-a-hand-me-down-co-op-during-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taylor decided on painting the window frames black</a> for a striking effect. This design idea brought a modern and elegant look to her 320-square-foot home.</p>
<h3>Interior window frames upgrade a townhouse</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After23.jpg" alt="White living room with curtains on french window and a blue couch after renovation " width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50805" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After23.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After23-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-bronx-rowhouse-remodel-for-work-life-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve and Lewis created several windows with black frames</a>. From the inside and the exterior, the unique configuration would add character to their renovated townhouse. The framed windows visually connect the urban activity outside.</p>
<h3>Painting window frames black adds charm to a Tudor</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="farmhouse-sink-with-granite-counter" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-49205 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Meredith-BathroomKitchen-07.jpg" alt="Blue and white bathroom with long double sink and glass shower door after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Meredith-BathroomKitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Meredith-BathroomKitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Meredith-BathroomKitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Classic black-painted window frames fit all styles from apartments to older houses. Sweeten homeowner and interior designer <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meredith knew black trim would make the mark</a>. She noted how “they fit the Tudor style of the house perfectly.” The finished window acts as a visual anchor for the bathroom.</p>
<h3>Dark window framing complements intricate detail</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25574 size-full" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-04.jpg" alt="Brooklyn brownstone" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry went with deep bluish-black molding</a> for their dining room area. The contrast emphasized the intricate stained glass.  “We love this room,” Nazli said, explaining how it was the main reason they bought the house.</p>

<p>Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellamy and Zak replaced all the windows in their house</a>, creating an entirely new view. Painted black-framed windows invite the outside in. With this integral detail, these homeowners were able to create a timeless look that appeals to the eye.</p>
<h3>Bringing the outside in</h3>

<p>Black-framed windows highlight expansive light in a 1932 Dutch Colonial.

A wall-to-wall, ceiling-to-floor set of glass doors set the stage for a grand picture window to the outdoors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>There&#8217;s no need to have a green thumb to enjoy indoor plants at home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether clustered together in a nook or dispersed among various rooms, p<span class="s1">lants let you enjoy the beauty of an indoor garden year round</span>. Beneficial for your health and your living space, they soften the corners of a room,<span class="s1"> work with any color palette</span>, purify the air, and, some experts say, can help reduce stress. We love seeing Sweeten homes filled with greenery, so we set out to discover what kinds of indoor plants our homeowners keep in their homes and how to care for them with advice from Justin Hancock, a professional horticulturist and garden expert at <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costa Farms</a>. Below are a crop of our favorite plant-filled renovations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23098 size-chrono" title="A snake plant" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="indoor plants" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/apartment-party-four-five/">Samantha’s kitchen</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re looking for a good indoor plant for the kitchen, look no further than the <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/snake-plant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snake plant</a>. In Samantha’s kitchen, the greenery adds a decorative touch to the island while breaking up the gray and neutral tones of the space. Also known as mother-in-law&#8217;s tongue, it enjoys the extra humidity a kitchen offers and doesn&#8217;t need to be watered regularly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25816 size-chrono" title="A fiddle leaf fig tree" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="indoor plants" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brett’s living room</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fiddle leaf fig tree in Brett’s living room complements the wall of exposed brick beautifully while the height of the tree makes great use of the tall ceilings. It also acts as a visual barrier between the living room and kitchen, defining each space while allowing them to remain open. Fiddle leaf fig trees love bright, indirect light, so keep it in a sunny room away from windows and be sure to water it whenever the soil feels dry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-08-8.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21670 size-chrono" title="A collection of plants" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-08-8-723x1085.jpg" alt="indoor plants" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/fashion-designer-renovates-match-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine’s living room</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A wall of exposed red brick in Christine’s living room inspired her to recreate a Moroccan riad—or home with an interior garden. A variety of indoor plants, layered to add depth and visual interest, creates a private retreat within the home. The collection includes a <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/get-growing/news/a-guide-to-growing-majesty-palms-indoors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majesty palm</a>, a Red Congo <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/philodendron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">philodendron</a>, a <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/monstera" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monstera</a>, and <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/ponytail-palm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ponytail palm</a>, to name a few. All of these plants need to be watered whenever the top of the soil begins to feel dry and do their best in sunny spots around the home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-04-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21665 size-chrono" title="A hanging pothos" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-04-17-723x1085.jpg" alt="indoor plants" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/fashion-designer-renovates-match-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine’s bathroom</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When adding a plant to your bathroom, it’s important to find one that can tolerate steam and a high level of humidity. The <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/pothos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pothos</a> plant is the perfect candidate, pictured here in Christine’s bathroom. Hang it from the ceiling and make your bathroom feel like a secret oasis. Also, keeping it in the bathroom is a great way to make watering it super easy; keep the soil moist, but not saturated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24715 mb-24 size-chrono" title="A corn plant in the corner" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-31-723x1085.jpg" alt="indoor plants" width="723" height="1085" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brett’s bedroom</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/schefflera" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schefflera arboricola</a> on the windowsill, a <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/corn-plant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corn plant</a> in the corner, and a <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/plants/dieffenbachia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dieffenbachia</a> on a small side table add a bright boost to Brett’s all-white bedroom. Treat them as decorative elements and mix different species of plants in one room; choose a few varieties that need the same amount of light and water so it’s easy to remember what to do. In this case, these indoor plants benefit from a lot of light and a weekly watering.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>A pothos is a beautiful way to add some greenery to your bathroom; you can hang it from the ceiling or place it in a corner and wrap the vines around your bath like <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/pallavi-keyurs-manhattan-apartment-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pallavi and Keyur</a> did.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each week we visit a member of Sweeten network to check out what they are working on. This week we&#8217;re with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ishka Designs</a>.  Anishka &amp; Niya, interior design partners &amp; founders of Ishka Designs, are in the construction phase of a 4,000 sqft medical facility in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.  Working in close collaboration with the client, a medical doctor who offers holistic healing services, the designers will bring this facility well beyond the &#8216;traditional&#8217; by addressing the needs of a holistic design approach. They are utilizing spatial devices such as light, materials, plantings, sensors, etc., to create a clean, ambient environment for the new facility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each week we visit a member of Sweeten network to check out what they are working on. This week we&#8217;re in Bed Stuy Brooklyn with <a href="https://sweeten.com/">South Fork Tile</a>. The owner (<a href="https://sweeten.com/about">Jean</a>!) of this wood-frame house was looking to finish her kitchen by adding floor to ceiling subway tiles. She chose a medium grey grout and bright white tile to compliment the countertops and flooring. The project was completed in a day and a half by South Fork Tile owner Gennadiy Kaliberda. After years of practice and hundreds of kitchens this was a pretty easy project for him, so this left lots of time to hear about his tiling adventures across the country.</p>

<p>I am not a tree-hugger. I like the idea of nature, but I like it best when witnessed from the confines of <a href="https://www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a lovely glass box</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless I&#8217;m studying for the <a href="https://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEED</a> accreditation exam, which demonstrates leadership in the design and construction of buildings that promote energy-efficiency and resource conservation. The exam covers a lot of dry technical information, and I&#8217;m undertaking it mostly because the credential has become de rigeur for architects. But all this studying has gotten me thinking more seriously about the facts underlying the formulae. I&#8217;m becoming increasingly ecologically-sensitive about the way I live and the products I use.</p>
<p>So more than six months after I completed my kitchen and bathroom remodel I&#8217;m feeling a load of green remorse, disappointment that I wasn&#8217;t more environmentally responsible when selecting products and finishes. So many building products claim that they&#8217;re &#8220;green&#8221; now that it&#8217;s easy to dismiss as a trendy marketing tactic. But each shift in product manufacturing and purchasing, however small, contributes to a much larger shift in consumption that can help us protect our resources.</p>
<p>Here are some things I&#8217;ll do differently the next time I remodel:</p>
<p><b>1. Water-conserving fixtures</b></p>
<p>I although I wasn&#8217;t aware of it at the time, my showerhead and bathroom faucet are designed to minimize water flow. The reduced flow doesn&#8217;t really affect the way the use them, because they have aerators that bolster the reduced flow with additional pressure. My old toilet, which I reused, has a 3-gallon tank. (Think of what a gallon of milk looks like. Isn&#8217;t that a lot of water?) Next time I&#8217;ll install a new toilet with a 1.6 gallon tank or with a dual-flush system that uses a full flush was only when needed.</p>
<p><b>2. Energy-saving appliances</b></p>
<p>The refrigerator, dishwasher and microwave I chose all have Energy Star ratings, which means that they meet or exceed that organization&#8217;s standards. Next time I&#8217;m shopping for appliances I&#8217;d like to compare ratings more closely and try to maximize savings.</p>
<p><b>3. Cabinetry without urea formaldehyde</b></p>
<p>Lots of the plywood and fiberboards used in cabinetry are built with glues that contain urea formaldehyde, a damaging VOC (volatile organic compound) that leaks into the air and into our lungs. When looking for kitchen cabinets next time, I&#8217;ll to find out whether they contain this compound and, if so, what the alternates are.</p>
<p><b>4. Salvaged pieces</b></p>
<p>I bought all of my products brand new. My kitchen is so small that I might have been able to find good wood cabinetry, a good sink, and stone countertops at a consignment shop. Using reclaimed products saves resources and diverts waste from landfills. <a href="https://www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Habitat for Humanity ReStore</a>, <a href="https://reclaimedhome.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reclaimed Home</a>, and <a href="https://unitedhousewrecking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United Home Wrecking</a> are all good places to hunt for spectacular finds.</p>
<p><b>5. Tiles manufactured locally or with recycled content</b></p>
<p>I chose tiles for the kitchen and bathroom without regard for where or how they were made. Next time I&#8217;ll try to source tiles that are manufactured locally, or that have some recycled content. Buying locally helps to prevent emissions from shipping. And many manufacturers that sell at large retailers, like <a href="https://americanolean.com/leed.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Olean</a>, are beginning to incorporate recycled materials into new product lines.</p>
<p><b>6. Low-VOC paint</b></p>
<p>Interior acrylic house paint contains VOC&#8217;s in acceptable, regulated quantities. But several popular companies are manufacturing lines of paint with specially reduced VOC content, like Benjamin Moore EcoSpec.</p>
<p><b>7. Efficient light fixtures</b></p>
<p>A big chunk of the electricity used in our country, about 20%, goes to interior lighting. When selecting undercabinet and ceiling light fixtures I was more concerned with the light quality than with the light source. But different bulbs use very different amounts of electricity. A simple way to save power and money is to choose lights with efficient halogens or LED bulbs, or to use fluorescent bulbs in incandescent fixtures.</p>

<p>This was what our entire house looked like when we purchased it. No, it was not finished to our standards but the bones of the house were perfect for us. It is about 2000 sq ft, three bedrooms, a large living room and kitchen, and windows on three side allowing for more light than a standard Brooklyn brownstone. The draw-back was that the last major remodel was done in 1910! That meant all new plumbing, electrical, heating and layout.</p>
<p>The layout included this &#8220;maid&#8217;s&#8221; room only accessible by stairs from the kitchen or through the bathroom. As much as I&#8217;d like a little help now and again I don&#8217;t have a cleaning person let alone a live in maid. The electrical and plumbing work had been redone by the previous owner using, what  I assume are all the skills  he learned from our local hardware store. The heating was done mostly by wood burning stove in the living room.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-676 mb-10" title="Maids Room Kitchen Wall After" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Maids-Room-Kitchen-Wall-After.jpg" alt="Maids Room Kitchen Wall After" width="540" height="360" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Maids-Room-Kitchen-Wall-After.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Maids-Room-Kitchen-Wall-After-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><span class="img-label">Maid&#8217;s Room 2009, same view as above.</span></p>
<p>The maid&#8217;s room, like the rest of the house, was reworked to keep the character of the house but make it livable for years to come. We closed up the stairs. Removed the back closet and wall. And punched new windows in the back wall to let more light in and a view of our back yard.  Check out the full set of photos of the process <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/swee10/sets/72157619203431217/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here. </a></p>
<p>After years of working in architecture offices on other peoples houses I thought this project would be easy and enjoyable. All told this room involved six subcontractors and it was neither easy nor enjoyable, but it should have been. For all my further projects I&#8217;m using  <a href="https://swee10.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swee10.com,</a> it&#8217;s everything I wish I&#8217;d had.</p>
