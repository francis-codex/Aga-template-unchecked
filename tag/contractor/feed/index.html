<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction? </b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was born in New York but moved to Los Angeles with my family when I was only six years old. I am proud to have built a design-build firm out here in Los Angeles that specializes in all different types of projects. From <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">residential remodeling</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete home renovations</a> to new construction, we are a one-stop source for quality design and construction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What do you love most about what you do?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My job has so many different facets to it, which makes it exciting. I enjoy creating, designing, and seeing a project come to fruition—seeing it take shape into a concrete design. I also love seeing my clients happy and really appreciating the new space we created together. It is rewarding to see the finished product and the joy that it brings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I want them to know that I truly have their best interest at heart. I want them to be completely satisfied with the project and I will do whatever it takes. It&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my top priority</a>. After all the time and energy that you put into a construction project, you shouldn&#8217;t just like it, you should love it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What’s the number one thing clients should know before starting a renovation? </b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Permits and plans are required for some jobs, which can cause delays. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s totally out of my hands. However, we will try to make up time while ensuring the project is on point.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite project that you’ve done?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My favorite project is a <span class="s2">house</span> that I just finished in Sherman Oaks. I was tasked with repurposing an outdated 1930s garage into an <span class="s2">ADU</span> (accessory dwelling unit). ADUs are popular in Los Angeles and the homeowners saw an <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opportunity to add more space</a> to their living area. They needed their <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old garage converted</a> into an office and guest suite. And they also hired us for <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their main house</a>. We made it an open concept layout and added a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary bathroom</a> and closet. The final outcome is beautiful but what really makes it my favorite project is how much the homeowners love it. They said they are in &#8220;pure bliss.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom Reber, the founder of <em>The Contractor Fight,</em> offers answers to common contractor issues and community support</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47552" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-2.jpg" alt="Tom Raber contractor fight" width="2000" height="1334" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-2.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When owning your own contracting business, day-to-day questions or larger issues will come up where answers are uncertain or the path forward isn’t clear. A contracting community as a sounding board can be helpful in your goal to keep your business moving and growing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this first of two blog posts, <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> talks with Tom Reber, founder of <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/"><span class="s2">The Contractor Fight</span></a>. Tom explains how to start job-costing, discussing profit and overhead with clients, and common issues that general contractors are facing within his coaching groups. You can also check out <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/category/the-contractor-fight-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his podcast</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten matches general contractors</a> </span><span class="s1">with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is the easiest way to start job-costing?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> A lot of general contractors overcomplicate this. It is as simple as doing the math on a regular basis. Ask yourself, “What am I spending per day to do this job?” “How many guys worked today, and what did I pay them?” “What did we spend at Home Depot?” Most people are just afraid to do the math, but if you do it daily or even weekly, it can be a lot less overwhelming.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How do you recommend GCs discuss profit and overhead with clients? </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> On occasion, a customer might ask, “How much profit do you make?” I typically respond with “That is a great question! We make X, which allows us to attract top talent, pay good salaries, benefits, and allows us to honor warranties.” Don’t skirt the question or get defensive—answering honestly and openly shows that you are transparent, run a tight shop, and have integrity.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s3">What are the most common issues facing GCs in your coaching groups? What do you recommend to address these issues? </span></h3>
<h4>Problem: Limited access to new ideas</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> Hands down, the number one issue is just looking at the symptom, like not making enough money or poor employee retention, and not figuring out the root cause. This problem is caused by how you think &#8211; they [contractors] get advice from their other unsuccessful contractor buddies, which continues to limit their thinking. </span></p>
<h4>Solution: Expand your network</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> You are the average of the five people you spend time with. Make sure you surround yourself with people who can help you, rather than hold you back. </span><span class="s1">By joining our group, you get access to different ways of thinking, including the Daily Challenge, which encourages you to test and learn. You will get comfortable with the uncomfortable—and <em>that</em> is when real change can happen.</span></p>
<h4>Problem: Not tackling the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right</span> issues</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> </span>The second biggest issue I see is a lack of clarity and consistency. As I mentioned in a previous answer, you need to get clarity on your biggest issues and then consistently attack it. You dug this hole over time, so don’t expect it to be solved overnight! You need to have grit and stick with those good daily habits that lead to progress.</p>
<h4>Solution: Focus on the numbers</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> </span>One of my favorite suggestions is to install KPI Fridays. This means dedicating some time at the end of the week to focus on your numbers, whether it be job costing or goal setting and tracking. It may seem remedial, but that is where most people need to start.</p>

<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4715#overview">View Michael&#8217;s profile and portfolio</a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></p>
<p>I was born and raised in <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bensonhurst, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooklyn. When I was around 17 or 18, I started working for a family friend in a cabinet factory. At the age of 22, I went out on my own—and I have never looked back!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What do you love most about your job?</strong></p>
<p>I love the challenge as well as seeing the final result.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the biggest challenge you face when renovating in New York?</strong></p>
<p>Pick your poison: parking, getting in or out, etc. Working in an urban area can be difficult.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</strong></p>
<p>Most times, homeowners aren&#8217;t realistic about the timeframe for the work needed. They should do their homework by <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-101/">researching materials, timelines,</a> and other things to expect when they are working with a general contractor on a renovation.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</strong></p>
<p>We stand behind our work; we are professionals. Also, t<span style="font-weight: 400;">hey can contact me 24-7; I always answer my phone.</span></p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite project you have done?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really enjoyed working with one of my clients on her home in Bed-Stuy. She was very helpful, rolled with the punches, and we communicated really well. The end result was a beautiful kitchen with a cool red Viking stove. </span></p>

<p><b>What is your favorite New York City restaurant?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avra Madison Estiatorio, 60th Street &amp; Madison Ave. </span></p>
<p><b>If you weren’t a general contractor, what would you be doing?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would be a real estate agent.</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite cocktail?</b></p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/search/dirty%20martini">Dirty martini</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction + architecture?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: I was born in Easton, Maryland. I grew up there and moved to Newark, Delaware when I was 10.  I’ve been in the field of architecture and design since 2004.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: Originally from Wilmington, Delaware. I have been involved in the construction industry in some form since 1986.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get into the industry?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: I started my career as an interior designer, but always worked for architects in a role that more closely resembled an interior architect rather than a designer or decorator. During the recession, I was lucky enough to retain my job but shifted studios within the large firm I was working for and made the decision to pursue my architectural license. Dave put up with me during a year of maniacal studying while working full time and taking those exams to get the license.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>:  I started life in finance. I worked for a large financial company for over 12 years. At the same time, I had a side life in construction. I soon learned that I enjoyed seeing things get built rather than just moving numbers around. I made a bold decision to change my life to do something that challenges me every day in a way that I can enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love most about what you do?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan and David</span>: Transforming old run-down spaces into beautiful places that people can enjoy with their families. We really enjoy going into different buildings throughout the city that we&#8217;ve never been in to get a different taste of the city.</p>
<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New York?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: Designing spaces that maximize the layout and function for our clients while still meeting the (sometimes seemingly ridiculous) NYC Building Code restrictions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: Constraints: limited timeframes, limited building hours, unhappy neighbors, logistics for material deliveries, logistics moving crew to projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32502 size-chrono" title="Renovation Checklist" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-723x143.jpg" alt="Renovation Checklist" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-723x143.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-600x119.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist.jpg 975w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>If clients have questions or concerns, how would you like them to address them?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan and David</span>: We highly value communication and feel it is the most important part of the process. We want clients to bring their questions or concerns to us as soon as possible so that we can address them as quickly as possible. We use web-based software to manage projects and clients can post their questions/comments with pictures and our team can address them, but email and phone calls also work. However, please don’t text us at 3:00am—we have lives and families too.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: We’re going to encounter hiccups. That’s nearly a given. You’re hiring our team to navigate those hiccups in the least painful way possible so that you can continue to enjoy your life while we deal with the challenges.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: As with many things in life, you often get what you pay for. We are not the least expensive option in the city, but if you want good quality work from a full-service team that will commit to your project and give you a great experience, we’re worth every penny.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City building? </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: Oddly and not for architectural reasons, the Time Warner Center at Columbus.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: Grand Central Station.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City neighborhood?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: The West Village.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: The Financial District.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City restaurant?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan and David</span>: El Centro–before having a family, we used to go twice a week. Amazing margaritas and no-frills Mexican!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Wallpaper, yes. Demo, definitely not.</h2>
<p>Let’s face it: there are just some projects you can do yourself and others that need a professional. At Sweeten, a free service that matches renovators with general contractors, we take a pretty hard stance on that fact. Numbers also show that homeowners often regret taking on DIY projects. According to a survey of 2,000 Americans conducted by the online referral source <a href="https://www.improvenet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.improvenet.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553691994801000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHDtpf0X-v09gkSqsml_4gCe56mpA"><i>Improve </i>Net</a>, 63 percent regretted at least one project. One in three respondents had to call a professional to redo their botched work, too.</p>
<p>We put together a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/diy-vs-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/diy-vs-contractor/">list of projects </a>that are totally okay to DIY, like wallpaper installation, and others we recommend hiring a contractor for (demolition, plumbing work—to name a few). To see real-life examples of those ideas, check out these Sweeten remodels below, where renovators completed a few small DIY projects themselves, plus DIY jobs that ultimately led to the homeowners hiring a contractor.</p>
<h3>DIY: Painting cabinets</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21436 size-full" title="black kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="black kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">As architects, Kate and Arthur know a thing or two about renovations. When they decided to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase and remodel their very own fixer-upper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they came to Sweeten to find a contractor to reconfigure the walls, expand the kitchen, and overhaul the bathroom. The couple also decided to take on a few small projects themselves, including building out the IKEA kitchen cabinets and painting the fronts (26 panels, some over 10 feet tall). They warned potential DIYers: only take on a do-it-yourself project like this “if you have the time, patience, and space.” While it was a money-saving exercise, it took a took almost a full month to paint the cabinets, plus they had to do the work in their own apartment.</span></p>
<h3>DIY: Installing wallpaper</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32900 size-full" title="wallpapered bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-10.jpg" alt="wallpapered bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flipping the floors of a Bedford-Stuyvesant brownstone to move the rental apartment to the garden-floor was no small project. Bellamy and Zak hired a Sweeten contractor to handle the majority of the work, from exposing the brick walls to tearing down walls. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was our first time doing a serious renovation that would require </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than our DIY skills could handle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Bellamy shared. They instead put those skills to use in the first-floor bathroom, installing a peel-and-stick dotted wallpaper and black wainscoting.</span></p>
<h3>DIY: Material sourcing</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38359 size-full" title="open living area and kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-16.jpg" alt="open living area and kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-16-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-16-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">To save on time and money, Barbra did all of her </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">own research on materials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from the kitchen appliances to the wallpaper. This was no small feat, as her family was planning a complete overhaul, including the kitchen and bathroom. “I never knew how many different types of doorknobs there were—or even realized I had strong preferences in doorknobs,” she said, “until I actually had to choose one.” That said, their contractor did give his input on where to splurge and save on materials, advising to invest in custom closets and tile, but to save on cabinetry instead of going custom.</span></p>
<h3>Hire a Contractor: for demolition, plumbing, and electrical work</h3>
<p>Just to reiterate: we do not recommend attempting any demolition, plumbing, or electrical work yourself. Rules and regulations aside, it&#8217;s also a matter of safety. Not to mention, demolition may look easy, but just think about getting all of the demolished drywall, cabinetry, and even appliances out yourself. In one Sweeten renovation, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-galley-kitchen-gets-in-line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-galley-kitchen-gets-in-line/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553780880310000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5pxgKk22rmE4VupJUutiwHeorPA">contractor had to saw through</a> the old stove and refrigerator to get them out of the kitchen! Stick with our suggestions for DIY projects and you&#8217;ll be on your way to a dream home you&#8217;ll love coming home to every day.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-ElizabethBorri-Kitch-Bath-Laundry06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31220 size-full" title="green-vanity-green-custom-shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-ElizabethBorri-Kitch-Bath-Laundry06.jpg" alt="green vanity and green custom shelves and cabinetry in a bathroom with green wall and stacked washer dryer after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-ElizabethBorri-Kitch-Bath-Laundry06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-ElizabethBorri-Kitch-Bath-Laundry06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-ElizabethBorri-Kitch-Bath-Laundry06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-ElizabethBorri-Kitch-Bath-Laundry06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-ElizabethBorri-Kitch-Bath-Laundry06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth wanted to update a half-bathroom into a bath-utility room combination. She </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/a-half-bath-remodel-in-financial-district-fixes-layout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">started the demolition herself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and then came to Sweeten to find a general contractor to complete the work when she realized figuring out how to fit everything she wanted in the room was going to be tricky. </span>Her contractor was able to find the best way to make use of the room and ended up finding extra space behind the wall that made a big difference, in addition to building custom shelves and cabinetry.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog04-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29589 size-full" title="kitchen " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog04-1.jpg" alt="kitchen " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog04-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog04-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog04-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">A series of DIY mishaps, shoddy professional work, and a leaky dishwasher (that ruined the floor) ultimately led Susan and Carl to post their kitchen renovation to Sweeten. Their Sweeten general contractor ended up completely </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-hodgepodge-of-diy-jobs-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demolishing their DIY’ed kitchen </span></a>and came up with a design plan to work around what the homeowners thought would be potential roadblocks. Whil<span style="font-weight: 400;">e the homeowners thought a beam would force them to shorten the cabinet height, their contractor “knew exactly how to notch out the back of the taller cabinets to accommodate the beam,” Susan said. </span></p>

<p><em>Welcome to #16 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p><em>Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a> with any reno questions or dilemmas you’d like addressed.</em></p>
</div>
<div><strong>QUESTION: What&#8217;s the biggest myth about general contractors?</strong></div>
<div><strong>JEAN: </strong>I love this question! One of the biggest myths about general contractors is that they want projects to go on for a long time. We&#8217;ve heard homeowners say things like, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s trying to stretch out the project. He wants it to, you know, go on forever.&#8221; The truth is, general contractors want exactly the opposite. Each day they have workers on your project is another day that they have to incur labor costs. Their ideal project is one that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starts and ends exactly on the schedule</a> they laid out so they can take that crew and move them to another project. General contractors do not want your project to go on indefinitely. They want it to be done as quickly as possible—just like you do—and they want to do it well.</div>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GC-Demo-Image-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38687 mb-0 size-chrono" title="diy vs contractor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GC-Demo-Image-1-723x482.jpg" alt="construction, diy vs contractor" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GC-Demo-Image-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GC-Demo-Image-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GC-Demo-Image-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GC-Demo-Image-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GC-Demo-Image-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>Whether for budgetary reasons or because you’d like to contribute some sweat equity to your new home, you might be tempted to take on a portion of the renovation yourself. Depending on how you rank on the handiness scale, you may be able to contribute, and you should first discuss with your general contractor what is safe for you to do. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten,</a> a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, surveyed some of its GCs to get their take on the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts of homeowner helpfulness.</p>
<h2><b>What to DIY</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sourcing materials</li>
<li>Painting</li>
<li>Updating hardware (ie. knobs, pulls)</li>
<li>Assembling modular cabinetry or closet systems</li>
<li>Hanging small fixtures (ie. towel racks, swapping out a light fixture)</li>
<li>Installing wallpaper</li>
</ul>
<h3>DO: Source materials</h3>
<p>One of the initial tasks of a renovation is to source materials. “If you&#8217;re excited about the renovation and want to participate, a major task you can help with is to select materials, fixtures, and finishes as soon as possible,&#8221; says Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill. &#8220;Collaborate with your contractor to confirm the materials you need, including the measurements and the sequence in which they should be ordered and delivered. Getting this completed is a bigger deal than it sounds, and paves the way for a successful renovation.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Walter</a> tells us that he often works with clients who like to find their own materials. “This saves time if the client already knows what they want, he says. &#8220;They can make the list and I will look it over.” In some scenarios, the clients are working with a designer, who also helps with the sourcing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43085 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sweeten-Slider_Designers.gif" alt="DIY vs professional" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />(<em>Above</em>) <em>These Sweeten homeowners DIY&#8217;d some parts of their reno, but left parts that required licenses, trade skills, and safety to the professionals. </em><em>Check out what <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arthur</a>, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-rental-in-a-brownstone-gets-fashionable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bellamy</a>, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-hodgepodge-of-diy-jobs-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Susan</a>, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barbra</a> did to their homes.</em></p>
<h3>DO: Easy refreshes</h3>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Matt</a> explains that good DIY projects should be inexpensive upgrades and only “require minimal tools.&#8221; “Some simple DIY projects that homeowners can do is to freshen up the room with a coat of paint, update kitchen/bathroom hardware, install wallpaper, or spruce up the front entry with greenery,” he says.</p>
<h3>DO: Paint</h3>
<p>Generally, DIY painting is a great cost-saving measure because of the large disparity between the cost of professional painting and a DIY job. This is because painting is mainly about labor—and it does require skill if your walls need a lot of prep work. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Phil</a> says that this job is a good candidate for a DIY because it’s “confined, not noisy, and relatively easy. Prep work is the hard part, so a homeowner could outsource that part and just do the painting.” Importantly, “it’s at the end of the project, you don’t hold anything up.”</p>
<h3>DO: Work that requires minimal tools</h3>
<p>If you’re a patient person with attention to detail, you can also assemble your own modular kitchen cabinets and closet systems, while outsourcing the installation to a general contractor. Many modular projects, such as those from IKEA, are geared toward homeowner assembly, so they require minimal skills and tools.  You can now find wallpaper that is installation-friendly. In general, though, you may need a second set of hands to help with this detailed-oriented task.</p>
<h2><b>What to Leave for the Pros</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Demolition</li>
<li>Plumbing or electrical work</li>
<li>Any kind of structural work</li>
<li>Skim coating</li>
<li>Tilework</li>
<li>Flooring</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, it may not be advisable for a homeowner to take on renovation projects, even if they feel capable. In many urban apartment buildings, for example, you are governed by co-op, condo, and city regulations that require a professional to undertake any contracting work. Your building will require your contractor to provide a license and insurance information to hold the firm accountable for the work being done in your home. If you do the work yourself, you could get yourself and your general contractor into trouble.</p>

<h3>DON’T: Take on demolition, plumbing, or electrical</h3>
<p>Rules and regulations aside, there is also the matter of safety. Sweeten general contractor Phil told us that he’s had clients ask to do their own demolition in the past. “It may seem easy, but actually, there’s a lot to consider,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You create a lot of garbage; how do you get it out? What if you damage something that you have to preserve? What if you get hurt in the process?” These considerations also guide our recommendation that anything structural, or involving plumbing or electricity, is best left to the professionals.</p>
<h3>DON&#8217;T: Consider skim coating</h3>
<p>Skim coating is a process that hand-applies a layer of mud used in construction over the surface of your walls and ceilings and is then smoothed by hand. General contractor Walter strongly advises against a homeowner from taking on this task. &#8220;Spackling takes a lot of skill and practice that should be left to a professional,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If done incorrectly it would ruin the finished product of the job.&#8221; Jean talks about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating here</a>.</p>
<h3>DON’T: Install flooring or tiles</h3>
<p>Flooring and tile work are other areas that homeowners often consider DIYing. Depending on the level of difficulty and your own experience with this type of work, you may attempt to take it on. But if you’ve never done it before, you may not be able to execute it properly. Any mistakes will have to be fixed by the contractor, which delays the project and costs everyone time and your money.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/clean-up-after-major-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43105 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1.jpg" alt="clean up after renovation" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>DON’T: Take on projects that may cause delay</h3>
<p>The final consideration that Sweeten contractors point out is timing. If a DIY project is something that must happen in the middle of the project and be finished before the rest of the work can continue, homeowners must complete the DIY project when they say they will. Otherwise, the entire project falls behind.</p>
<p>General contractors are responsible for scheduling their workers, as well as any subcontractors for electrical or plumbing work, to make sure everyone’s job is completed in a timely fashion. If you, as the homeowner, have not finished assembling the kitchen cabinets, they can’t be mounted, the countertops cannot go in, the backsplash cannot be installed. (You get the picture.) These delays can be very costly. For this reason, the best DIY projects tend to be those that happen at the end of a renovation (like painting!).</p>
<p>With these do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts in mind, go ahead and take on the tasks that give the professionals the space they need to keep your renovation moving along on schedule. You’ll soon be enjoying your new space with a touch of your own handiwork.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Fix water damage and give the main-floor bathroom a facelift in Valley Stream, Long Island</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The problem with the first-floor bathroom in Marilyn’s 1950s home was twofold. While undergoing a separate renovation in the basement, the family discovered water damage in the bathroom that needed to be fixed ASAP. The subfloor was rotting out from what they assumed was pre-existing damage prior to their ownership of the home, plus a slow leak. Marilyn, a veteran renovator and construction manager, also wanted to give the bathroom a cosmetic facelift to make it more cohesive with the rest of her house. “I felt like my house was really modern (and totally my taste), and that bathroom was an eyesore,” Marilyn said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="beige-bathroom-with-pedestal-sink"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48884 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="Beige bathroom with pedestal sink and bathtub before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Eager to complete the renovation in time for Christmas dinner when plenty of guests would be in her home, Marilyn posted her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25914" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project on Sweeten</a> and was matched with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a> early in December. They tackled the water damage first by reinforcing joists and demoing the rest of the space, removing the bathtub, toilet, vanity, and old tile flooring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She had initially debated replacing the bathtub with a rain <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/luxury-shower-systems-steaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shower</a>, but it was the only bathtub in the house (and one her kids loved to use). Instead, she set out to find a deep tub that would add to the luxury feel of the space. “I actually had to get this special ordered, because it&#8217;s really, really deep and wide,” Marilyn said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marilyn spent an entire day at the tile store, searching for the perfect ones for the wall, floor, and shower. “I fell in love with the white subway tile, but I went with a gray grout,” she said. Along the shower and bath wall, she opted for a gray gradient tile, and then a pop of color in the storage niche with a turquoise that ties in with the wall color. The modern <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> boasts lots of storage for the smaller space, thanks to the large drawers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given her expertise and knowledge of the industry, Marilyn was very hands-on throughout the renovation and worked directly with her Sweeten contractor on finding, picking, and negotiating prices on materials. One of the biggest and only challenges they ran into was accommodating the oversized bathtub. “It’s almost like jutting out past the wall a little bit, but he was able to get a nice little silver trim just so everything looks kind of consistent. We had to shimmy things to make it straight,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marilyn-Ordonez-Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-35620 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="white-subway-tiles-on-half-wall"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48878 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="White subway tiles on half wall with glossy brown vanity and white sink and brown wooden floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="brown-vanity-with-long-cabinet-pulls"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48882 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="Brown vanity with long cabinet pulls in a white and blue bathroom with dark floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The results were totally worth it and the project was completed just in time. “I absolutely love it. I get lots and lots of compliments from everyone who comes to my home, and it&#8217;s always really nice,” Marilyn said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Marilyn’s daughters are in love with the giant new bathtub. She said, “Both of my girls get in this big tub, and it&#8217;s like a little swimming pool for them!” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Bathtub, 21&#8243; deep: <a href="https://maax.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maax.</a> Hague 3-light vanity light, Maxted modern wall shelf, robe hook, toilet ring, and Kohler medicine cabinet, K-2967-BR1: <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">For a business owner, once a business plan and financing are ready, and a space for your office, <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/cost-breakdown-restaurant-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restaurant</a>, or retail space has been identified, the next crucial step is understanding the commercial lease itself. Having the right team—a commercial real estate broker and an attorney—who specializes in negotiating leases for commercial spaces will help advise what should be included in the lease document to protect you and your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractors, consulted the experts to define these elements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, a landlord provides the first version of the lease, which will (obviously) favor the landlord and is often derived from a template. Oftentimes, the landlord will use a template. Commercial real estate broker with Compass, Alex Cohen, explains, “The commercial real estate advisor negotiates all the key business terms on behalf of a tenant before a lease is prepared or an attorney is engaged by the tenant. Once a lease is drawn, the advisor can confirm all of the agreed business terms are accurately conveyed in the lease and can assist the attorney in the negotiation of legal terms.” While the lease should include everything previously discussed in the term sheet, your attorney should perform a close review, checking that you are clear on the terms and making any necessary adjustments so that the lease is more favorable to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Something to keep in mind: There are important differences between residential and commercial agreements. If you are familiar with residential leasing, you may make (incorrect) assumptions about commercial leases based on that experience. One major difference is that residential renters have rights under the law—to heating and repairs, for example. In a commercial tenancy situation, the landlord does not have to provide heat or make repairs unless it is stipulated in the lease. Read on for the specifics of what is typically included in a commercial lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Base rent, steps, and escalations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rental amount on a commercial lease is calculated via several variables. You are responsible for a base rent, which is the minimum amount of rent you pay. This is often calculated on a yearly basis and based on the rent per rentable square foot, a term explained below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For office tenants in New York, the square footage for which a business pays rent can be 30% to 40% greater than the square footage on which carpet can be laid and furniture installed. Rentable square feet for <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/office-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">office space</a> is usable area, plus a portion of the common areas adjusted by a market loss factor. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-guide-retail-renovation-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retail space</a>, however, is generally marketed and leased on a usable square foot (the actual square footage of space that is available to the tenant for its business use) basis. Loss factors are higher for partial-floor office spaces than for full-floor occupancies, because common areas like corridors, elevators, and lobbies are apportioned on divided floors into each tenant’s square footages. This means full floors are usually more efficient and cost-effective than partial-floor occupancies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to fixed increases in the base rent—typically every five years and referred to as &#8220;rent steps&#8221;— various mechanisms (“escalations”) exist that adjust the rent to be paid by the tenant during the term of the lease. Landlords want to ensure that they will continue to generate profit and will want the tenant to bear at least part of the responsibility for increased operating costs and higher taxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Additional rent for utility charges and services</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In New York City, base rent does not usually include electricity service. Utilities are usually charged by submetering, or through rent inclusion (though if you are fortunate, your space will have a separate meter and you pay the actual cost of electric usage directly to Con Edison). If your commercial space is not individually metered, you will have to buy electricity from the landlord, who usually marks it up. In submetering, you will pay a monthly electric charge (plus markup) to your landlord. With rent inclusion, the landlord includes a fixed charge for electricity lumped onto the rent, calculated per rentable square foot. This is a prime area for negotiation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other utilities such as water, gas, and heat, may be included in the rent or sub-metered. Typically this is decided based on building configuration and usage—if it is low, the landlord is usually happy to include it in the rent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also note that if the utilities are shared in the building, the landlord is only responsible for providing the utilities in the hours stated in the lease. For example, if you need to use the heat after hours, you may have to negotiate that separately and pay additional after-hours charges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another area of consideration is cleaning services for your rented space. There are typically three options: 1) landlord includes the service as part of the rent; 2) landlord has a preferred vendor who you pay out-of-pocket; or 3) you obtain cleaning services on your own (or clean the space yourself!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Terms of the lease</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In commercial real estate, a “short-term” lease is considered anything under five years, whereas a “long-term lease” is anything longer than five years and often for a 10-plus year period. You will decide what kind of lease works for your business based on how stable it is, and how long you think the location will work for your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In tandem with the length of the lease, also pay close attention to the assignment and subletting rights. If you need the flexibility to assign or sublet your space, in case you need to move your business or unexpectedly close it, then you want to make sure the process is not unnecessarily onerous. Every lease requires the landlord&#8217;s consent to sublease unless you are renting desk space to another firm and this is permitted in the lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lease concessions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is common for leases to include a rent-free period and a tenant improvement allowance (TIA) for use during the contractor build-out of the interior, particularly if the landlord is providing a raw space. Alternatively, the landlord might choose to renovate on behalf of a tenant, subject to their requirements; rent typically commences when the tenant assumes occupancy of the finished space. During times when the market favors tenants, landlords are often willing to provide funding for the build-out. The dollar amount is usually calculated based on the rentable square footage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the time, landlords are more willing to grant concessions when it is a long-term lease, because they are guaranteed income for a longer length of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with base rents, the market generally dictates lease concessions. But depending on the condition of the space and a tenant’s requirements and credit, these concessions can differ significantly on properties that have similar base rents. It’s important that your real estate broker understands your preferences so that many of these issues can be discussed upfront at or prior to the term-sheet stage and finalized by your attorney in the lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Renewal options</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are no automatic lease renewals in commercial real estate. Once your lease expires, there are also no caps on what the landlord can ask for the new rent. Of course, market conditions will influence how strong a position you are in to negotiate. One way to pre-empt this issue is to negotiate for an “option to renew” in your initial lease. Discuss and decide whether this will be a fixed increase or a “fair-market” rent increase, which is calculated by looking at comparable properties and transactions in the neighborhood and may be subject to arbitration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Permitted use</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make sure that your intended use of the property is permitted by the Certificate of Occupancy (issued by the Department of Buildings) as well as by zoning regulations. The lease needs to state clearly what the permitted uses are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security deposit and guarantees</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Landlords want a reliable tenant. They attempt to ensure this in a number of ways, including via security deposits and guarantees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are deemed somewhat risky, this will be reflected in the amount of security deposit the landlord will require upfront. Security deposits in many cases must be in the form of a letter of credit from your bank, and typically the first month’s rent is due at lease execution, even if there is a free rent period at the beginning of the lease. A corporate guarantee from a parent company that owns the corporate entity signing the lease and/or a “good guy” guaranty provided by a principal of the firm may also be required.</p>

<p><strong>What do you love most about construction?</strong></p>
<p>I love that I can transform a space and make it into what the client wants as well as my vision. The gratifying part is the thanks I receive for my work and the fact that I actually made a difference in someone’s life.</p>
<p><strong>If you couldn’t be a general contractor what would you be doing?</strong></p>
<p>I’d be painting.</p>
<p><strong>What are some myths or misconceptions about contractors that you want to set straight?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a misconception that all contractors are cheats and liars. It is a very challenging job, but I do think that contractors who are professional provide an incredible service to the community and I do think that we change lives for the better.</p>

<p><strong>Describe your ideal client.</strong></p>
<p>Someone who is open, knowledgeable, and has a good design sensibility.</p>
<p><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</strong></p>
<p>They should know that I am giving them my &#8220;all,&#8221; I am giving them 100%, and that their interest is my interest. I want to do the best job possible.</p>
<p><strong>If clients have concerns or issues with the project, how would you like them to handle it?</strong></p>
<p>We have an open door policy. If you have an issue with something, call us, talk to us—we are very responsive.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite renovation that you&#8217;ve done?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of my most recent renovations was renovating an 1839 brownstone in Brooklyn for a young couple. The experience was really awesome because they were very much involved and at the same time they totally respected and loved my crew and fed them almost every day. It just made the whole process incredibly joyful and pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>How do you like your coffee?</strong></p>
<p>Strong and…strong.</p>
<p><strong>Bagel or donut?</strong></p>
<p>Bagel.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite cuisine?</strong></p>
<p>I love Japanese cuisine, I do.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite New York restaurant?</strong></p>
<p>Nobu is one of my favorite New York restaurants.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite borough?</strong></p>
<p>Brooklyn is my favorite.</p>

Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new queries, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Feel free to email me at <strong><a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a></strong> with any reno questions or dilemmas you&#8217;d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What&#8217;s an important quality to remember when hiring a general contractor?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN:</strong> After a homeowner posts his or her project with Sweeten and has reviewed general contractor matches, the next focus should be communication style. Simply put, you want to find a contractor with whom you can communicate well and who has a similar style to yours. Are you the type of person who wants phone calls, text messages, or only emails? Is having everything documented, including receiving a daily update, more comfortable for you, or are you more laid back? Do you tend to be upfront and direct or less so? Whatever is your preference, be sure those points of communication are aligned between you and the contractor you choose.</p>

<h3>Moving forward with top contractor choices</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Sweeten, we know a lot about general contractors. One frequent question from homeowners involves how to prepare for a general contractor meeting. Site visits assess if a pro will be a good fit and to also secure the most precise estimate possible for the project.</p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">We recommend:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">reviewing three expert profiles that Sweeten matches you with</span></li>
<li class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">having at least three phone calls and site visits with the matches</span></li>
<li class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">requesting three estimates so you can make an informed decision</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">A phone call to discuss the project before the site visit may save you valuable time. It&#8217;s a good first introduction and gauges whether you&#8217;re both on the same page.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—</span>for free.</p>
<h4>Why it&#8217;s important to meet general contractors on-site</h4>
<p>Site visits are one of the first steps in a renovation. The meeting lasts 60–90 minutes on average and gives you a chance to interview experts who will help you get the job done. More importantly, it checks whether there&#8217;s chemistry and good communication between you and the contractor.</p>
<p>While Sweeten simplifies the search by matching vetted and licensed professionals to your project, you&#8217;ll still want to make an informed decision by having an in-person meeting. The visits should be with one contractor at a time. As you begin to schedule visits and solicit bids, here are a few ways you can prepare for a successful meeting with potential general contractors.

<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Preparing the details for a remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">To prepare for your site visit, keep the following on hand for easy reference: </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Anticipated start date</span></span></strong><span class="s1"><strong>:</strong> Include information about any flexibility, as well as variables that might affect/change the date.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Renovation goals</span></span></strong><span class="s1"><strong>:</strong> Be prepared to discuss your <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;must-haves&#8221; and &#8220;nice-to-haves&#8221;</a> items. You may request that bids include ways to remove items from the latter category if the budget is going over. Be specific about how you plan to use the new space, and how the old space falls short. If you need more storage, be specific about what you want to store there. Sharing this information with your contractor will help them create tailored solutions for you. If you are unsure of your end goals, let the contractor know. This will establish that you are looking for guidance, and the contractor can advise accordingly or suggest a designer or other expert to work in tandem with you.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Budget</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: Reiterate your budget so that the contractor can keep it in mind while discussing options. For example, this will affect whether they suggest custom or stock cabinets. You can also specify a labor versus material budget. If you plan to apply for a loan to finance your project, mention this upfront since it’ll add time to your project. At the end of your meeting, ask when you can expect an estimate.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Inspiration photos</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: One of the best ways for a contractor to get a sense of your vision is to provide a Pinterest page, photos on your phone, or magazine tearsheets.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Plans and sketches</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: If you have these, provide them. Even if it’s a rough sketch you did by hand on scrap paper, it can help the contractor understand your vision. If you did them in SketchUp or had an architect draw renderings already, have them ready.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Division of labor</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: Who will do what? If you plan to source the materials yourself, make that clear so that the expert does not include those estimates in the bid. Should you need a designer, an expediter, a project manager, or custom millwork, discuss who will be responsible for securing those services and whether they will be included. If you don’t yet know, make a point to discuss these options with the contractor.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>House rules and alteration agreement</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: If you live in a condo or a co-op building, ask your management company for these documents. Review them with or prior to meeting the contractor. Restrictions on working hours and building requirements can often affect the budget. Some co-op boards will not work with specific insurance carriers so <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check with your board</a>. Share this with the contractor prior to the site visit. You want to be sure that your top contractor choices can work in your building. </span></p>
<h3>How to prepare for a general contractor meeting</h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Questions for a general contractor</span></h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Keep in mind that many factors go into a smooth working relationship. Understanding as much as you can about the contractor’s experience, and how they work, is crucial. Try to have</span><span class="s1"> all decision makers present during the site visit. This will ensure that everyone is on the same page. </span><span class="s1">The following are examples of questions to ask: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">How often will they be on-site? </span><span class="s2">Who will oversee the work on a daily basis?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does the contractor take clients shopping for materials or provide shopping resources?<br />
</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">How often do they meet with clients to discuss the project&#8217;s progress?<br />
</span></li>
<li>Will the contractor send progress reports via email or by phone, and how often? If you have a preference, let them know this.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">How do they approach problems during an emergency? If a pipe should burst, what is the protocol?<br />
</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">What is the best way to reach them?<br />
</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ask for an estimate. The length of time to receive it depends on the size of the scope. Ask them what the ETA is for the estimate. An estimate for a one-room project that&#8217;s straightforward should take one week, while a gut renovation of a townhouse may take a month.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ask for references or read contractors&#8217; reviews on our site. For bigger projects, a contractor may take you on a walk-through of a project they completed for a past client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other topics to bring up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss with the contractor if you and your family plan on living/working in the space during the renovation. What will this arrangement look like?</li>
<li>Share any important dates that affect the completion date, such as family coming to visit. Will the project be completed by then? If not, what is the plan?</li>
<li>Inquire how the contractor&#8217;s company is set up. Do they have more than one project happening at once?</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Communication is key</span></h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Like all great matches, there is a lot that can’t be determined on paper. Face-to-face meetings are not only an opportunity for the contractors to get a sense of the scope of your project and the actual site conditions but also for you to get to know them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two of you will be working closely together for the duration of the project. It’s important that you feel the contractor understands where you are coming from and the vision you want to execute. Having a contractor who&#8217;s had similar experiences in handling the scope you are presenting is more important than whether they&#8217;ve done work in your neighborhood. How to prepare for a general contractor meeting also includes listening to your “gut feeling.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your site visit is a chance to interview an individual who will become a key part of your life for the next few weeks to months. You will rely on them to make decisions when you’re not available, but also to know when a discussion is necessary before taking action. So consider these questions as you’re getting to know the contractor during the site visit:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does this person communicate clearly and effectively?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Do they have a clear understanding of what I need, and can they provide it?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Do I feel supported in my decision-making?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does it seem like the contractor will be responsive and organized throughout the process?</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Schedule a bid-leveling call</span></h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">After the walk-through, take the time to sit down and debrief. If you go over the full scope of the work and ask for the contractor&#8217;s feedback on your ideas, this will create a firm foundation for working together.</span></p>
<p>When all estimates are in hand, schedule a one-on-one <a href="https://sweeten.com/bid-leveling-call-for-renovation-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid leveling call</a> with Sweeten to help compare them. Estimates are not universal and can differ in terminology, organization, and basic assumptions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b></b>Here’s how to keep key materials—from countertops to appliances—performing at tip top</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">As your <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/">home renovation</a> draws to a close, you may experience feelings of relief and joy at the transformation from the old to the new. Decisions on materials turned out to be good choices, and daily life is now blending and flowing around your new space. Aftercare may be the last thing on your mind, or you may find yourself wondering: &#8220;How do I keep my newly renovated space looking great for years to come?&#8221;. Here are five ways to care for your new home.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="Range with white tile backsplash and open shelving" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56349" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Consult manufacturers’ manuals for appliance care</strong></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">An obvious first renovation aftercare step that many homeowners skip. Most appliance manufacturers have a place on their webpage dedicated to manuals or product service and support. A model number will lead you to literature on cleaning and maintenance. Often, a simple Google search is enough. For example, a stainless wine refrigerator requires little attention except for periodically washing off fingerprints. This can be done with water and mild dish soap, then polished with a microfiber cloth dipped in mineral, cooking or olive oil. Note: Clean and polish with the grain. Look closely! Steel has grain just like wood. Here are extra tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://amzn.to/44JR5ag">Weiman Stainless Steel Wipes or Liquid Spray</a> work great</li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Register major appliances with the manufacturer through their website.</li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Make sure you know the model numbers for future reference &#8212; often they are on the back of the machine so take a picture or write it down for future reference.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speak with your contractor about how to maintain your equipment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Candid shot of Lia in her kitchen renovated with Sweeten" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56288" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Safeguard your kitchen countertops</strong></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">You probably reviewed pros and cons of different materials before you made your final decision of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/popular-types-of-kitchen-countertops/">kitchen countertops</a>. Ready to start cooking? Here’s a refresh!</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><strong>Quartz countertops</strong>, such as <a href="https://www.caesarstoneus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caesarstone</a>, are durable, non-porous and do not need to be annually resealed, but acidic foods or juices can erode the acrylic. This material is also more likely to be damaged by excessive heat than granite, crushed glass or concrete. Treat yourself to trivets.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Porous natural stones</strong>, such as granite and marble, may need to be resealed periodically and are susceptible to stains from oils and acids. Don’t let spilled liquids sit on your stone countertops. Spill? Swipe! Accidents happen &#8212; <a href="https://amzn.to/44LtExe">this etch remover</a> can be a lifesaver</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Laminate or solid-surfacing countertops</strong>, in this case, renovation aftercare means cutting boards are mandatory because both of these materials are easily scratched.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09.webp" alt="Shower with green and white patterned tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57255" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Tend to your tiles</strong></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-popular-bath-tiles-and-how-much-they-cost/">Bathroom tiles</a> get hazy with soapy residue, while kitchen backsplashes get splattered with oil, and floor tiles experience both! Regular cleaning will prevent the need to muscle through buildup, so break out a mild all-purpose cleaner and some basic cleaning equipment.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">For kitchen backsplash tiles, mix dish liquid with water and rub away the oily residue with a sponge or gentle cloth. White vinegar mixed with warm water is another option. A mild all-purpose cleaner will clean up bath tiles nicely. Mix the solution with water and wipe with a rag, a soft brush or sponge.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Sweep or vacuum floor tiles of any debris and grit on a regular basis to avoid dulling or scratching the surface. After clearing away large particles, use a mop and bucket with mild soap or detergent and warm water. If you wind up with a hazy film, consider switching up your mop material (sponge to chamois, for example) and/or wipe away the film with a fresh cloth and an all-purpose cleaner.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Seal your grout! Where there is tile, there is grout. <a href="https://amzn.to/3EusDPF">Use a sealant like this one</a>. For renovation aftercare for your grout, use gentle brushes to scrub it clean. And if your regular tile cleaning routine is not doing the trick on your grout, try a paste of baking soda and water, a mild bleach solution or store-bought grout cleaner.

<h3><strong>4. Work with your wood</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Refinished or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brand new hardwoods</a> can be beautiful foundations for your home. If you are the type of family that takes off your shoes before entering the home, you are off to a great start! Even if not, caring for your floors can be easy with a few simple guidelines.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Begin your flooring renovation aftercare by placing indoor and outdoor welcome mats. Mats placed before and after the threshold of your door are an important first step in maintaining scratch- and stain-free floors even in the winter.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Area rugs cut down on regular wear and tear on the floors in the areas where they are positioned.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Little felt stickers (<a href="https://amzn.to/3Z7SqXp">like these</a>) do a good job protecting your floors from furniture-driven scratches.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are a few rules of thumb when cleaning your floors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sweep or vacuum debris on a regular basis</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Mop with water and a gentle soap and never leave water or other liquids sitting on your hardwoods. Water can eventually penetrate the finish and leave stains in the wood. If you are not sure what cleaner to use on your floors, manufacturers of wood sealants often offer hardwood floor cleaners, such as <a href="https://amzn.to/3RcK4vs">Minwax® Hardwood Floor Cleaner</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Laura-pantry-09-scaled.gif" alt="Moving image off renovator in custom cabinets" width="1706" height="2560" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57343" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Care for your cabinets</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although you likely will not be cleaning your kitchen or bathroom cabinets as often as higher-traffic surfaces (such as shower tiles and cooking countertops), don’t forget about them!  </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Knobs and pulls can harbor germs and cabinet doors can become grimy over time from moisture and oils in the air. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Similarly to hardwood floors, wooden cabinets don’t do well with water or other liquids resting on their surface.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1">Whether you clean your cabinets with soapy water, white vinegar water or mild all-purpose cleaner, remember these vital last steps: wipe away cleaner residue with a wet cloth and dry your cabinets with a towel.</span></p>
<p>—</p>
<p class="p1">Making sure that the materials you choose for your home match your lifestyle will make it much easier to care for them.

Nikki and Chris&#8217; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen renovation</a> in Astoria, Queens</p>
<p>If you’ve ever had all four burners on and the oven cranking in a kitchen with average airflow, you know why ventilation is important. There’s the immediate issue of smoke, grease, and heat that can prompt your dinner guests to poke their heads out of the nearest open window and your smoke detector to pierce your eardrums. And then there’s the following day hangover, meaning the stale smell of last night’s meal camping out in every corner of your home.</p>
<p>Thoughtful ventilation in a kitchen can reduce, if not eliminate, this altogether. And the good news is it can be an easy addition to your renovation project.</p>
<p>It’s best to conceive your ventilation plan in the design phase of your kitchen renovation, because each decision will have an impact on other elements of your kitchen. Your choice of range will dictate the exhaust hood you will need to suck up grease and odor. Your hood might determine whether or not you can skip the ducting to funnel air outside.</p>
<h3><strong>Popular types of kitchen ventilation </strong></h3>
<p>Here are four types of kitchen ventilation ranging from the least involved, in terms of your renovation build out, to the most involved (and also the most effective):</p>
<h4><strong>Downdraft Kitchen Ventilation</strong></h4>
<p>If an exhaust hood doesn&#8217;t fit in your kitchen design, then there&#8217;s downdraft ventilation, which is a built-in feature of some ranges. They can either be stationary behind the range or pop up when you are cooking. This system pulls air horizontally into its filtering system. The air either goes back into the kitchen or, if there is ducting, taken outside of the home. If no ducting is involved, then downdraft ventilation is an option for apartments and townhouses where air cannot be directed outside.</p>
<h4><strong>Ductless Exhaust Hood Ventilation </strong></h4>
<p>The restraints of your home and your budget, as well as your choice of cooking range, are the biggest factors dictating your ventilation. A hood with no ducting or piping to the outside will filter out some of the grease and odor in the air, but ultimately that air will be recirculated into the room, explained Jace Kieffer from <a href="https://www.kieffers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kieffer’s Appliances</a>, a leading showroom based in Philadelphia. If you’re doing a lot of cooking, cracking a window might seem basic, but it will help, he said.</p>
<p>Apartment and townhouse owners may not have the option of funneling cooking odors outside. If that is the case, then downgrading the size of your range to limit smoke and odor might be a wise idea.</p>
<p>The cost of a hood with no additional ventilation is a few hundred dollars from a big-box store like Home Depot. Although construction costs, especially labor, can differ across the country, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Jon</a> estimated installation of a ductless hood to cost $150. For New York City, installing a smaller hood against a wall starts at $250, said Scott Kopin from design showroom <a href="https://www.pirch.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pirch</a>. Larger hoods and those installed over kitchen islands are more complex adding to the installation costs. You’re looking at a starting price of about $500 for this, Kopin said.</p>
<h4><strong>Ducted Exhaust Hood Ventilation</strong></h4>
<p>A hood with piping that takes cooking air and odor outside will be sufficient for most families who like to cook, according to Sweeten contractor Jon. For big meals, it might be worth opening a window so the old air is pushed out as fresh air comes in. On top of buying a hood (that can go from a few hundred dollars to several thousand for a custom job), the cost of installing ducting and cutting an exit into the wall of your kitchen is “not as bad as you might think,” said Jon. To cut through vinyl or wood siding (something like stone is more difficult and expensive) and install about 10 feet of piping is about $400 to $800, according to Jeffrey Payne, sales associate from Atlanta-based appliance showroom <a href="https://www.howardpayne.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howard Payne Company</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Kitchen Ventilation System: Makeup Air</strong></h4>
<p>Unlike a typical HVAC system, makeup air is an open system that brings fresh air in as stale air is pushed out. It is activated only when needed, like when you switch your hood fan on.</p>
<p>A makeup air system could also be required. Since 2009, the International Residential Code, the code followed by most US states, requires a makeup air system for any hood that is 400 CFM or greater (Cubic Feet per Minute is a measure of air volume). Building inspectors previously took a relaxed approach to this clause; that has changed since houses became more airtight, according to Jace. It is becoming more common for the 400 CFM rule to be enforced. If your home, such as an apartment or townhouse, doesn’t allow for outside ventilation, including a makeup air system, then your hood may need to register less than 400 CFM.</p>
<p>With the makeup air system, not only do you get a fresh air, you can also get fresh air that matches the internal temperature of your home. That’s because the incoming air is warmed or cooled in the HVAC system before it is circulated in your home.</p>
<p>Makeup air is the most sophisticated&#8211;and also the most expensive. The piece that controls the inflow of air is a few hundred dollars, said Sweeten contractor Jon. Installing it, running the piping and cutting a hole in the siding for the air to exit starts at about $1,000.</p>
<p>Kitchen Ventilation</p>
<p>Like anything in home renovations, there are many variables&#8211;budget, layout, your priorities, etc.&#8211;that will determine your end result. Whatever your ventilation desires, make sure you decide what you want early in your renovation to avoid some later headaches.</p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Carroll Gardens homeowner Kim Solop </span></i></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After ten years of living in our Carroll Gardens condo, we really needed a change. We contemplated a move to the suburbs or upgrading to a bigger place in a less popular Brooklyn neighborhood. After almost a year of looking and being priced out in our current neighborhood, we decided to renovate our current place, a two-bed, two-bath, 1,200 square-foot condo that we bought in 2006. We loved our current neighborhood with its proximity to our workplaces, lots of cute restaurants, shops, and our two sons’ schools. The problems were in the apartment itself: I was unhappy with the dark kitchen—I always had been. I love taking baths but hated the jet tub that was installed over a decade ago. Lastly, our laundry closet had a lot of wasted space and I wanted to add a walk-in pantry!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a big fan of home decor blogs, I had been stalking the Sweeten site for a while, and really loved seeing the transformations that the contractors could do with space. I was excited for the chance to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/15462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our renovation</a>. I met with a couple of them, and decided on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>. I really clicked with the project managers and could see that we would have a good partnership.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My main objective for the kitchen was to brighten it up and eliminate the space between the cabinets and the ceiling. I hated how this wasted space looked and the amount of dust it collected. After a few weeks of sourcing materials, we were ready to go! I knew from the get-go that I wanted a white kitchen, as well as shaker-style cabinets with quartz countertops that were marble look-alikes. Other than that, I was pretty open to ideas. Our contractor came over with a wealth of ideas for how we could open the kitchen up to maximize light. (Unfortunately, there are no windows in the kitchen, so there was only so much we could do.) I debated another set of cabinets on top of the current ones, but eventually decided against it. I switched gears a bit on the white color palette, choosing instead a dual-tone kitchen with white uppers and gray lower cabinets. After living with long pulls, I decided to go with smaller handles on all the cabinetry. Quartz countertops were also a must, for the durability factor! With two kids and a husband who are not always the neatest, I knew that we needed a tough work surface. I was adamant about getting a wine fridge. As members of a few wine clubs, we struggled to find space to keep our wine at the right temperatures.</p>

<p>Our microwave above the range was replaced with a microwave drawer, and a hood was installed above the stovetop instead. With the new wine fridge taking up precious cabinet space, I did lose a place for pots and pans. Our contractor was able to give me deep drawers in the pantry to make up for this lost storage. My other kitchen must-haves were a deep, white porcelain sink, and an under-counter pull-out garbage can.</p>

<p>Across the kitchen was a room that held just the washer and dryer with inaccessible space that was wasted. When we extended the wall, there was room for a customized pantry with countertops, shelving, and cabinetry that matched the kitchen. After not having a pantry for so long, it’s amazing to have one, and the additional space has really been a lifesaver. I had envisioned barn doors, but there was not enough wall space for it. The double doors we ended up hanging looked so plain and boring. I had some wallpaper left over from the hallway&#8211;so I went for it and covered the doors too. I think it turned out nicely.</p>

<p>For the bathroom, I wanted a totally new look that was modern and clean. We went with dark floors, a deep soaking tub, and a floating vanity. Our contractor showed me a picture of another bathroom he did, and I loved it so much, we copied it almost exactly. It came out perfectly and I am fighting my older son almost daily for baths! The tub is divine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We actually lived in the space during the whole renovation, which lasted about seven weeks. It was definitely challenging and required a lot of patience. The contractor and his crew were great about cleaning up, however, and we made the best of it with lots of takeout dinners.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading the Sweeten blog for so many years, it was exciting to embark on my own renovation. I realized that renovating is messy and dirty, and almost always takes longer than you had originally anticipated. You learn to roll with the punches, and realize that things happen. We had a few hiccups along the way, such as wanting the barn door on the pantry that wasn’t going to work, so I learned to compromise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoyed working with our Sweeten contractor,  who made himself available at all hours. He was in constant communication and has remained a friend to this day. We love our new kitchen and other improvements, and are planning on staying to enjoy them for many years to come!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 7 small apartment ideas are ideal inspiration for stylish storage and organization</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Living in a city where space is limited can mean giving up square footage in favor of location. Small apartments can feel restrictive; there&#8217;s less room for stuff and fewer zones that can be dedicated to specific functions. When your square footage doesn’t allow for an office, dining room, or storage closet, it’s time to think outside the box. These clever small apartment ideas, brought to life from Sweeten renovations, prove that you can personalize your space to meet your needs in <em>any</em> size apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22053 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="white and black galley kitchen with yellow stools" width="1600" height="2401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01.jpg 1600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<h3>This small kitchen loses a radiator and gets a window seat (plus storage!)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/evelyns-sweetened-manhattan-co-op-homeowner-guest-post/">Evelyn’s</a> galley kitchen suffered from wasted space; there was a radiator beneath the window that was never used. She had it removed and replaced with a window seat with storage underneath, a suggestion given to her by her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228">Sweeten general contractor</a>. Now serving two purposes, the space provides additional storage and a dining nook that seats up to four.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-14.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22054 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="White and gray kitchen in studio apartment" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>A mini kitchen peninsula offers space for work and play</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/">Frans and Dalal’s</a> studio apartment, the kitchen offered very little workspace and barely any room for a table and chairs. By incorporating a mini peninsula into the new kitchen design, the couple was able to add extra prep space and a dining perch that’s perfect for the two of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22055 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11.jpg" alt="Prewar galley kitchen with counter and bar seating in living room" width="3744" height="5616" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11.jpg 3744w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3744px) 100vw, 3744px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>A galley kitchen pass-through creates much-needed counter space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A narrow galley kitchen in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/">Emily&#8217;s</a> studio apartment had virtually no counter space and nowhere to sit down for a meal. By extending the countertop through a newly created pass-through in the wall, Emily was able to define a spot for dining and enhance the social aspect of the kitchen by opening it up to the main living area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22057 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01.jpg" alt="Office and desk nook in closet" width="3744" height="5616" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01.jpg 3744w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3744px) 100vw, 3744px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>A coziest office nook makes its entrance in a small entryway</strong></h3>
<p>Having put a new plan in motion for her kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/">Emily</a> set her sights on a pair of shallow closets that took up valuable floor space in the entryway to her apartment. She combined the closets and carved out an office nook complete with a desk, chair, and open shelving for books and office supplies.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22058 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="Office and desk nook in closet" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Existing closet space in a studio swaps to become an office niche</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The previous owner of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/">Lauren’s</a> studio apartment had knocked out a large closet to create a workspace, replacing it with a tiny closet in the bedroom area. Lauren chose to swap the spaces during her renovation: the home office reverted back to clothing storage while the small closet—which turned out to be the ideal size for a workspace—became an office niche.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22060 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15.jpg" alt="Bed loft platform in studio apartment" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>A lofted bed platform adds clothing storage behind rich wooden tones</strong></h3>
<p>After successfully swapping the small closet for a larger one, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/">Lauren</a> worked with her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315">Sweeten general contractor</a> to think of other ways to add storage and reduce clutter throughout her apartment. In need of a place to store off-season clothes and a folding table and chairs for guests, her contractor rebuilt the existing bed loft platform, adding three bays of storage that were made easily accessible from the foot of the platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22059 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075.jpg" alt="Storage nook above closet in master bedroom" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>Make every inch count—especially if you have tall ceilings!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there’s no more room on the floor, the only way to go is up. To make the most of the 11-foot ceilings in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/west-village-co-op-renovation/">Elizabeth’s</a> apartment, her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/818">Sweeten general contractor</a> suggested using the space to create more storage—an idea she couldn’t say no to. Rather than shoving things under the bed, this alcove is the perfect solution for tucking things out of sight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">—</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amber and Chris made their space work for them by transforming their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/chris-ambers-bathroom-kids-room-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dining nook into a kid&#8217;s bedroom</a> complete with a transom window to allow ample sunlight to pass through.</p>

<p><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></p>
<p>I’m from New York, born and raised in Queens. I’ve been in construction for almost 15 years now.</p>
<p><strong><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;How did you get into construction?&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,17153,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,null,1&#093;">How did you get into the field?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I kind of fell into the industry by mistake. It started with a part-time job while I was in high school working for a friend of the family who had a pretty big construction company. I have some family background in the industry but never gave it any thought. I had always thought of myself as a finance guy but realized I just loved speaking and working with people. I really liked engaging new clients, hearing about their prospective projects, and learning what they were looking to do—and it kind of snowballed from there. Being on jobs and seeing what you uncover during the work, how you fix it and seeing the end result is all really exciting.</p>
<p><strong><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;What do you love most about construction?\n&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,17153,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,null,1&#093;">What do you love most about construction?</span></strong><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;What do you love most about construction?\n&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,17153,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,null,1&#093;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the things I really love is seeing the progression. I love how we take something and have the ability to completely change it; it’s so cool. Seeing a job from start to finish is a lot of fun. My favorite part of the creative side is when we’re going through the planning and the &#8220;teasing out ideas&#8221; phase with our clients—I really enjoy that. Of course, it’s fun to meet new people as well; we’re dealing with different personalities, styles, and properties on a daily basis. There’s always something new around the corner. Needless to say, my job never gets boring!</p>
<p><strong><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;What is your ideal client?&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,17153,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,null,1&#093;">Who is your ideal client?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My ideal client is someone who doesn’t want to be their own general contractor and who can really trust and confide in us for our opinion. This way, we can truly have a collaborative effort in creating a great space for them. Most of our clients are professionals who don&#8217;t have the time to do everything and appreciate the high level of service we provide.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lot of people think that their project is going to be very quick, be able to start the very next day, and be inexpensive, because it’s just a small kitchen or just a small bathroom—they just saw an entire renovation on a television show, which was really weeks or months of work in just 30 minutes! Budgets and timelines! Good things take some time, right? You need to have a professional who has all the proper credentials, certifications, licenses, insurances and really gets the process. Most importantly, you need someone you can gel with. That’s the only way you’ll get the right outcome. For a lot of people we speak to, we need to be clear that there is almost always a wait to start a project. We are usually booked out several months in advance to begin physical work, although we begin working behind-the-scenes right away.</p>
<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge you face when renovating in New York?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the biggest challenges for us is the number of building management companies and how they operate. They all have different turnaround times which can affect a project&#8217;s timeline and can be hard to forecast. Each individual building has its own quirks as well. We work through these things, but it can be challenging at times.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite New York City restaurant?</strong></p>
<p>Joe’s Shanghai is an all-time favorite of mine in New York City. Ultimate comfort food.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite New York City building?</strong></p>
<div>
<p>The Freedom Tower. It has a special meaning to me and many other New Yorkers. To me, it represents progress.

<p><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m from Greece. I’ve been in the industry for 11 years now and have owned my own company for 3.5 years.</p>

<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge you face when renovating in New York?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;The biggest challenge is the time, I think. Even people that invest in properties and they really want to rent it. Time means money for them, especially an apartment like that. They can rent it for seven, eight, or ten thousand a month. They are losing money, so if we lose the timeline, they are losing money. So I think this is the biggest challenge. Finish the project on time.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;">The biggest challenge is time. People who invest in real estate properties and want to rent them out—time means money for them. They can rent it for seven, eight, or ten thousand a month, so if we don&#8217;t complete the project on time, they are losing money. </span></p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;I realize so far that there are many details that cause problems in a project. One thing-- and we usually do it. We do it very often, too. We accept work, and we let the owners purchase the material. Which means that this causes, many times, delays. Let's say, \&quot;Kitchen cabinets.\&quot; I would say 50% of the times the the cabinets come in the apartment, and they are missing parts. So this causes a very big delay. And because, usually everything is custom made, and somebody orders something,\u00a0it takes probably another three weeks to come. And then the counter top guys want to come and measure. It's going to take them another\u00a0at least a week to come and install it. So this makes the homeowners nervous. I think that this is the most important thing.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;">A misconception is that they save money by ordering and handling the deliveries themselves. When we let homeowners purchase materials, there are often delays. Let&#8217;s say kitchen cabinets, I would say 50% of the time, cabinets arrive at the apartment with missing parts. This causes a very big delay, and since everything is usually custom, it probably takes another three weeks to be delivered. Then the countertop guys want to come and measure and that takes at least another week to schedule and install.</span></p>

<p><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;Misconception? I would guess would be mostly he budget pricing and the\u00a0our home owners see what they want to spend, and what is, you know, the exact reality cost for them.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A licensed GC brings protection and accountability to your project</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47784 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>You’ve spent months, even years, dreaming up your home renovation. You’ll want to hire a licensed*, experienced, and professional general contractor to execute the remodel. Make note that the term &#8220;licensed&#8221; can also be referred to as registered or certified.</p>
<p>*An important note: <em>Sweeten contractors are fully licensed in states that have licensing laws. Some states in the United States such as Texas does not license contractors.</em></p>
<p>Renovations can stretch budgets, making it tempting to go with a lower quote from someone who is unlicensed. However, in the long run, this can cost you more—in some cases, a LOT more—if anything goes wrong or the work isn’t up to par. Renovation matchmaker <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> vets all the contractors in its network, and checks in on the project until it’s completed. Cities, states, and towns have varying degrees of requirements for a licensed contractor, but chances are, if you&#8217;re hiring a licensed general contractor he or she will likely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be required to have insurance</li>
<li>Be required to be bonded</li>
<li>Have gone through a criminal background check</li>
<li>Have taken and passed a contractors’ exam</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s why every home remodel should be done by a licensed building professional:</p>
<h3>When do you need to hire a licensed general contractor?</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Projects in New York City that require a license include basement conversions, demolitions, bathroom or kitchen remodels, and wall additions. <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/industry/master-electricians.page"><span class="s2">Specialty skills</span></a> such as an electrician or plumber must have their own license that is specific to their trade even if they are operating as a subcontractor.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">In California, a licensed general contractor is a must for any project above $500. Electrical and plumbing trades must also be licensed for jobs over $500 and are required to take a different exam from a general contractor (more on that below).</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s3">Check your local building department</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The maximum value of a project that can be completed without a license varies from state to state and county to county. It is wise to check with your state and local building department for what project type and size calls for a licensed contractor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In New York City, projects under $200 can be done by someone without a license. Jobs under $500 in California, such as painting can also be completed by someone without a license.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Whether you live in the suburbs or city in most areas of the country, it is very likely that all but the smallest home improvement projects, like swapping out a faucet or painting room, will require a licensed general contractor. </span><span class="s1">Anyone taking on a project over your area’s minimum without a contractor&#8217;s license is doing so illegally. Besides breaking the law, there is no accountability if an issue should arise (more about that below).</span></p>
<h3>You want a contractor who has insurance for your protection</h3>
<p>Your home insurance might cover a few things, but when something goes wrong with a renovation, an average policy won’t cover everything. For example, if a bathtub is installed incorrectly and causes water damage to your floor, your home insurance might cover the water damage. However, it won’t help you when it comes to fixing that shoddy installation job.</p>
<p>With people working in your home, you are something of a pseudo employer. If any workers are injured while on the job in your residence, you could be vulnerable to a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Those reasons are why licensed general contractors are required to carry two types of insurance:</p>
<ul>
<li>General liability insurance: This covers the contractor against any third-party lawsuits involving injury to a person or damage to property. For instance, if your contractor reverses into your neighbor&#8217;s car, the cost of damage is covered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your state, city, or county will dictate a minimum for general liability insurance. In New York City, it is $1 million. If you are remodeling an apartment, your co-op or condo board could request over and above the level required to get a licensed professional in your area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Worker’s compensation: This covers any medical costs associated with a workplace injury for anyone working in your home. It also covers lost wages due to a work-related injury.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do contractors need to have insurance in all states or counties? Although uncommon, <a href="https://www.nextinsurance.com/blog/general-contractor-license-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not every region</a> requires a general contractor to have all types of insurance. For example, <a href="https://generalcontractorlicenseguide.com/nebraska-contractors-license/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nebraska</a> only requires GCs to carry worker’s compensation and not general liability insurance. Just to be safe, it is best to check what your state requires as well as the requirements in your local city or county.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A bonded contractor offers another safeguard</h3>
<p>Many jurisdictions require licensed contractors to contribute to bonding, which offers financial help to clients often when insurance doesn’t. Bonding is a pot of money that pays out clients if a general contractor fails to complete a job, doesn’t do the job properly, or damages a home due to negligence.</p>
<p>Bonding is required basically <a href="https://www.markupandprofit.com/articles/state-by-state-guide-to-general-contractor-bond-amounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everywhere</a>. If your state doesn’t require it, then your local area will. To get a license in New York City, contractors are required to pay $200 into a trust fund with the Department of Consumer Affairs or prove they have a surety bond through a third party. In California, a bond is always done through a third party licensed by the state.  Similar to insurance, the contractor pays a fraction of the bond amount required to a third party, who agrees to pay out the full bond amount if it is needed.</p>
<p>In other states, <a href="https://www.bryantsuretybonds.com/contractor-license-bond/illinois" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like Illinois</a>, there are different bond amounts for different types of work. For example, plumbing contractors must have a $20,000 bond, whereas roofing contractors only need $10,000. Again, as with California, the contractor pays a fraction of this amount to a third party. General contractors in<a href="https://www.suretybonds.org/contractor-license-bonds/florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Florida </a>only need to be bonded if their FICO credit score is below 660.</p>
<h3>Most areas conduct a criminal background check</h3>
<p>Most areas will put applicants through a criminal background check. However, a criminal record won’t automatically disqualify someone from getting their license. It’s likely the licensing department will assess each applicant individually, weighing factors such as the severity of the crime, if it is related to an individual being able to carry out the functions of a contractor, and evidence that indicates rehabilitation.</p>
<h3>Passing a contractor’s exam</h3>
<p>It is common to sit for an exam before a license is issued. How difficult that test is and what questions are asked can vary greatly from area to area. In New York City, 21 out of 30 questions must be answered correctly to pass the exam and be taken by a sole proprietor or general partner owning 10% or more of the company. The questions focus primarily on the knowledge of the city’s regulations and best practices. Examples are “Must a contractor furnish a consumer with a written estimate?” and “What are the penalties for false or fraudulent representation?”</p>
<p>California requires two tests. One is a more general law and business examination that all building professionals must take. In 2018, more than 51,000 exams were scheduled, according to California’s Contractors State License Board. The other is more specific to a contractor’s line of work: general engineering contractor, general building contractor, or specialty contractor. The second test takes more than three hours and contains technical questions such as “According to the California Residential Code, what is the minimum allowable width of a residential hallway?”</p>
<h3>How to check a general contractor’s license</h3>
<p>Always request and check for an HIC number. Many areas make this easily accessible and the information is often through a city or county’s consumer affairs department. For New York City, there is an online search tool where you can check whether a contractor’s license is legitimate and current (a license in the Big Apple lasts for <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/industry/general-contractor-registration.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three years</a>). <span style="font-weight: 400;">In California, where licenses are renewed every two years, there is</span> a similar <a href="https://www2.cslb.ca.gov/onlineservices/CheckLicenseII/checklicense.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online tool</a>.</p>
<p>The United States is a patchwork of state, city and county regulations with licensing requirements differing from place to place but the process your licensed contractor will likely have had to undergo will be similar. In some cases, such as with California, licensing is handled at the state level. In other states, such as New York, licensing is mostly handled by counties. But in some cities, like New York City, it is handled at a city level.</p>
