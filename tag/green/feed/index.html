<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20390 size-full" title="soundproofing" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Soundproofing floors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>(Above) Deniz and Ramon&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/deniz-ramons-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproofed apartment</a> in Brooklyn</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Chances are, if you live in New York City, you’re used to the hustle and bustle of busy streets and vertical living. You’ve learned to sleep through that early morning garbage pick-up, and don’t even notice your upstairs neighbors’ scampering dog anymore. But “acoustic comfort”—as the experts say—is a very personal thing, and certain situations call for some measure of soundproofing to improve your space (for example, you live next to a 10-year construction project or there are six dogs upstairs instead of just one). </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">We consulted Stan Gatland II, an expert on the subject of acoustics and sound comfort at <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CertainTeed</a>, for the basic considerations on how to tackle noise issues and what solutions might work best for your circumstances.</span></p>
<h3>What are the sources of the noise pollution?</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">When it comes to noise pollution, Stan tells us that you can attempt to address the <b>source</b> of the noise—by asking the building’s board to talk to your neighbor, e.g.; you can have the <b>receiver</b> alter his or her behavior—from wearing earplugs to ultimately deciding to move to a different apartment. But given that these two options are not always feasible or desirable, you can aim to minimize noise by obstructing its <b>path</b>, which is how we arrive at soundproofing. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">An important note: Noise takes the path of least resistance, and can be transmitted in two ways. Determining how the sounds are transmitted is crucial to deciding which fixes to apply.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Airborne noise</b> can be either high- or low-frequency, such as your opera singer neighbor or the tuba player on your street corner.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Structure-borne or impact noise</b>, is usually low-frequency. Examples include vibrations from your building’s mechanical systems, a pet or child running in the apartment above, or a chair scraping the floor.</span></p>
<h3>How to reduce noise</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Once you’ve discovered the culprit—and it may be a combination of both airborne and impact noise—you can decide the types of solutions to employ. Airborne sound is usually dampened by adding layers of dense but flexible materials to the surface in question. Impact or structure-borne noise is a more complex matter requiring a professional to &#8220;break&#8221; or minimize the connections between transmission points, usually by adding gaps in the home’s structure (explained below). Some of the major ways to cut the clamor:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Make sure your home is airtight</b></span></span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The level of airtightness will do wonders for your noise problems. On windows, consider double- or triple-pane, as well as weather stripping and caulking, to fill any spaces that sound may travel through. For doors, solid core is best (check out <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">this Sweeten post</span></a> to learn more), and acoustic seals can be applied to the threshold and around the perimeter of the door to fill the gaps. Don’t forget about the small and often overlooked problem areas—such as doorbells, light sockets, and outlets—which are all sound paths. Recessed lighting is a particular offender. Make sure everything is enclosed, capped, and sealed. A tiny gap can amplify the noise exponentially.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>“Float” your walls, ceilings, and floors</b></span></span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Disconnecting the drywall layer from the framing is the best way to address impact noise and reduce airborne sound transmission, and can be done by suspending walls, ceiling, and floors via various methods, says Stan. One way is to add “resilient channels,” essentially metal channels that separate the drywall from the studs so that there are fewer points of connectivity. Another way is by using specially engineered drywall, such as <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SilentFX® QuickCut</a> noise-reducing drywall, a CertainTeed product that uses a viscoelastic polymer between two specially formulated dense gypsum cores that produces the same effect as resilient channels. Floating floors and ceilings use a similar technology to minimize the connections.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Add more insulation and absorptive materials</b></span></span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">&#8220;Light, porous materials are best for absorbing noise, and these can be applied on the surface of the drywall as well as within,&#8221; explains Stan. Often, clay or metal gets mixed into vinyl to create more heft in these acoustic barriers. Additional drywall layers can be helpful too, as can widening the spacing between studs, or using metal rather than wooden ones. In terms of insulation, fibrous materials are best, since they offer the best aspect of trapped air. New constructions will typically have concrete slabs between the floors, which is a great sound dampener. </span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">But fear not—even if you don’t have concrete slabs, there are less involved ways of adding layers to absorb sound. You can add acoustical ceiling tile or wall panel systems to the surfaces in the room. Layering soft materials, such as a tapestry on the walls, thick carpets and drapes, upholstered furniture, and even lush plants will help to reduce noise echo. Placing a shelving unit full of books next to the wall you share with a loud neighbor will also be effective in reducing sound transmission through the adjoining surface. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Can soundproofing be eco-friendly? </span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The measures you take to address sound minimization may also help with energy efficiency and climate control. For example, airtightness and added insulation will guide you toward achieving both goals. As for the materials themselves, most insulation is now low- or no-VOC, and many no longer include formaldehyde. You could go even greener by using <span class="s2"><a href="https://hemptechglobal.com/page15/styled-29/page116.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hemp</a> or</span> <span class="s2"><a href="https://www.goodshepherdwool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wool</a> in place of typical fiberglass insulation. </span> Shredded blue jeans is also a recyclable material used as insulation. These options are typically more expensive for the same effect, however.  </span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>How much does it cost to sound proof?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Now that you’ve had a crash course in soundproofing, it’s time to get started! If you have a simple problem, such as hallway noise coming through your front door, you can resolve it for a few hundred dollars by purchasing an <a href="https://acousticalsolutions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">acoustic door seal kit</span></a> and asking your super to install it. Unfortunately, more extensive problems require specialized expertise, and it may be worth your while to commission a sound analysis or diagnosis report from an acoustics expert. Every situation is different and a pro can help you determine the source and paths of your sound issues, plus suggest appropriate solutions. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">You’ll need to decide how deep a retrofit you are willing to undergo, what kind of budget you have, and how much you&#8217;re willing to be inconvenienced; all are variables that will factor into the solutions an expert suggests. Extensive retrofitting, which will require you to move out of your home, will range from $50 to $80 dollars per square foot for walls, while ceilings and floors will run you $70 to $110 per square foot. Soundproofing can be a complicated process, but to some, silence is golden.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">—</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Planning to add shelves to your home? <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A custom built-in</a> will help dampen noise, taking care of storage and improving soundproofing all in one go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.leedbuilding.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4683793738_fd591a00f5.jpg" alt="LEED FOR HOMES LOGO" /></a></p>
<p>I am not a tree-hugger. I like the idea of nature, but I like it best when witnessed from the confines of <a href="https://www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a lovely glass box</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless I&#8217;m studying for the <a href="https://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEED</a> accreditation exam, which demonstrates leadership in the design and construction of buildings that promote energy-efficiency and resource conservation. The exam covers a lot of dry technical information, and I&#8217;m undertaking it mostly because the credential has become de rigeur for architects. But all this studying has gotten me thinking more seriously about the facts underlying the formulae. I&#8217;m becoming increasingly ecologically-sensitive about the way I live and the products I use.</p>
<p>So more than six months after I completed my kitchen and bathroom remodel I&#8217;m feeling a load of green remorse, disappointment that I wasn&#8217;t more environmentally responsible when selecting products and finishes. So many building products claim that they&#8217;re &#8220;green&#8221; now that it&#8217;s easy to dismiss as a trendy marketing tactic. But each shift in product manufacturing and purchasing, however small, contributes to a much larger shift in consumption that can help us protect our resources.</p>
<p>Here are some things I&#8217;ll do differently the next time I remodel:</p>
<p><b>1. Water-conserving fixtures</b></p>
<p>I although I wasn&#8217;t aware of it at the time, my showerhead and bathroom faucet are designed to minimize water flow. The reduced flow doesn&#8217;t really affect the way the use them, because they have aerators that bolster the reduced flow with additional pressure. My old toilet, which I reused, has a 3-gallon tank. (Think of what a gallon of milk looks like. Isn&#8217;t that a lot of water?) Next time I&#8217;ll install a new toilet with a 1.6 gallon tank or with a dual-flush system that uses a full flush was only when needed.</p>
<p><b>2. Energy-saving appliances</b></p>
<p>The refrigerator, dishwasher and microwave I chose all have Energy Star ratings, which means that they meet or exceed that organization&#8217;s standards. Next time I&#8217;m shopping for appliances I&#8217;d like to compare ratings more closely and try to maximize savings.</p>
<p><b>3. Cabinetry without urea formaldehyde</b></p>
<p>Lots of the plywood and fiberboards used in cabinetry are built with glues that contain urea formaldehyde, a damaging VOC (volatile organic compound) that leaks into the air and into our lungs. When looking for kitchen cabinets next time, I&#8217;ll to find out whether they contain this compound and, if so, what the alternates are.</p>
<p><b>4. Salvaged pieces</b></p>
<p>I bought all of my products brand new. My kitchen is so small that I might have been able to find good wood cabinetry, a good sink, and stone countertops at a consignment shop. Using reclaimed products saves resources and diverts waste from landfills. <a href="https://www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Habitat for Humanity ReStore</a>, <a href="https://reclaimedhome.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reclaimed Home</a>, and <a href="https://unitedhousewrecking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United Home Wrecking</a> are all good places to hunt for spectacular finds.</p>
<p><b>5. Tiles manufactured locally or with recycled content</b></p>
<p>I chose tiles for the kitchen and bathroom without regard for where or how they were made. Next time I&#8217;ll try to source tiles that are manufactured locally, or that have some recycled content. Buying locally helps to prevent emissions from shipping. And many manufacturers that sell at large retailers, like <a href="https://americanolean.com/leed.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Olean</a>, are beginning to incorporate recycled materials into new product lines.</p>
<p><b>6. Low-VOC paint</b></p>
<p>Interior acrylic house paint contains VOC&#8217;s in acceptable, regulated quantities. But several popular companies are manufacturing lines of paint with specially reduced VOC content, like Benjamin Moore EcoSpec.</p>
<p><b>7. Efficient light fixtures</b></p>
<p>A big chunk of the electricity used in our country, about 20%, goes to interior lighting. When selecting undercabinet and ceiling light fixtures I was more concerned with the light quality than with the light source. But different bulbs use very different amounts of electricity. A simple way to save power and money is to choose lights with efficient halogens or LED bulbs, or to use fluorescent bulbs in incandescent fixtures.</p>
