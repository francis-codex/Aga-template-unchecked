										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Real reno ideas to help you maximize studio apartment space</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re downsizing or starting your first adventure in homeownership, buying a studio apartment is a big step. Plus, it typically means one thing: living in a small space. But if there’s one thing we know at Sweeten, it’s that living in a smaller space means you have to live smarter. See how these Sweeten renovators worked with their general contractor to maximize their studio apartment spaces. </span></p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29631 mb-48 size-full" title="studio apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-1.jpg" alt="The smaller closet next to the bed area was converted into a built-in desk" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<strong>1.) Converted Closets</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren’s</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> studio apartment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> definitely needed work. A home office in the place of what could be a large closet was not ideal. Additionally, the kitchen clearly had more to offer than the undersized appliances provided. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with her Sweeten general contractor, they made the space as efficient as possible. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skim coating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and restaining the floors made a big visual impact. Next, they converted the smaller closet next to the bed into a built-in desk. That let them transform the former office space into a large custom closet. In the kitchen, they decided to keep the existing cabinets as they left room for a full-size range.</span></p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37089 mb-48 size-full" title="studio apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-1.jpg" alt="Swapping out sizable fixtures for smaller options helped this apartment owner maximize studio apartment space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<strong>2.) Smart-Sized Fixtures</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage is hard to come by, especially in older buildings and studio apartments. The lack of it across Christina’s </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/alcove-studio-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">550-square-foot-studio </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">was the driving force behind her renovation decision. In the kitchen, a smaller sink, and ceiling-height cabinets accomplished the need for a more efficient space. A wall-length medicine cabinet and vanity solved the storage issues in the bathroom.</span></p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30490 mb-48 size-full" title="studio apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT03.jpg" alt="Adding a kitchen island helped split up this studio apartment into distinct sections" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>3.) Splitting Up Your Space</h3>
<p>Kim and Ian bought a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-studio-co-op-renovated-for-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">450-square-foot studio</a> that required a complete renovation (down to rewiring and replumbing). They planned to “split” the studio into two distinct areas. They wanted one area for cooking and dining and one for living and sleeping. The kitchen island became the main divider between the two spaces. Finally, their contractor made a surprising discovery behind a wall—two old, large windows. He removed them and used the remaining space for more storage and counter space, too.</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Nancy_Apartment-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24436 mb-48 size-full" title="studio apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Nancy_Apartment-09.jpg" alt="A walk in closet helps this homeowner maximize studio apartment space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Nancy_Apartment-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Nancy_Apartment-09-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Nancy_Apartment-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Nancy_Apartment-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Nancy_Apartment-09-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>4.) Adding Finishing Touches</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A benefit of many studio apartments: An </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/movie-set-comes-life-studio-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open floor plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nancy and her Sweeten contractor debated changing the footprint of her new studio, but ultimately decided to keep it as-is. Instead of changing the footprint, they made other changes. They widened the kitchen entrance, added French doors to an existing closet, and added a walk-in dressing room. Lastly, they used printed wallpaper to help define the bedroom as a separate space.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Manhattan home renovates with the right materials and storage</h2>
<p><em>Christina had wanted to remodel her circa 1959 studio co-op in Murray Hill for the five years she’d been living in it. The kitchen and the bathroom were dated, lacked storage space, and were poorly lit. Each year, she&#8217;d revisit the idea of remodeling—even meeting with contractors—but the timing never seemed right between personal and professional commitments (she&#8217;s a financial executive). Hearing so many renovation horror stories also made her hesitate. She discovered <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and took the big step forward. Christina <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27878">posted her project,</a> was matched <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractors</a> and made her selection. Here, she tells her story.</em></p>

<em>Guest post by Christina in Manhattan</em></p>
<p>Putting all my renovation fears aside, I felt my 550-square-foot studio space was not an accurate reflection of my style. The kitchen and bathroom were not well thought out, and the apartment really lacked adequate storage space. For the kitchen, I just used to ignore it by avoiding it altogether, but I couldn’t keep doing that. When I finally met the right contractor through the help of Sweeten, I felt the time had arrived to move forward with updating the space.</p>

<p>Even though it was the kitchen and bath renovations that drove me to get started, there were other things that needed updating. The walls were slightly bumpy in some areas, so I had them <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim-coated</a> [spreading a thin coat of joint compound or &#8220;mud&#8221; on the wall, and then scraping it away to leave a smooth layer] to make everything look as sleek as possible. Also as an artist, I have several of my oil paintings hanging throughout the apartment, so the walls were not all that noticeable, but <span style="color: #000000;">once you update one thing, the flaws in other areas really start to show.</span> Although not part of the original plan, the floors were changed. Upgrading the weak lighting was also a high priority.</p>
<p>My vision for the whole apartment was to look serene, timeless, and glamorous—without overdoing it. I wanted to keep things relatively neutral because my artwork adds pops of color; I didn’t want to create additional “noise.”</p>

<p>The small kitchen didn’t support the existing full-size appliances and was awkward to move around in. The refrigerator was too big and the kitchen lacked counter space, mostly due to a huge sink. That was the number one thing I wanted to correct. With little room to put anything (six inches of usable workspace), I ended up using a foldable table hung on the wall. I could not wait to remove that! The cabinets did not go up to the ceiling—another waste of a significant amount of space that could have been used for storage. The overall configuration became more efficient with a smaller sink and new ceiling-height cabinets. Mission accomplished!</p>

<p>In the bathroom, there was an old pedestal-style sink, leaving no storage space underneath. I have a ton of stuff and am also a neat freak, so I needed all the storage space I could get. I love mirrors that double as storage and insisted on having a larger medicine cabinet. This was a challenge because we had building pipes running behind where the cabinet would be fastened. We found a solution by combining two different-sized ones together; it looks amazing. In both the kitchen and bathroom, I paired Calacatta marble with wood-looking floor tiles for continuity. I knew that was the look I wanted even before shopping for materials. My contractor played an integral role in selecting the materials, offering a lot of ideas on what would look good and what might not work. He also helped <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customize the kitchen cabinets</a>.</p>
<p>I admit I have expensive taste, and sometimes I got carried away with wanting very high-end materials. My contractor helped me stay on track and we found a lot of reasonably priced options at Home Depot for things like light fixtures.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36979 mb-0 size-chrono" title="photo-of-christina-behind-chair" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-01-723x482.jpg" alt="photo of christina standing behind a chair after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>The original floors were damaged by water from a pipe bursting. I wanted a high contrast between the floors and walls and couldn’t believe what a huge difference it gave to the look and vibe of the apartment. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproof layer</a> was included per the building’s request. The entire removal and installation was surprisingly a relatively fast process.</p>
<p>I was most excited about redoing the kitchen; that was the area that bothered me the most. The thought of having everything finally the way I wanted it (within the constraints of the building requirements and existing structure) made me very happy. I was also really excited to be involved in every aspect of the project and learning about construction in Manhattan. After investing a lot of time and energy into the new finishes and design, I feel a greater sense of emotional ownership towards everything in my home. I&#8217;ve been traveling a lot lately, but I can&#8217;t wait to leverage the new appliances and kitchen to their full potential.</p>
<p>The space is now an accurate reflection of my style and personality. It makes me feel at peace and happy to come home every day knowing every single thing is exactly how I wanted it. I feel a great sense of pride in the final product.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</b></span>: Combine multiple closets for more efficient storage</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: When Melissa Young first set eyes on her new apartment, she was thrilled. It was a sunlit studio space on the corner of a beautiful prewar building with plenty of windows and charm. But she knew there was a lot to be done, given that the last renovation had occurred sometime in the ‘70s. Every surface was caked with paint a quarter-inch thick (including light switches!), and the floors were badly damaged. Melissa laid out a multi-step plan as soon as she closed. Feeling overwhelmed with the number of issues, she decided to tackle a relatively simple project first—the dearth of storage—and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19335" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached out to Sweeten to be matched with contractors</a>. There were three tiny closets off the entry hall with low doorways preventing her from maximizing the vertical space available inside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>After</b></span>: With the help of her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2536" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a>, Melissa designed the largest closet doors that would fit in the space, working with California Closets to outfit the interior to create a functional, beautiful design with a mix of hanging and open shelving space. Her Sweeten contractor knocked down the wall separating two closets but left a third intact to use as a pantry space, since it was directly across from the galley kitchen. He also wired it so that her microwave and toaster oven could sit within the pantry. And although the project was intended to just focus on the closets, discussion with her contractor resulted in updates to the flooring, doors, walls, and radiators as well. In the end, Melissa’s studio had beautiful new herringbone wood floors in the hallway, refinished parquet in the main room, new baseboards, and molding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: In the process of scraping the front door, the contractor discovered that underneath a hundred years’ worth of paint was “this gorgeous metal with amazing character.” They scraped all the door frames throughout the apartment as well, uncovering the same beautiful metal patina.</p>

This new studio, in a historic townhouse, offered original wood floors and the promise of exposing structural bricks beneath the plaster. The very basic and uninspired kitchen, however, was a distinct liability. Shoved into a shallow alcove, it had entry-level appliances and only a few inexpensive cabinets.<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Giovanni’s co-op approved his renovation proposal to combine a small closet and the alcove into an open plan for both cooking and laundry, so he turned to Sweeten for his project. His <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> helped shape the vision, and was “very good at telling me what was feasible.” Giovanni says. Breaking the plaster surface off structural brick walls proved an inexpensive way to add texture to the plain-vanilla apartment. Enlarging the kitchen footprint slightly, he added an eat-in peninsula to hide the washer-dryer while keeping pipes in roughly the same position. The backsplash is clad with matte gray subway tiles. To keep costs down, black-painted butcher block countertops offer a warmer temperature than stone. Overhead, a dropped ceiling provided space for new electrical wiring, for the high-tech pendants over the breakfast bar and for recessed lighting.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Glossy white cabinets look lush, and using stainless trim above lifts the dropped ceiling by helping it appear to float.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">For Frans, a real estate broker, and his wife, Dalal, downsizing from a 2,500 square foot Flatiron District loft to a one-bathroom studio in neighboring Gramercy Park raised only one challenge: Where to put the mudroom! Size was hardly an issue for this unflappable couple, who set out to fit a few custom features into a much lower-maintenance space and came to Sweeten for a general contractor who could bring the vision together. Read on to see how they made room for a mudroom, master closets, and sleeping space for four in this mighty studio!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20138 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-25-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><span id="more-18627"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal were happy to leave behind extra square footage but wanted to bring a few specific features to their new home: A mudroom, to ward off sooty and sometimes snowy layers from city streets, wardrobe closets organized for two, and modern electrical wiring that would support an integrated system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They’d decided on this particular studio apartment because it offered a smaller but markedly similar version of the living room in their loft, and because eventually they planned to relocate to Long Island. So, a revamp would make this home convenient and comfortable until their next adventure, and put everything in place for a future crash pad. Frans enlisted a<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>to achieve the loft-like space they had in mind, while personalizing a number of key features throughout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main studio space was a standard boxy room that backed up to one wall of windows and existing decor was mostly dark and decades old. Because of the single source of light, it took some imagination to carve up the room for use in different ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal designated the windowed area as their new living room, and aimed to update and expand the kitchen, bathroom, and wardrobes while incorporating an urban mudroom into a large hall closet. They also wanted to replace all of the dated finishes throughout the apartment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting with the dark parquet floors, their contractor and his team made way for 7-inch white oak planks from Siberian Wood Flooring, and installed them throughout the home, even replacing the kitchen’s old linoleum black and white floors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original 6 x 8-foot kitchen nook offered very little workspace surrounded by drab brown decor. Directly across from the nook was an oversized closet, which Frans hoped to incorporate into a new, larger kitchen design. The team took on major demolition to create a larger footprint and a workable U-shape, allowing for openness and access. They designed and built custom kitchen cabinetry, finished in putty-gray paint for the bottom cabinets, and white with glass panels for the upper line with seamless metal hardware. A number of cool custom features for specific storage needs are sprinkled throughout, and walnut shelving over the new under-mount sink helps extend the kitchen&#8217;s depth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">White linoleum counters were tossed and replaced with natural white Bianco Brazilian marble with gray veining. Frans and Dalal chose a matte white glass subway-style tile for the backsplash, which now runs up the length of the wall by the new island, where two dining seats, plenty of additional counter space, and black pendant lighting are in easy reach. Top-grade stainless steel appliances replaced the tiny outdated white units, and a large professional-grade hood was fashioned over the 30-inch Bertazzoni gas oven range.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the old closet, their contractor turned part of that into the mudroom Frans and Dalal were after, complete with custom shelving and various storage needs. And as an extension for the new kitchen, white custom cabinetry conceals the refrigerator and houses an exposed wet bar and wine fridge.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal worked with Kris to create two customized and flexible sleeping spaces. Kris built sliding accordion doors out of walnut wood and opaque resin that stack together out of the way when opened, or become solid partition walls when extended and closed off.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom section, Kris built a king-sized platform bed and matching nightstands. In the living room, the team devised a plan for a customized built-in wall unit, incorporating a queen-sized murphy bed and guest closet all conveniently and seamlessly hidden behind white lacquered plywood. Across the room from this addition, Kris installed a single walnut shelf running alongside the wall and just off the floor to corral entertainment equipment and living room knick-knacks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Frans and Dalal had a few simple ideas in mind. Plain white tiles, dim lighting, and very old superficial hardware had outworn their welcome. The couple planned to get rid of all the existing dated decor, change the footprint to allow for a larger, more accessible layout, and customize the adjoining closet to cater to “his and her” needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kris tore everything out and rotated the footprint by 90 degrees to swap the shower and vanity, allowing for greater use of space overall. Old floor tiles were ripped out and light gray ceramic tiles, mimicking that of stone, went down in their place. Upon entering the bathroom directly off the bedroom, you’ll find an oversized white porcelain sink nestled into a new walnut wood vanity built entirely by Kris, finished with ultra modern red and silver metal hardware. To the left of the vanity stands a new glass shower, bedecked with skateboard street-art-style wall tiles for a very artistic, creatively modern, and very hip “New York” aesthetic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new wardrobe situation is impressive. A walk-in closet was already in place, but the couple had a better plan to build a more streamlined and highly organized pass-through closet. Using the door to the old closet, Kris custom built movable shelving units out of corresponding walnut wood for shoes and other sections for hanging clothes. These movable units lead to a separate bathroom entry to the back of the studio, where the living room sits. The homeowners also gained a new compact washer/dryer to complete the turn-around.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Not one to miss the tiniest of details, Frans had the entire apartment wired for temperature, lighting, and sound control he conveniently accesses via phone. Frans and Dalal not only got the mudroom, but also managed to fold in multiple, flexible spaces to this origami apartment. Their new “studio” might be the only one in all of Manhattan with as many separate rooms as they now have, perfectly positioned within one unique space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years after Kelly purchased her studio apartment in a lovely Brooklyn Heights co-op, she was ready to take on a major overhaul of the old appliances and cheap cabinets in the kitchen and bath. Unsure of the style she was after, Kelly sought the help of a designer who could run with big transformations to her little abode. Read on for our reveal of Kelly’s sparkling new kitchen, bathroom, and bonus closet renovations!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kellys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-sweeten-brooklyn-heights/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17853" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kelly-kitchen2.jpg" alt="brooklyn heights co-op" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kelly-kitchen2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kelly-kitchen2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-17835"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><i>“Courtney was fantastic! Her process for learning about the project, the space potential, and understanding who I am is her true talent. I always felt that I had a voice and control over the design, which was important to me, but Courtney effortlessly brought it to life.”<br />
</i><i><i></i></i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><i><i>-Kelly, Brooklyn Heights homeowner</i></i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly had come to realize that living in a studio apartment meant that the kitchen would forever be the focal point—it “needed to rock”, as she put it. With old appliances and “cheap” cabinets and counters, the kitchen lacked a ton of functionality. An earlier attempt at open shelving left all sorts of things exposed, the cabinets extended just halfway to the ceiling, bar seating offered zero storage topped with a thin strip of counter prep space, and the stove and fridge were both miniature-sized. Kelly wanted to find an interior designer whose imagination wasn’t limited by tight spaces. She </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched her with Sweeten Expert Courtney</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a pro at bringing ambitious texture and color to spaces large and small. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17851" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Kelly wasn’t yet set on any specific style choices for her kitchen, Courtney was able to provide plenty of inspiration to get the renovation process started. The plans called for a few big fixes: Kelly’s team would extend the kitchen cabinets to ceiling height for more storage and finish the cabinetry with a variety of classic doors and transparent glass panes. The bar counter was significantly enlarged, granting more prep and dining space and doubling the kitchen’s drawer storage. And to accommodate a full-sized stove and fridge, Kelly moved the fridge out of the galley altogether.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly appreciated Courtney’s talent for mixing affordable items with the right amount of higher-end items for a polished look. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previous flooring consisted of brick-colored tiles that dragged the room into darkness. Kelly chose eye-catching cement tiles in a white and soft black mosaic, evoking a sense of Moroccan-inspired decor. Kelly bid adieu to the old, sagging cabinets and selected a dove gray IKEA set for the bottom base with a matte white finish for the uppers, plus elegant chrome hardware for all. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her newly-enlarged bar counter, Courtney helped Kelly pick butcher block for its warmth and price point, offsetting that material with a natural stone for the opposite counter. Ready to pack a lot of texture into the small space, Kelly added another pop of personality with a subway-style backsplash of luminous blue hand-glazed ceramic tiles. This detail, along with new undercabinet lighting was the key to unlocking all of that brightness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rickety oven range was replaced with a sleek stainless stove and Kelly scored a matching microwave stationed directly above it. A new dishwasher now resides where the old fridge once stood, and Kelly had new storage and pantry cabinets constructed along the opposite wall, framing the fridge perfectly. Kelly did away with the harsh ceiling light and opted for low-profile recessed lighting instead, complementing her new space gorgeously.  </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17844 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="dove gray ikea cabinets" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renovation plan grew to include the bathroom as well as the secret to the success of any great NYC studio: a highly organized walk-in closet! Without changing the footprint of the bath, Kelly carried several of the design choices from the kitchen over for continuity and coherence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went with the same marbled stone look for the floors and shower walls while replacing the tub with a new white porcelain upgrade. In other splash-prone areas surrounding the sink and shower, Kelly decided on a pale gray glass tile stacked in clean, contemporary lines. The old vanity was replaced with a dark wood cabinet boasting deep storage drawers and a large rectangular sink basin, crowned with a simple mirror and a soft-glow lighting strip. Two chrome shower heads were installed, one flexible and the other stationary, creating an elegant spa oasis. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last perk of this smart renovation came in the form of customizing the studio’s remaining closet, including shelving, section dividers, and a full-length mirror. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly’s lovely, revamped studio is proof that no space is too small for showcasing personal taste and imagination. We’re thrilled to hear that Courtney’s eye for design and hustle helped Kelly re-create this beautiful space!</span></p>
