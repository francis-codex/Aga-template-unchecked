<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Remodeling pre-war homes in the Washington, D.C. area presents a rewarding challenge. It’s an opportunity to take a piece of the city’s history and both preserve and improve it. You can create a home with more mojo—a home with historic style and contemporary functionality.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Sweeten</span><span class="s1"> offers an outline on what to know before starting older home renovations in Washington, D.C. (plus, which rooms get the most bang for the buck!) </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/washington-dc-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Where do you start when renovating an old house?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Start with your vision for the result. Consider all that you want and prioritize those features with your budget. Talk with a contractor as early in the process as possible. Go over the mandatory elements, such as electrical and plumbing, that will have to meet current code requirements. Older homes typically need complete upgrades of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p6"><span class="s1">Electrical: Older homes need more outlets, plain and simple. Adding plenty of USB outlets makes sense, too, as they allow you to dispense with the extra adapter. Many older homes still suffer from antiquated lighting, with just a solitary ceiling fixture, if that. Energy-efficient puck lights and sconces should be part of any renovation. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">In addition, an updated home should have a 200-amp service, which you’ll learn about through an electrical audit. If you want photovoltaic panels and are allowed to install them, discuss whether the system should be part of your planning with your contractor.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p6"><span class="s1">Plumbing: Efficiency and style have taken over in plumbing, as shown by low-flow “waterfall” showerheads, wall-mounted toilets, and so on. As for the “guts,” of the plumbing system, you can choose a tankless water heater and never run out of hot water, or go with a heat-pump water heater for greater efficiency.</span></li>
<li class="p6"><span class="s1">HVAC system: Improvements abound in HVAC systems, with heat pumps and mini-split systems increasingly popular, along with more effective air filtration systems and energy recovery ventilators becoming standard in many places.</span></li>
<li class="p6"><span class="s1">Windows: Unlike electrical, plumbing, and HVAC, windows are both functional and aesthetic elements, and can vary hugely in cost. Some windows offer more user-friendly features such as opening farther, while others are focused on maximum performance with triple panes and advanced coatings. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Improved performance is laudable, but costs can balloon for small gains in performance. Your choice of windows is a judgment call, so go over this carefully with your general contractor. You should also do research on the window manufacturers and products so you can learn and ask questions. Windows are a major expense (and are not easily changed,) so take the time to get it right.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="basement bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48731" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></span></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner Nicole remodeled her <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/a-sibling-duo-renovates-an-arlington-basement-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement bathroom in Virginia</a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Commonly renovated elements in old homes</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li8"><span class="s5">Woodwork: Other elements that often need help include woodwork, built-ins, and floors. Pre-war homes were often hand-crafted with excellent materials, as there were no reasonable alternatives. Time takes its toll, however, and your home’s woodwork may be showing its age. Unless you want a different look or the materials are badly degraded or damaged, it’s often the best and most cost-effective choice to overhaul the existing elements.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s5">Architectural salvage pieces may have a place in your renovation, as well, and it can be enjoyable to go see what’s available. Your builder, architect, and interior designer will be invaluable in this endeavor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s5">Distressed plaster walls are also a common feature of pre-war homes. Considering the simple materials used, plaster walls are amazing and hold up well. They lend a feeling of solidity and just feel appropriate in an older or historic building. They do tend to crack more readily with settling than newer drywall construction.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Fortunately, this is a relatively easy fix—getting the right plaster pro on the job. Your contractor will make sure new and old blends perfectly, make repairs properly, and leave you feeling great about this subtle yet important element. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="White and blue modern kitchen with little girl sitting on the quartz countertop after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51578" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></span></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Brandi and Chris <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-remodel-rockville-md-for-a-multigenerational-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovated their Maryland kitchen</a></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Kitchen upgrades in old homes</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Because of the intensity of use as the hub of most homes, your kitchen deserves more focus and more of the budget. Not surprisingly, you’ll make more materials and feature choices for the kitchen, as well. Do you really want a six-burner range, or should that money go elsewhere? One feature we strongly recommend is the best cabinets you can afford. Here, you have options.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Off-the-rack” cabinets have improved tremendously in the last few years as manufacturers have stepped up to meet the demand for both style and functionality. By their nature, off-the-rack or in-stock cabinets will offer fewer choices, but that may be fine if you’re happy with the finishes and sizes offered.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Semi-custom and custom cabinets can provide nearly anything you want, such as finishes, specialized hardware, and sizes to fit any space. </span><span class="s7">You can usually expect upgraded</span><span class="s1"> cabinets to show better fit and finish, but you might have to wait for them to be built. This shouldn’t be a problem, as you’ll have many renovation tasks to complete before the cabinets go in.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Another upgrade that might fly under your radar is a heavier sink, either of stainless steel or synthetic material. This is a subjective thing, but heavier sinks just feel solid and have a better, quieter tone with water running on them.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Exterior elements have endured a lot</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Outside, the humid climate in Washington, D.C. is no friend to structures. The mortar in historic brick buildings, for example, needs maintenance periodically. </span><span class="s8">Old bricks were much softer than current bricks, and older lime mortars were more flexible than modern mortars. These older materials worked well together.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Today, however, modern mortar costs about half of the traditional lime mortar, so many repairs over the last couple of decades have used the newer, less pliable mortar, leading to bricks cracking and crumbling, instead of the mortar.</span><span class="s9"> Typically, you’ll find lime mortar in cream or black tones, while the modern mortar is gray. Check this out and talk with your contractor about how much work needs to be done.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Challenges for layout changes and additions</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While these renovation decisions are happening, consider the layout of your home. Does it work for your family, or does it need help? The need for a more functional design may in fact be the driving force behind the entire renovation. Do you need more square footage or just a refinement of the layout? Whether or not you’re able—either physically or legally—to add more square feet is a major factor.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Row homes, for example, may be impossible to add on to. For other homes, setbacks and/or various associations may prohibit changing the home’s footprint, even if the lot has room. If your contractor has worked on other projects in your neighborhood, he or she may already know what’s possible. Nonetheless, it doesn’t hurt to double-check with your historic district.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Allowing for surprises</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It’s inevitable to have a few surprises while remodeling pre-war homes. But budgeting for them and preparing mentally, plus going through the house thoroughly with your contractor, will minimize the chances of a major surprise. You’ll also have permits to pay for, and for this, you’ll want to coordinate with your contractor.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_7271-e1500769492943.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28363 size-chrono" title="restaurant renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-renovations-chikarashi-restaurant-nomad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chikarashi renovation</a> by Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect Steven</a> and Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor Carl</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurant renovation costs are hardly a prix fixe situation; they can vary dramatically based on the project. Is it a turnkey situation, where you’re planning to open up in a former restaurant location that already has a kitchen, gas, and electrical? Or are you starting from scratch? The city you’re in will also impact the cost, as will the quality of the finishes and the other professionals you hire for your team. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractor, offers some categories to account for and tips on how to draw up an initial budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.buildingjournal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building Journal</a> puts the national average cost for a 5,000-square-foot restaurant with mid-level finishes at $160 a square foot, or $480,000. This can include the build-out, permits, equipment, and design. That cost is higher if you’re based in an expensive city such as New York ($216 per square foot) or Philadelphia ($180 per square foot). &#8220;We tell chefs in NYC who are typically looking at a 2,000-2,500 sq/ft space for a 50-80 seat restaurant that costs can range from $300-350 per square foot for the front of house and $200 per square foot for the back of house,&#8221; says Jonathan Garnett, the creative director at architectural firm MNDPC. &#8220;Multiply that by the 2,000-square-foot space and you have a ballpark.&#8221; Note that this scope does not include furniture, fixtures or restaurant equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What your food and beverage establishment will cost is unclear until you sit down to develop a budget. Here are elements to seriously consider when pulling together an initial budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46400" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png" alt="find general contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Design for a Restaurant Renovation</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For some, starting a restaurant is a creative endeavor, so they prefer to work closely with their general contractor, architect or designer on the design. Some smaller projects like a cafe might not warrant hiring a restaurant designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s a huge range: Those looking to bring in a designer could pay as little as $25,000 or as much as $400,000 and beyond, according to Jimmy Haber, from <a href="https://e2hospitality.com/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESquared Hospitality</a>, which has a long list of successful restaurant ventures all over the world. <span class="s1">The cost depends on the “celebrity” quotient of the designer, whether the space requires a lot of alterations in order to implement a certain design, or </span><span class="s1">how elaborate the decor will be. </span>A restaurant designer won’t just help with the look and feel of the place, but also the all-important layout. The layout will greatly impact the flow of service from kitchen to patron and your staff’s ability to do their job during busy moments. Bringing in an architect early on in the process will provide cost-effective expertise from start to finish, saving time and headache. Basic services include drawing up schematics and submitting the Certificate of Occupancy, but a full-service architect can provide guidance from project management to various levels of interior design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A designer&#8217;s expertise could also increase the number of seats in the establishment, increasing income in the long run. “By the time you construct and open your restaurant, the mistakes are already there and it is too late,” said Jimmy, on why a designer is worth considering. If you’re big on the creative aspect, then make sure you select a designer who you feel will work within your vision rather than commandeer it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Review the MEPs: mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is critical to do before even renting or buying a space (if you’re at this stage, read our earlier <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>). Perhaps the MEPs are so far gone you will opt for a different venue altogether. Regardless, accessing the MEPs will help you set a realistic budget. For example, a decrepit HVAC system can blow the budget out by tens of thousands of dollars, according to Dan Soloway, a hospitality consultant with Kitchen Options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In big bureaucratic cities like New York, connecting the gas can take months, which is why Jimmy no longer uses gas appliances in his establishment. He only uses electric to save clients from costly delays of connecting gas.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Permits for a Restaurant Renovation</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fitting out a new restaurant or renovating an existing one will rope in a lot of government departments—the fire department, the gas provider, buildings department, etc.—from whatever town or city you’re in. The actual permits can be a low-cost item on a budget (Jimmy estimates less than $5,000), but getting those approved can add substantially to the overall restaurant renovation cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before you sign a lease, always check the <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certificate of occupancy</a> (CO). This will dictate what the space can be used for. If it doesn’t give permission for a food and beverage establishment, changing it could be expensive and time-consuming, or in some cases, impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve checked the CO, Jimmy recommends spending the $25,000 or so to bring in a mechanical engineer, a kitchen consultant, and a lawyer. That team can look over everything from the liquor license (if the location has one, which is ideal) to the MEPs that we mentioned above. If these areas are not up to par, that could delay the approval of your permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What if your location isn&#8217;t already approved for a liquor license? It has become increasingly common for clauses to allow restaurateurs to exit the lease if a liquor license application is denied, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. “That’s because the business might hinge on your ability to sell alcohol,” he said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>General construction</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Floors might still need to be laid and bathrooms built or renovated. A survey of more than 700 responses from the industry publication <a href="https://www.restaurantowner.com/public/Survey-How-Much-Does-it-Cost-to-Open-a-Restaurant.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Restaurant Owner</a> found for a medium restaurant—around 3,200 square feet—construction alone or build-out cost an average $50 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if it is a turnkey restaurant, things like accessibility must be up to current standards, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slavica, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Equipment</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The restaurant renovation cost of fitting out a bar and kitchen, including all the equipment like burners and espresso machines, can be a big budget line item. The Restaurant Owner’s survey put the average cost of a 1,000-square-foot bar and kitchen, including the equipment, at about $75,000, or $80 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurateurs can buy second-hand equipment, but first, they must do their due diligence. That usually involves spending a few hundred dollars for a technician to look over the equipment before buying it, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. There is also the option to lease equipment, which means a reduced upfront payment, but possibly more in the long run. However, the leasing company normally handles repairs and might even provide things like detergent with a dishwasher.</p>
<h3><b>Rent and labor contingency</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, things can go wrong in a renovation. On average, the Restaurant Owner’s survey found that the overrun on a restaurant remodel budget to be 34 percent. Numerous hurdles can slow down your opening and delay that exciting moment when you make your first sale. Meanwhile, you&#8217;re still paying rent for the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I think your pre-opening rent can be a big wild card. It usually takes much longer to open than you think it does,” said Jimmy, from ESquared Hospitality. A six-month rent contingency can be a business-saver, as is a few months&#8217; contingency for staff costs. Sometimes staff members are already hired—manager, chef, sommelier, etc.—and on the payroll when a delay arises. A labor contingency means you can continue paying them during the delay. Otherwise, they could look for new jobs, which means starting the hiring process from scratch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assessing and writing a restaurant renovation cost plan is like charting a new land—confusing, tedious, and with a few questions marks. However, having a realistic budget can set you up for success while bringing you one step closer to your dream business. Here is a budget breakdown for a 2,000-<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">square-foot</span> <span style="color: #000000;">restaurant in</span> <span style="color: #000000;">New York City by</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Tony</a><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Modernize a bath in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Older apartments often come with quirks, especially with plumbing. In Lori’s 1930 co-op apartment in Brooklyn, one of those quirks materialized as a two-foot square platform that elevated the toilet by three inches. “It was protruding into the small room,” said Lori. To make the space more open, the platform needed to go. As did the dark blue faux marble tiles, which made the bathroom seem heavy. A vanity also needed to be retired. “It was an awful, dark, scratched up wood that we temporarily painted,” said Lori. Plus, it didn’t provide much storage.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: She decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/18406" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post her project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects renovators with vetted general contractors. Of course, solving an old plumbing issue is easier said than done. Lori’s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> discovered the toilet’s waste pipe was crucial to the apartment floors above (her apartment is on the first floor). The toilet plumbing required additional room, hence the platform. However, her contractor figured out a workaround by cutting a stack of plywood into the shape of the new toilet base. He then stacked them under the new toilet, which was lower than the old one, to give the plumbing the additional space it needed. “The plywood was covered with a small mosaic tile that blends into the floor tile,” said Lori. “It’s barely noticeable now.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The newly renovated look leaned on bright whites with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patterned floor tile</a> to add some excitement. The floating wooden <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> offers a warm pop of color as well as storage, but when Lori first saw it in the new space, it looked bigger than she had hoped. Her Sweeten contractor had another practical fix for that, moving it two inches lower down the wall. “That made it much less obtrusive and we were really happy with it after,” she said.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Lori had not decided on a general contractor yet when she spoke with Miranda in client services at Sweeten about who would be a good match for her project. Miranda described the previous projects of the Sweeten contractor Lori ultimately picked. She also saw a Sweeten blog post on a previous project. “It was great to have someone to talk to behind an online service,” she said.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29717 mb-10 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation cost" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label"> (Above) Brooke and Paul&#8217;s Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/1920s-westchester-home-gets-a-modern-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation</a> in Pelham, New York</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Westchester County </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no doubt that Westchester is a picturesque place to live—the luxury of space and peace with the bustle of New York City a quick trip away. Some recent buyers and established homeowners alike feel it would be even more idyllic if they had their dream kitchen, whether it&#8217;s renovating a new home or fulfilling a long-desired wish to upgrade. The first step is often the stumbling block: determining the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/kitchen-renovation-costs-money-goes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">national average</a> for a basic 200-square-foot kitchen renovation is $63,829.  Westchester County has a slightly higher average <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation cost</a> landing at <strong>$65,651</strong> or <strong>$328 a square foot</strong>, according to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association (NKBA). Let’s break that budget down into bite-sized pieces to help you get closer to your dream cooking and entertaining space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DESIGN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an important line item in your budget, especially if your vision involves a layout change. That could involve moving load-bearing walls and gas lines. The NKBA estimates design fees eat up about four percent of a kitchen remodel cost. Sweeten designer <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, who has done work in Westchester, said it&#8217;s more realistic to put away 15 percent of your budget for design if you’re in the mood for a major layout change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re giving your kitchen more of a makeover than an overhaul, it’s possible to work closely with an experienced general contractor on the design and forgo a designer. Statistics from the NKBA show that the majority of homeowners relied on a general contractor and only 22 percent used a designer. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck</a>, a Sweeten contractor who works in Westchester, has found that many clients in the county take a hands-on approach to design and often don’t use a designer or architect. However, an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect&#8217;s services will be needed</a> if plumbing or gas lines are moving, there are structural changes, or if a landmark property is being renovated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PERMITS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building permits are handled by the building department of each individual town within Westchester County. &#8220;Individual&#8221; is the key word here because methods of calculations can change dramatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Rye, the most of the <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/money/real-estate/homes/2017/03/22/westchester-priciest-zipcodes/99506058/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive</a> area in Southern Westchester—the median price for a home is $1,380,000—it’s no surprise that building permits are calculated based on the cost of a renovation. For every $1,000 in your kitchen remodel budget, that’s an additional $17 for your building permits. That average $64,000 kitchen overhaul will cost at least $1,088 in permits. If plumbing and electrical permits are required, that’s an additional $200 a pop (for a less extensive renovation, these permits may not be necessary).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the township of Peekskill, building permit costs are at the end of a minor mathematical equation. Multiply the square footage of your project by $150. Then, multiply that figure by 0.10. For a 200-square-foot kitchen, that’s $3,000. So take a moment to look at how the building department of your township calculates permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/westchester-county-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-34831 size-full" title="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png" alt="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" width="320" height="60" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png 320w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>APPLIANCES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Village Appliances in Westchester, a budget appliance package (fridge, oven, dishwasher and microwave), can go for under $5,000. However, Joe Gagliardo, the owner of Village Appliances, doesn’t sell too many of those. The majority of customers either go for a package in the $5,000 to $8,000 range or in the mid-price range of $18,000 to $22,000, which will get you brands such as General Electric and Electrolux. The high-end price spectrum will deliver brands such as Viking and Miele for a four-piece suite (fridge, range, hood, and dishwasher) at a price ranging from $17,000 to $26,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At <a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bilotta Kitchens</a>, clients often buy in the $12,000 to $15,000 range for an appliance package, according to senior designer and CKD Randy O’Kane. This will get you brands such as Thermador, Sub-Zero, and Wolf. There’s always room to mix and match, but brands do offer a discount or throw in items like blenders, toasters and hoods for free if you go with the same brand for your appliances, Randy said. “It is the heart and soul of a kitchen,” she said. “Cabinets are great, but it is all about cooking.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation can cost between $500 and $1,000, and that price will depend on how much work your contractor has already done. If water lines have not been run or outlets are not in the necessary areas, that could push up installation costs, Joe said. For those after custom range hoods, then plan for the $2,000 and $8,000 range.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-peninsula-golden-chairs" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-32475 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen peninsula with golden chairs and blue kitchen cabinets with silver appliances after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label">(Above) Tracey and Brian&#8217;s Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-stamp-of-approval-for-a-westchester-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation</a> in Pelham Manor, New York</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CABINETS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinets and hardware (think handles and knobs) are a big-ticket item on every kitchen remodel cost budget. They typically take up 30 percent of costs, according to NKBA. In a basic kitchen renovation, that’s $6,000. For a major overhaul worth $60,000, cabinets cost almost $20,000. What typically makes a big <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difference in cabinet cost</a> is whether you want custom, pre-fabricated or a mix of both. Something pre-fabricated from IKEA or Home Depot will cost around $130 a linear foot. Custom jobs can shoot up to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear square foot</a>. However, with that higher price, there is more freedom in deciding your kitchen layout. You can also get <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a> with custom cabinets. Semi-custom cabinets generally are about 50 percent cheaper than full custom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or do what Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill did in her own kitchen renovation: the recycled customized option. &#8220;I scoured Renovation Angel&#8217;s website and purchased a used-but-high-end kitchen for about $10,000, which is what I could have spent on cabinets alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A complete kitchen included appliances and cabinetry.&#8221; Jean then customized the cabinets to fit her space, which often meant filler panels were wider on one side than the other, or building a soffit was necessary. &#8220;It was like working on a jigsaw puzzle in order to make the kitchen look like it fit in the space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I was okay with these kinds of imperfections in exchange for essentially getting a premium kitchen on an Ikea type of budget.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>COUNTERTOPS</strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.westchesterkitchenandbath.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester Kitchen and Bath</a>, quartz is overwhelmingly the most popular countertop, according to showroom manager and designer Donna Magnotta. “It’s heat-, stain-, scratch-, and bacteria-resistant,” she said, “and it&#8217;s maintenance-free.” Natural stones, like marble, need routine staining and sealing. Quartz starts around $85 per linear foot and is on the mid to high-end of the price scale, which includes the cost of fabricating and installing. Laminate starts at $20 a linear foot, but is rarely purchased, Donna said. Granite is next up the ladder at about $35 a linear foot. On the high end, natural stones start at about $120 a linear foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LIGHTING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kitchen lighting isn’t a big budget line item. It takes up on four percent of total costs on average. The end price, of course, will always be determined by your tastes. In a $20,000 kitchen, that’s only $800. For a major remodel in the $60,000 range, lighting costs look closer to $2,400.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PLUMBING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On an average remodel, plumbing costs are about the same at $800. If there is a layout change to your Westchester kitchen, then that will likely add to your plumbing costs, which also includes gas lines. And the more you alter the basic layout of your space, the more your kitchen remodel cost will increase for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting, and inspections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FLOORING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a budget, Westchester’s <a href="https://suburbanfloors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suburban Floors</a> has a vinyl Karndean-Knight Tile that is $3.50 a square foot that is “still very durable and stylish,” said Emily Carpentieri, the store’s owner. The price per square foot does not include installation. On the higher end is cork or wide-plank wood flooring. These go for $8.25 to $15 a square foot. But vinyl floors in the $5 to $7 range is Suburban Floors’ biggest seller. “These would blow your mind how real they looked,” said Emily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LABOR AND INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction labor can change depending upon your Westchester zip code. The costs are less expensive the further you are from NYC. For Peekskill, labor costs are 22 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr.com</a>. Dobbs Ferry comes in at 40 percent higher and Croton-on-Hudson at 27 percent higher than the national average. The kitchen renovation cost in Rye could have a labor budget 55 percent above the national average. To compare, the labor cost for a kitchen renovation on the Upper East Side is 77 percent higher than the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t forget installation for appliances, cabinetry, plumbing, and electrical. These typically take about 17 percent of a budget, which is about $3,500 for an average kitchen. And as mentioned above, factor in $500 to $1,000 for appliance installation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, renovations are like fingerprints<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no two are alike. That includes their budgets. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator in Westchester allocated their $56,620 renovation budget:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22777 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg" alt="Modern kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel and Eric&#8217;s kitchen</a> in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine cooking in your new kitchen for the first time&#8230;the style! The smart layout! The shiny new appliances and lovely lighting! The team at Sweeten is inspired daily by our clients’ posts describing their renovation dreams, and the best place to start the process is with a realistic budget. Sweeten&#8217;s guide will help you learn what to expect for kitchen renovation costs.</p>
<h3>Average kitchen renovation costs in the U.S.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The national average for a basic kitchen renovation is <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$22,000</a> and swings up to about $60,000 for a major overhaul. What if your desires exceed your bank account? Tweaking the budget so your project comes within your price range while maintaining quality begins with understanding the cost breakdown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen design costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association&#8217;s (NKBA) estimates design fees will comprise about four percent of your budget. Although this percentage could grow. For example, a kitchen designer in NYC might cost 15 percent of that budget, says <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, a Sweeten designer. The NKBA also found that only 22 percent of homeowners renovating a kitchen or a bathroom actually hired a designer. Instead, many chose to work closely with an experienced general contractor on their design to bring down the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just remember that your design will play a big role in the end budget. If you’re dreaming of a layout change that involves moving load-bearing walls and gas lines, take into account the additional paperwork, inspections, and fees later on.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Appliances</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The more you value your cooking skills, the sooner you should make your budget decisions in this category. “If the client falls in love with a 48-inch range, the designer can fit that into the design,” explains Jace Kieffer from <a href="https://www.kieffers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kieffer’s Appliances</a> in Lansdale, PA. Your appliance and ventilation choices may impact the design, he adds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a starter home, a basic four-appliance kitchen set—range, fridge, microwave and dishwasher—costs around $2,000. However, if you’re renovating a kitchen, it’s likely you will want to upgrade to at least premium economy appliances. They cost between $4,000 and $5,000 and have a life expectancy of about seven years. Luxury brands will set you back at least $12,000, a cost that should be weighed against their 15-year life expectancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Across the country, you’re unlikely to see much variation in the cost of luxury appliances. That’s because manufacturers often put minimum price restrictions on their appliances (sorry, no Black Friday deals here). If you’re happy with a lower grade, it might be worth shopping around for a sweeter price.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Ventilation</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like appliances, it is helpful to factor ventilation into the plans early. A basic over-the-range hood that leaves room for the microwave goes for around $300. A standalone hood from a premium economy brand costs $500 or more. A luxury brand might set you back about $2,000. Customs hoods from a metal fabricator can cost upwards of $10,000, Jace said. You also need to plan for ducting, which a general contractor usually takes care of.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Cabinets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest investment of your kitchen renovation will likely be cabinetry and hardware (such as handles and knobs)&#8211;this category typically makes up about 30 percent of budgets. A big factor in pricing will be your preference for custom or pre-fabricated cabinets from stores like Home Depot and IKEA. Stock cabinets average out at about $130 for a linear foot. For a custom job, the price might be as much as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear foot</a>. Custom cabinets will give you greater freedom when deciding your kitchen layout and finished look. It could also get you <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a>. Don’t forget that these cabinets must be installed and that will likely be an additional cost. See more on labor and installation below.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an area where you can scrimp or splurge, depending on your priorities. Countertops can start at $5 per square foot for a butcher’s block or laminate, a synthetic material. A low-end quartz could cost about $50 a square foot and a marble around $60 a square foot. Something more pricey such as granite could cost as much as $100 a square foot. Don’t forget to factor in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backsplash</a>, which is the wall area between the countertop and cabinets. That could range from $3 a square foot to $35.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Floors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Flooring will represent 7 percent of an average budget, or about $1,400, according to the NKBA. Concrete or vinyl flooring are economical choices and can look cool along with being easy to clean. Stone or wood flooring are higher-end options. Keep in mind that new base cabinets that are a different depth than your original may expose old and mismatched flooring.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lighting in the kitchen</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is generally a lower-spend category. In a $20,000 budget, lighting materials usually come in at about $800. Again, this will move up or down depending on your tastes. Besides ventilation, those remodeling their kitchens spent the least on lighting, according to the NKBA.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen plumbing costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like everything else in renovating, your vision and choices will have a big impact on kitchen plumbing costs. On an average remodel, plumbing materials will match lighting expenses at about $800. If you’re considering that layout change then plumbing and gas lines may have to move. That will lead to the added costs in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting and inspections.</p>
<h3><b>Kitchen remodel labor and installation costs</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Preparing the renovation site—leveling tilted floors, replacing the sheetrock, etc.—can cost a few thousand dollars. Add to that installation of appliances and cabinetry, plumbing and electrical, which could take about 17 percent of your total budget or almost $3,500 on an average kitchen renovation. It’s worth pointing out that labor costs can change based on geography. New York City is the most expensive. Chicago’s labor costs are on average about 18 percent cheaper, according to RSMeans data. Philadelphia is a few percentage points lower at about 21 percent and LA sits at more than 30 percent lower than New York. And check with your contractor if their fees cover permits. If not, that could add another $1,000 or two.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Resale Value</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Setting a budget can be overwhelming with the cost of all these separate items. The good news is renovations are an investment. For example, a $62,000 investment in a kitchen <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could see</a> a $40,000 increase in resale value on the home, according to Remodeling Magazine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, that also increases the value of your property for taxation purposes. In Philadelphia, home improvements can get a <a href="https://www.biaofphiladelphia.com/tax-abatement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax abatement</a>. The value your new kitchen adds to your home will not be taxed for 10 years, said Marianne Scott from the Building Industry Association of Philadelphia. Similar programs exist in many other cities such as Pittsburgh and <a href="https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/community-development/housing-assistance/residential-property-tax-abatement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cincinnati</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, no two renovations and their budgets are the same. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator allocated their $25,000 kitchen renovation budget:</p>

			<h2>Combining apartments in NYC? First, brush up on the costs, considerations, and requirements</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you do when you need more room? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can head for the suburbs, search for a larger apartment elsewhere, or if you’re lucky, scoop up an adjacent apartment and hold onto everything you love about your current neighborhood. Another popular approach is combining apartments which entail a search in areas with large inventories of smaller apartments. Below, w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e outline how to combine apartments in NYC, pros and cons of this process, and take an in-depth look at budgeting. You can also read examples of homeowners who’ve been through the process with their <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors.</span><br />

<h3>The pros and cons of combining apartments in NYC</h3>
<h4><b>Reasons to combine New York City apartments</b></h4>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You stay in the same building and neighborhood, with access to all the same amenities, schools, services, and parks you love.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be more cost-effective (though still expensive) to buy an additional smaller unit and pay for a renovation than to buy a new, larger unit.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re already knowledgeable about the building. And if you’re on good terms with your board and superintendent, it may be easier to arrange the bureaucratic and logistical intricacies of a renovation than if you’re the new kid on the block.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re on good terms with your neighbors who will stay good neighbors—even through the construction noise.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be able to avoid broker fees when staying in the same building and buying directly.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Reasons not to combine apartments</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since you’re limited to the immediately adjacent units, the abutting spaces may not be conducive to a smooth flow, depending on layout restrictions. You might end up with awkward hallways or bedrooms off the kitchen.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board might be unhappy to have too high a percentage of ownership concentrated in one person’s hands, and in turn, prove difficult about the approval process.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will take on additional maintenance and taxes, and the combined charges may appear unusually high to potential buyers for resale.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, you will have to pay the carrying costs on both apartments for the duration of the renovation (possibly without being able to live in either!).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose to merge two apartments in a new location, you’ll face the same cons, as well as the need to finance two home purchases.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Should you combine apartments? Ask yourself these questions.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeowners with adjacent apartments have the luxury of multiple layout options, but also need to work within a unique set of constraints to create the new space. In any unit-combining project, you’ll have to consider the following questions:</span></p>
<p><b>Is a combination even possible?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not all buildings allow combinations. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check the building&#8217;s alteration agreement</a> for allowances. And in those that do, before you buy, bring in an architect and/or structural engineer to assess whether your dream can be made a reality. Don’t assume that you can knock down that wall! As one Sweeten contractor points out: “Your ability to probe for structural elements prior to construction can be limited by building requirements and existing tenants, and building records are notorious for omitting elements of the building’s composition, so you have to work with your architect to prepare for unforeseen conditions.” Although there is a limit to what can be deduced without actually starting demolition, a consultation will give you a sense of what you can do and how much it’ll cost.</span></p>
<p><b>Are you combining horizontally or vertically?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Horizontal combinations are typically easier, because it can be as simple as knocking through a non-structural wall to make a door-sized opening and removing one kitchen (NYC code only permits one kitchen per apartment, although certain exceptions can be made).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vertical combinations (duplexes) are more complicated because of structural considerations and the possibility of electrical and plumbing systems hidden in floors. And don’t forget the staircase! It can take up more space than anticipated and require the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring of a few renovation experts</a> (architect, structural engineer, contractor, millworker) to design, approve, fabricate, and install.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten homeowners, Zoe and Arvid,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> completed a horizontal combination in Lincoln Square. Their scope included removing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the two existing kitchens, ripping out old parquet-glued-to-concrete floors, and taking down internal walls to create a third bedroom.</span></p>

<p><b>Can you use the space intelligently and create an overall flow?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Buildings often limit where you can move baths and kitchens with “no wet-over-dry” rules, preferring that wet rooms remain stacked on top of each other from floor to floor (to curtail damage from any potential leaks and preserve plumbing lines). If that’s the case, you may not get be able to rethink the layout. That said, it’s certainly not impossible. One </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-apartment-combination-with-a-view/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten renovator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Upper West Side expanded his bathroom by taking space from a nearby closet. Wiring did have to be moved, but he was able to complete and get the project approved accordingly.</span></p>

<p><strong>How</strong><b> will you merge the heating and cooling systems? </b>Especially in older buildings, units may not share the same type of systems. You may consider installing an entirely new system across the new space.</p>
<p><b>Are the apartments in similar condition, and are the floors and ceilings level? </b>If the two units were updated at different times, they might not share the same flooring, trim, moldings, doors, or hardware. Apartments in older buildings are sometimes unleveled. Many creative solutions are available, such as sunken living rooms or coffered ceilings, but it’s best to consult an architect on what will work best in your space.</p>

<h3>Combining Apartments in NYC: Building and City Requirements</h3>
<p>A renovation is always a learning process, and doubly so when it’s an apartment combination project. You’re typically allowed to merge units in either co-ops or condos, but different approvals and filings are associated with each. In both, however, you’ll have to deal with requirements from the building as well as the city.</p>
<h4>Building requirements for combining apartments</h4>
<p>Get in touch with management to make sure that you have a comprehensive list of all the building requirements. Most buildings will also require architectural plans first to be submitted to the board for approval. Some will have template alteration agreements in place, which can be adapted to your specific project. These will have details about permissible work hours, protection of common areas, whether there are “wet-over-dry” rules, as well as information about the costs associated with approvals, security deposits, and other building fees.</p>
<h4>City requirements for combining apartments</h4>
<p>A myriad of codes govern apartment combinations, and New York City has put together <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/code_notes_combining_apt.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resources to guide homeowners through the process</a>. Still, you’ll probably want to hire an expediter to help you navigate the process. Unlike simpler renovations, joining units will most certainly require permits from the Department of Buildings (DoB). For example, you’ll need an ALT2 (Alteration Type 2) application for a permit to remove a kitchen, which involves cutting and capping all gas and electrical lines. For condos, you will also need to merge the tax lots on the two properties by filing an amendment to the condo declaration and offering a plan with the Department of Finance (DoF).</p>
<p>A final note on approvals: homeowners tell us hold-ups usually occur in the building approval process, rather than with the city. This is because boards can make decisions “as they see fit,” leading to inexplicable delays, whereas the city permits process is well-regulated and navigable by an experienced professional, such as an expediter.<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3>What to Expect When Combining Apartments</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the various moving parts of an apartment combination, allow for extra time and budget.  Give yourself a few months of wiggle room—if your general contractor says that the project will take six months, plan for it to take eight or nine. Your contractor should be able to tell you at the outset of your project whether it would be advisable or possible for you to stay put. If you need to relocate, rent space nearby for at least that amount of time so that you’ll have a debris-free home that’s close enough to the construction site for frequent check-ins.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the process, just remember the prize: a beautiful, sprawling apartment customized just for you and your family to enjoy for years to come.</span></p>
<h3>Costs for Combining Apartments in NYC</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with other renovation projects, understanding the scope of your project is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first step to creating a budget</a>. While apartment combination projects usually run in the six figures, let’s start with a baseline scenario for a </span><b>horizontal combination</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for budgeting purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These numbers should be considered a minimum; most combinations will cost more.  If your project is a vertical one, there will be significant additional costs due to the necessity of a structural engineer and relevant permits. A vertical scope would be outside the baseline scenario outlined below.</span></p>
<p><strong>1.)</strong><b> Initial consultation<br />
</b>You walk through the space with a pro, who will tell you whether a combination is possible and/or advisable. This will take about two to five hours, including a follow-up consultation.</p>
<p><b>Who’s involved: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Architect and/or structural engineer<br />
</span><b>Estimated cost: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect to pay for any renderings or designer work they do (see costs below)</span></p>
<p><strong>2.) </strong><b> Architectural drawings and schematic design<br />
</b>An architect will draw up renderings, which will be used to obtain building and city approvals. If you hire an interior designer to draw them, they’ll need to be stamped by a registered architect to be approved through a board and the DOB.</p>
<p><b>Who’s involved:</b> Architect and/or interior designer<br />
<b>Estimated cost:</b> $500-$1,500, approximately 10% of the architect’s fee</p>
<p><b>3.) Architect’s fee<br />
</b>Includes field measuring, schematic design, project management (including the work of filing and building/city approvals), and periodic on-site check-ins to make sure all is going to plan. overseeing the project from start to finish.</p>
<p><b>Who’s involved: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Architect<br />
</span><b>Estimated cost:</b> Typically 10-20% of the total project cost</p>
<p><b>4.) Building approvals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building boards will often ask for fees upfront to pay their experts to review the plans, and for security deposits, shut-off fees, general construction charges, and penalty fees.</span></p>
<p><b>Who’s involved: </b>An architect<br />
<b>Estimated costs: </b>Dependant on the percentage of the project and individual building requirements. This is something homeowners can handle themselves to help cut costs.</p>
<p><b>5.) City permits and requirements<br />
</b>You’ll need to meet various requirements and obtain relevant permits. An expediter will speed up the process.</p>
<p><b>Who’s involved:</b> Architect, expediter, or project manager<br />
<b>Estimated costs:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Asbestos inspection: $500</li>
<li>Plumbing permit: up to $2,000</li>
<li>Electrical permit: $900</li>
<li>ALT2 permit: dependant on the size of the project; a few hundred to a few thousand dollars</li>
<li>Expediter: $3,500 per project</li>
<li>Filing/recording fees: $3,000-$5,000</li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><b>6.) Monthly carrying costs</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll have to pay the taxes and common charges on both apartments while the renovation is ongoing. Allot time not just for the actual construction, but also obtaining permits and approvals.</span></p>
<p><b>Estimated costs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sums of carrying costs of each apartment</span></p>
<p><b>7.) Labor/contracting work</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working with your general contractor</a>, their role is similar to other renovations: basic prep work, demolition, plumbing and electrical, building/installation, clean-up and completion. The contractor will also need to ensure uniformity across spaces by replacing baseboards, molding, hardware, etc.</span></p>
<p><b>Who’s involved: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contractor<br />
</span><b>Estimated costs: </b>$80,000-$100,000</p>
<p><b>8.) Materials</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sourcing paint, doorknobs, hinges, and other finishes</span></p>
<p><b>Who’s involved:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Contractor, architect/designer, or project manager<br />
</span><b>Estimated costs: </b>$100-$1,000</p>
<p><b>9.) Contingency</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always budget for unexpected expenses. This is especially true in renovations where there are structural changes or if you’re removing walls, floors, and ceilings.</span></p>
<p><b>Estimated costs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $1,500-$2,000, or roughly 10-20% of the total project cost</span></p>

<h3>Getting Back What You Put Into an Apartment Combination</h3>
<p>In new developments, sponsors have offered to combine units, while real estate agents marketing combination units will include architectural drawings and other resources needed for such a project. In many neighborhoods, especially those with kid-friendly amenities and good public schools, creating a larger apartment can be a sound financial investment. Each situation is different, however, so be sure to take the following into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it make sense for your family’s needs?</li>
<li>How much are the monthly carrying charges (maintenance and taxes)—will they be affordable for you and for any potential buyers down the line?</li>
<li>Can you obtain financing for the renovation?</li>
<li>For resale purposes, what is the estimated market value of the combined unit, versus the two units separately?</li>
</ul>
