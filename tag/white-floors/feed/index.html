<h3>A couple&#8217;s journey to the ideal railroad-style apartment</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For every homeowner, there are certain household features that just aren’t negotiable: from space layout to square footage and modern features. Some owners are willing to do whatever it takes to make sure their home matches their preferences, which was certainly true for Lavanya and Regis, a couple who had to try (and try again) before finding a space that truly felt like home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They had sold an apartment that she had loved, and proceeded to buy and move into another that they both really disliked. Lavanya, the executive producer for Artifex Productions, a New York City-based production company, decided to give it another try, saying, “We were on the hunt for something like the old place.” </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="lavanya-with-her-dog" class="alignnone wp-image-57478 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-portrait-1.webp" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowner" width="600" height="900" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-portrait-1.webp 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-portrait-1-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The renewed search was for a railroad-style layout with distinct spaces that could serve different purposes for home and business activities. When she and her partner Regis, who manages an NYC-based restaurant, and Frankie, their 11-year-old Jack Russell terrier, saw it, they knew it was the one. They snapped up the railroad apartment and <span class="s2">posted their project</span> to find<span class="s2"> a <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor </span>to help them implement their vision for their unusually shaped home.<i> </i></span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-dining-12.webp" alt="Living and home office space with white floors" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-57472 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-dining-12.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-dining-12-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-dining-12-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-8.webp" alt="White kitchen with white floors" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone wp-image-57476 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-8.webp 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-8-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The railroad apartment, a long-skinny layout, was introduced in New York City in the mid-19th century. The style, also referred to as a “floor-through,” is known for its small, narrow rooms. However, with some help, a railroad apartment can become the perfect layout for a couple with at least one work-at-homer. Lavanya knew from the first apartment she and her husband had that a long, rambling railroad-style flat could be configured to create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-bronx-rowhouse-remodel-for-work-life-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private office for her to work in</a> without feeling like the rest of their home life was overlapping with her space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They found their new apartment in South Park Slope, Brooklyn. The two-bedroom condo was 700 square feet and, as is typical, stretched from the front of the prewar building, built around 1910, to its rear. One thing railroad-style apartments are known for is the immodest “bathtub in the kitchen.” While there was no tub in theirs, the overall layout still didn’t fit the couple’s day-to-day needs, and would still plan to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revamp their apartment&#8217;s flow</a>.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-6.webp" alt="White and wood kitchen" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone wp-image-57474 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-6.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-6-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-6-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="s1"></span></p>
<h3>Planning a railroad apartment renovation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Lavanya and Regis signed their Sweeten contractor, they understood that they would need a six-month renovation to cover work across multiple rooms. To begin with, the railroad-style condo was strangely configured: the primary bedroom was at the apartment’s back end, far from the bathroom, and next to it was the dining area, which, as the former owners had it arranged, was separated from the living area by the kitchen. To the couple, the apartment’s arrangement felt backward. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">To help the couple, their contractor recommended Jennifer Levy of <a href="https://www.cavdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAVdesign Interiors</a> to make sense of the space they were working with and create the right flow that would work for them. </span><span class="s1">The team decided to <span class="s2">flip the layout</span> so that the area that had been the living room would become their bedroom. The rear bedroom, which was large, would become a living area and office. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bedroom-11.webp" alt="Bedroom after the renovation" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone wp-image-57468 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bedroom-11.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bedroom-11-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bedroom-11-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="s1">[P]ocket and barn doors&#8230;saved a ton of space and made our whole home feel modern and cool.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We needed to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fix the kitchen</a> which had issues including old, honey-colored wood cabinets and a layout that was far from its efficient capacity. The floors throughout the apartment were uneven and stained a reddish color which felt outdated. Their goal was to make the main rooms bright and airy by integrating glossy white-painted wood floors, built-in storage, and recessed lighting on dimmers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next up was <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redesigning the bathroom</a>. The tub had been shoved into a corner and closed off by an unattractive partial wall, creating a very narrow and dark opening. The toilet and sink were installed too close together and the bathroom had minimal storage. Ultimately, the duo wanted to reconfigure the room to create a more spacious, spa-like environment. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57466 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bathroom-9.webp" alt="Bathroom remodel with wooden cabinets" width="600" height="900" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bathroom-9.webp 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bathroom-9-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3>Kicking off the work with a Sweeten expert</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their Sweeten contractor installed solid oak wood floors and painted the planks with high-performance floor paint. They ran into challenges while updating the lighting when the electricians realized that installing the dimmable lighting would require replacing the wiring to bring it to code. This ended up creating many new holes in the walls, which then needed to be patched and skim coated putting the project behind schedule. One bright consolation was the brand-new dimmer switches—one of their favorite features.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen was a success</a> without many problems to solve. The contractor suggested hiding the refrigerator, freezer, and dishwasher behind panels that matched the cabinetry. The room was spacious enough that their new <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">washer and dryer</span></a> found their place behind a closet without conflict. The finishing touches included handmade tiles for the backsplash and a custom butcher-block counter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-closet-2.webp" alt="The entryway to the apartment" width="601" height="900" class="alignnone wp-image-57470 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-closet-2.webp 601w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-closet-2-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lavanya was especially excited about the closets custom-designed for the bedrooms, with sliding shoe racks to accommodate her self-professed “footwear addiction.” That organizational theme continued on many of the interior thresholds with pocket and barn doors; this idea, which their contractor embraced, saved significant space and made their whole home feel modern and stylish.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom planning process</a> was a collaboration between Lavanya and Regis who enjoyed both the creativity and end result. They opted for a hand-poured concrete floor and custom cabinets, along with luxurious hand-made tiles for the shower and a deep, cast-iron soaking bathtub (a non-negotiable for the couple.) New shower fixtures, including a rain showerhead, a towel heater, and a dimmable backlit mirror pulled it all together. </span></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-sliding_door-3.webp" alt="Roller top barn door" width="601" height="900" class="alignnone wp-image-57479 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-sliding_door-3.webp 601w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-sliding_door-3-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" />An in-sync partnership produces great results</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every step of the way, their Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor was fantastic</a>: “Relaxed and professional from the outset, he <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped me stay calm</a>, even when delays and surprise expenses came up. The electricians and plumbers were exceptional as well,” said Lavanya. During the renovation, their contractor came up with ideas to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep costs at the right place</a> and also substituted some expensive ideas with affordable ones.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We love our gleaming floors and the brightness of the rooms, and our beautiful, modern bathroom. It’s like we live in a white palace!” Lavanya shared. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you, Lavanya and Regis, for sharing your space with us!</i></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An awkward space turns sanctuary with a few simple ideas</h2>
<p>When a long apartment search finally ended, Victoria’s Secret designer Christine Yao returned to one of the first listings already crossed off her list. It was the one she ultimately closed on, and she was happy with her new home—except for her bathroom which felt like showering in a dark closet. An internet search led her to Sweeten and a match with a general contractor, who would help transform the space to echo the layout and feel of the baths she&#8217;d been pinning on Pinterest for months. With smart space reconfigurations (including a vintage sliding door) and good project management, he made it happen. In her own words, Christine tells the story, from how the thought of renovating scared her to the completion of her relaxing new dwelling.</p>

<p><em>Guest post by East Village homeowner Christine Yao</em></p>
<p>I had been living on the Lower East Side for about five years when I started looking for a place to own. My weekends became a routine, waking up and planning errands around my StreetEasy open house schedule and any listings my real estate agent sent me. The beginning was packed, usually a few on Saturday and also Sundays when I walked all over downtown and viewed up to six apartments. You quickly realize that when you are focused on staying in a specific area—for me that was roughly LES/Chinatown/East Village—there are a limited number of places to see. At first, it seemed like there were hundreds of apartments for sale, and maybe 50 you can afford. You feel like half of the 50 may not even be worth seeing from the photos but you go see them anyway. A friend who had gone through the home-buying process made a comparison to online dating—one can only tell so much from the photos, you just have to go and see it in person to really know! A few months in, I had lost out on two places, and felt a little hopeless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #a69f3d;"><em><strong>&#8220;No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?&#8221;</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, finally, six months after I started looking, I had an accepted offer and closed on a co-op in the East Village. I had actually seen this apartment at the very beginnings of my search. My brother was in town on a Sunday when I dragged him from one open house to another. We thought the apartment was in an awesome location, and was a nice size. It needed some cosmetic work, but both agreed the bathroom was terrible. It had a wall right in the middle of it with the bathtub half concealed, so it felt like you were showering in a dark closet. It was cramped, with an awkward layout, and was just in bad shape. So I crossed it off the list. The idea of a bathroom renovation was overwhelming to me, on top of buying my first home. Then six months of searching made me re-think—maybe I could. No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?</p>

<p>So now, I had a bathroom to renovate, a living space that needed a refresh, and no idea where to start. The internet brought me to Sweeten. I liked how simple and straightforward it made finding a contractor: you <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project</a> and general contractors are matched for your job. I decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>—his work was most similar to the aesthetic I was going for and he had completed a project on Sweeten with a great review.</p>
<p>My plan for the entire apartment’s look was minimalist. I love a clean space that still feels warm and cozy. Greek cave hotels and Moroccan riads are a big inspiration for me. I did have a vision of wanting the apartment to feel like a vacation&#8230;somewhere tropical and feels relaxing when you are there. The kitchen, main living area, and two bedrooms just needed a redesign. But I couldn’t imagine my day-to-day in the previous bathroom—the door opening awkwardly, the dark shower, and not being able to enjoy a bath.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21714" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02 (1)" width="600" height="900" /></p>
<p>I was hoping the middle wall obstruction could be partially removed but we wouldn’t know if it was structural until the demo. Turns out the wall had all the building plumbing running through it, so needless to say, it had to stay. However, we found serious leaks happening on the floors above and below me (I am on the third floor of a five-story building), which the building would have to fix before we could move forward. Since pipes had to be replaced, the plumbing could be re-routed, allowing us to swap tub and toilet positioning. This worked out for the best: the toilet in a “nook,” and the bathtub by the window.</p>
<p>I had so many images on my desktop saved for ideas and realized they all had the common thread of black tile floors and clean, white walls with modern fixtures. I was getting a lot of inspiration from restaurant and hotel restrooms. I definitely wanted recessed lighting above the toilet (dimmers are a must for all lighting—mood!) and exposed plumbing under the sink for more leg room.</p>
<p>I ended up ordering almost everything on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>, which has phenomenal customer service by the way. I must have looked at hundreds of sinks. We realized it had to be a corner sink or you wouldn’t have enough space to get on and off the toilet. Then the toilet had to be an appropriate size. Measured twice, measure one more time, then cross my fingers when it came in. It all fit into this Tetris game of a bathroom! I wanted a sliding door that would let light through and found an old office door at Big Reuse in Gowanus, Brooklyn. My contractor cut it down to fit the doorway and painted it.</p>

<p>The renovation was running a couple months late due to waiting on permits, so taking things like a toilet and subway tile from Home Depot that were in stock was a priority. My Sweeten contractor was so easy to work with and made things stress-free on everything from dealing with the unexpected delays and permits to coordinating a time to receive a bathtub delivery. I also trusted his aesthetic and opinion on any design or materials questions I had.</p>
<p>As far as the rest of the apartment, it’s amazing what fresh paint and swapping out things like lighting, doorknobs, and some cabinet doors can do. He did a fantastic painting job and the white floors are my favorite feature of my home. My original budget was $25,000 for renovating the bathroom and repainting the apartment. I ended up going $4,500 overbudget because I live in a co-op. The process of getting permits and running into unforeseen issues with plumbing in-between the floors increased the costs and timeline. A six-week planned renovation turned into three months. I think it was really just me underestimating the cost of labor and materials, especially living here in New York City.</p>

<p>The bathroom turned out better than I could have hoped and I am so thankful for the successful renovation I had with my contractor through Sweeten. Now that I’ve experienced the process, the advice I can offer is to be prepared for it to take longer than you think. And add another month. Be prepared to spend a good chunk of time every day on it—coordinating with your contractor, arranging delivery times, looking for fixtures, going to check on things, etc. Be ready to laugh when things go wrong. And go wrong again. It’ll be worth it when you are enjoying your renovated place, I promise.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot about the kitchen—with all of my budget going to the bathroom and painting, I just took down the cabinet doors myself and painted. That’s a move I’ve done in many apartments I’ve lived in as a renter. It’s functional for now but I can’t wait to renovate this space next!</p>
<p>Thank you Christine, for sharing your story as a first-time homeowner and renovator! You proved that a few renovating ideas can make a big impact, and we love your fresh style.</p>
