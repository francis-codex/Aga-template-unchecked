			<h2>Whether done in houses or co-ops, kitchen renovations for families make life easier</h2>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you have young children, you realize quickly what does and doesn’t work about the space you’re in. Common issues are a lack of storage or insufficient dining space. Perhaps you need a better flow between rooms. Or, it might be all of the above.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here, three Sweeten renovations show how parents transformed kitchens and bathrooms into spaces that work for their families—adding functionality and, of course, beautiful form to their homes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a></span><span class="s1"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>Borrowed Space Makes the Difference for a Brooklyn Kitchen</h3>

<h4>An inhospitable kitchen</h4>
<p>Betsy, a teacher, and Zach, an executive at a retail company, live in a two-bedroom, two-bath duplex garden apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The couple now has Amina, age 2, and two dogs, Tristen and Archie. Their duplex in a 19th-century brownstone was in decent shape but didn’t quite match their design aesthetic.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><span class="s4">They held off on renovating for a few years, but once Amina was born, they decided to take the plunge and finally renovate to have their home suit their ever-changing needs. They wanted to make the most of their 1,200-square-foot main floor. “</span><span class="s1">We bought knowing we would ultimately like to renovate, but the apartment was pretty updated; it just wasn’t our aesthetic,” said Betsy. “We had been living in the space for nearly three years, and the kitchen was especially difficult.” The refrigerator was apartment-sized and the peninsula-shaped design meant that only one person could be in the space at a time. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">So <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/28307#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Betsy and Zach posted their project</a> on Sweeten to find a general contractor who could help with all of their design challenges and in addition fix the poor lighting in the main living area. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Mixing old with modern elements</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To make more room and utilize the space more efficiently, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Sweeten contractor</a> reduced the size of the hall bathroom to add a bit more space to the tiny kitchen. The floors were converted from a dated yellow to a beautiful hardwood. They added a mix of traditional elements (classic hardwood floors) with a modern aesthetic (flat-panel cabinets). Multiple sources of lighting like a chandelier were installed over the main table as well as high hats to keep the open space bright and airy.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-open-kitchen-with-cabinetry" class="alignnone wp-image-50708 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8.jpg" alt="white open kitchen with cabinetry and dining nook on a hardwood flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-with-closed-cabinetry" class="alignnone wp-image-50707 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-7.jpg" alt="White kitchen closed cabinetry with cooking range and chimney over wooden flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="brown-wooden-pull-out-storage" class="alignnone wp-image-50709 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-pantry-2.jpg" alt="Natural brown wooden pull out storage with for pantry after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-pantry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-pantry-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-pantry-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Our Sweeten contractor was great in every small decision, from the pull-out storage options for utensils to hiding the unsightly microwave in a garage cabinet to making the fridge seamlessly blend into the cabinetry—a big feat considering we now have a 36” french door refrigerator,” said Betsy. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When asked about her advice for renovators, Betsy had this to say: “Be smart about your budget. We went with a quote that was comfortably below our bottom line, and this gave us the flexibility to spend more in certain areas and save in others without constantly being stressed about going over.”</span></p>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Seeking space to grow</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Paul, a collegiate swim coach, and Margaret, a pediatric nurse practitioner, bought their 1,</span><span class="s1">700-square-foot, two-bedroom condo, they knew they wanted to renovate it right away. “We had been living in the Heights neighborhood of Jersey City, but wanted more space for a growing family,” said Paul. “North Bergen’s mix of affordability, family-friendly amenities, and proximity to work appealed to us.” However, to make the house family-friendly, they turned to Sweeten. </span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/50727" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul and Margaret posted their project </a>on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4145" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired a general contractor</a> to renovate their kitchen. “Sweeten was helpful in showing us qualified contractors in our area,” said Paul. “Being New Jersey residents, we valued Sweeten’s referral model.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They wanted a contractor who could take their kitchen into the 21st century, updating their old laminate-and-tile kitchen into a more modern space. They wished for additional counter space as well as storage—common must-haves for a young family. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">A new layout brings high impact results</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-with-granite-countertop" class="alignnone wp-image-50717 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="White kitchen with granite countertop along with double door fridge after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-with-glass-countertop" class="alignnone wp-image-50714 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="White kitchen with glass countertop on a kitchen peninsula after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinetry-with-black-granite" class="alignnone wp-image-50716 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="White kitchen cabinetry with black granite countertop and double hung window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple worked with the firm to give their space a clean, contemporary feel without having to do a major overhaul. They didn’t remove or move any walls but they were able to reconfigure the existing layout to work better for their family. They extended the countertop and added cabinetry for additional storage. Plus, they included a nod to New York by way of a simple subway tile backsplash. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Our contractor was helpful in keeping the project moving despite material delays and the start of the pandemic,” said Paul. These first-time renovators could not be happier with their now user-friendly new kitchen. </span></p>

<h4>Reduce clutter, expand livable space</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A 1925 side-hall colonial was in need of a remodel for homeowners Jennifer and Sauyee. They made plans to live in the 1,740-square-foot home in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, for a few years before embarking on a renovation. With two small children, they wanted to make sure when they did decide to renovate that they could pinpoint exactly what was needed to make their busy lives more convenient and comfortable.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The layout lacked usable counter space and had way too many countertop appliances to be functional. Plus, the flow from the kitchen to the rest of the house needed to be reconsidered to make it more family-friendly. They also desperately wanted more usable space and a lighter, brighter vibe. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The finished product is a more modern, usable space—one that reflects the couple’s personality and everyday needs. The pantry unit is perfect for the kids’ snacks as well as additional storage for their kitchen essentials. And even though it is not as obvious as some of the other aesthetic details, the homeowners are equally appreciative of the properly vented range hood. As a family of four, cooking is very important and any cook knows a bad vent hood can be a real nuisance. So, it was an upgrade they really wanted. They chose gray Shaker cabinets, light quartz countertops, and redid the hardwood floors throughout to make a cohesive design statement.</span></p>

<p class="p1">In addition, they decided to also remodel the bathroom since the kitchen was getting a facelift. They went with a gray color palette: <span class="s5">light, marble-style tile for the floor and shower wall, with an accent dark, geometric shower floor. But t</span><span class="s1">heir favorite part? The heated floors—appreciated by the kids and adults alike. </span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: After a few years of renting in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Natalia and Daniel were ready to buy a place of their own. They found a two-bedroom co-op with a great location (across the street from Fort Greene Park!), knowing a renovation would be necessary to make the 1950s space feel like home. The to-be remodelers (who were also expecting their first child!) wanted to take advantage of the large windows and natural light, and better connect the dark and tight galley kitchen to the rest of the living space. The TV producer and creative director </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/33798" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sweeten and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4894" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Important, though not visible changes, like updating the electrical wiring, became a high priority. “It’s actually a huge peace-of-mind knowing that the air-conditioning won’t short-circuit the dishwasher,” Daniel shared. From there, they skim-coated the walls and ceilings across the apartment to smooth out years of bad paint jobs and patchwork. The floors were also spruced up, sanded down, and refinished to look brand new.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renovators decided to extend the counter space into the dining area as a serving surface. It also helps join the rooms. Since the galley-style cooking space was tight, the couple chose a slim refrigerator and narrow base cabinets on one side to improve flow.</span></p>

Not only was the couple paying rent and a mortgage simultaneously, but they also had a baby on the way! Their contractor and his team worked hard to meet their chosen deadline and helped the first-time renovators navigate the process from start to finish. “He also was able to fill in the gaps on the small things you don&#8217;t think about as a first-time renovator, like the right ways to get the wood and tile floors to meet in the kitchen. He often provided those materials himself, or ordered them for us,” Daniel shared. </span></p>

But honestly, the biggest help is just at the beginning—finding a reliable contractor with good reviews. It sounds simple, but it isn&#8217;t,” Daniel said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>She decided to renovate instead of move</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>With prices in her Fort Greene co-op building surging upward, film editor Mollie Goldstein faced a dilemma: she could cash out (but deal with the colossal hassle of moving) or remain in a building and neighborhood she loved (albeit in an outdated “starter” studio apartment). Some smart home equity math helped her see that the pros of her current place outweighed the cons, so she came to Sweeten to upgrade (inventively and colorfully!) rather than start again elsewhere.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by Fort Greene homeowner Mollie Goldstein</em></p>
<p>About a year ago, I started noticing that prices for apartments in my Fort Greene co-op building had skyrocketed. I live in a studio, so the question of upgrading to a true one-bedroom was always on my mind. It had also been ten years since I bought my 500 square foot “starter apartment,” so I was starting to wonder if it might be time for a more “grown-up” dwelling. In short: Was now the time to cash out and buy something bigger elsewhere?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon consideration, though, I realized that 1) I love my building, 2) I love my neighborhood, and 3) my apartment is the exact right size for one person and one dog. The increasing market value, however, meant that I had equity I could borrow against, and so I decided to renovate the kitchen and bathroom and make myself a new apartment without having to uproot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39988 size-full" title="kitchen before renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39989 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom before renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04.jpg" alt="bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That decision turned out to be the easy part. When it came to planning a renovation—or even finding someone to help me plan a renovation—I had no idea what I was doing and no clue how to get started. After some time on the Internet, I thought a design/build firm might make the most sense for me, since I had no confidence in my ability to either design a proper space or supervise a contractor. But when I talked to the reps for several Manhattan firms, they laughed at my budget and sent me packing. Google eventually led me to Sweeten, where I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a>. The kind staff there double-checked my budget, but at least they didn’t laugh—and neither did the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a> I was eventually paired up with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She was amazing, and I felt an instant rapport with her. I’d had no experience in construction, but I do collaborate for a living (I’m a film editor), and I immediately recognized that she was a gem. The design process was so much fun. Because I was renovating in order to stay put, I wanted to design spaces purely for myself. Both rooms had always been serviceable, but the hasty repairs made before I moved in ten years earlier were showing their age, and I knew there had to be better ways to take advantage of the space I had available (especially in the surprisingly large-for-NYC kitchen). It drove me crazy that the kitchen cabinets didn&#8217;t reach the ceiling (so much wasted space!) and I hated stacking my spices on top of the stove. I also had a random hole in my kitchen wall where a neighbor&#8217;s contractor had drilled through and then disappeared. The bathroom was grungy in its off-white color scheme and constantly sprouting various leaks and cracks. I also love pattern and color, and I knew I wanted to create a personalized kitchen and something other than a standard white bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39996 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39994 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39995 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen desk niche" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="kitchen desk niche" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen design came together very quickly. I gave my contractor a few wallpaper swatches and a random list of priorities: I wanted a dishwasher, but it had to be less obtrusive than the current model; I needed a place for cookbooks; I was desperate for more storage; and could she please include a cute little spice drawer? Within a few days she sent me a rendering that was very similar to the final product. The Hygge &amp; West wallpaper (which I’d had my eye on for a while), set the tone for our color scheme and she designed a clever built-in with a hidden-drawer dishwasher by Fisher &amp; Paykel that I loved right away.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The basic layout of the bathroom was pretty easy, too, but we struggled a little more with the design. I knew I wanted something special, but I didn’t exactly know what it was. I sent my contractor a list of tiles I liked, none of which were appropriate, but she looked at them all and distilled the essence of what I was looking for, sending back the chevron marble from TileBar that we eventually went with around the tub (with its hexagon cousin for the floor). And as it happened, one of those other rejected bathroom tiles ended up as the kitchen floor — when we were looking at all our samples together, I slid that Bestile Moderna sample over to the kitchen pile, and, while neither of us had seen it coming, we both loved the black &amp; white pattern against the blue cabinetry. The floor has since become one of my absolute favorite things about the kitchen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to my contactor and her team, construction went pretty smoothly (for me). I moved out for five weeks while they dealt with all the problems of a crumbling kitchen ceiling, hauling debris out through a co-op lobby, and having to send back tile that arrived scratched. I’m sure there were a hundred other stumbling blocks that I never heard about, and I remain deeply grateful for the opportunity to work with trustworthy contractors whose standards were even higher than I expected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Maggie (my dog) and I have moved back in, I’m in love with my new space. Showering in my beautiful marble shower every morning is a treat, and I cook much more—and much more enjoyably—now that I have all the counter space I need. Both the kitchen and the bathroom are neater and less cluttered than ever before now that there is a place to put everything. I’m incredibly happy that I took the renovation plunge.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So many exciting developments have been bubbling up behind the scenes at theSweeten! Among them is a new photo series we’ve been working on with the help of our friend, photographer <a href="https://jeffreykilmer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeffrey Kilmer</a>. Rather than the usual &#8216;before &amp; after,&#8217; we’re taking our site visits up a notch, and including professional shots of the during stages as well. Soon, you&#8217;ll start to see the results of this new series of renovation photos: before, during &amp; after. Until then, here&#8217;s a preview of some of those beautiful, uncensored &#8216;durning&#8217; shots.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Famurat Builders</a> was selected from the matches for this Fort Greene couple&#8217;s renovation. The project is due to wrap up shortly, and we can&#8217;t wait to see the space built out and refinished!</p>

<p>This apartment combination in Hell&#8217;s Kitchen is a collaboration between two tS members &#8212; <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Mikhael Architect</a> is the project architect, and the team at <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1395" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulson Management</a> is carrying out the construction. The project is scheduled to finish up later this summer.  We&#8217;ll be sharing more of the construction progress next month.</p>

<p>And since we don&#8217;t just do home renovations at theSweeten, here&#8217;s a look at a Midtown office remodel that was awarded to <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ecostruct</a>. The before, during, &amp; after will be revealed soon!</p>

<h3>Transforming a plain dirt backyard</h3>
<p>“[W]e essentially had a patch of dirt (blank slate) and wanted to create an area that we could enjoy and use to entertain during the warmer months, aka our own oasis within Brooklyn.” said Vic.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a short-term fencing solution had been put in place between the adjacent yards.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" title="backyard-gutted-renovation"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50607" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/406-Vic-Before-2.jpg" alt="backyard gutted down for renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/406-Vic-Before-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/406-Vic-Before-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/406-Vic-Before-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />

<h3>Creating a Brooklyn oasis for entertaining</h3>
<p>A new retaining wall construction wraps across two edges of the yard. The retaining wall intersecting with the home’s exterior wall grows bamboo plantings to reinforce the 30″ elevation difference between Ally &amp; Vic’s yard and their neighbor’s. Without the new retaining wall in place, the neighbor’s yard would have eroded into Ally’s &amp; Vic’s.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their fieldstone retaining wall is planted with hydrangea, azalea, bamboo, forsythia &amp; irises.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sweeten eliminated the need and hassle of checking and double checking contractor references as well as eliminating the worry of what type of quality work we would be receiving,” said Vic. “We were very comfortable with Sweeten’s vetting process for contractors, which enabled us to focus on what we wanted done,” said Vic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I cannot say enough good things about our Sweeten contractor. They were everything you would hope for out of a contractor. Honest, trustworthy, timely, efficient, communicative, helpful, competitively priced,” he concluded.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many thanks to Ally &amp; Vic for sharing their backyard with us!</span></i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we caught up with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a> who is working on an outdoor project, that he was <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/Full-Duplex-Apartment-Repaint-Brooklyn-NY-looking-for-estimates/406#details">awarded via Sweeten</a>, in Fort Greene. This Brooklyn backyard was definitely ready for a makeover, but when the contractor initially reviewed the project, he also realized that they would have to address the non-glamourous issue of soil erosion. A fence had been put up to separate this yard from the neighbor&#8217;s yard, however with a grade difference of 30 inches the existing construction fell short of a realistic, long-term solution.</p>
<p>In order to secure the boundary, they built a field stone retaining wall and have begun the process of laying down a bluestone patio. In the coming weeks, they will fill the retaining areas with plantings, including hydrangea, azalea, bamboo, forsythia &amp; irises and plant grass seed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday <a href="https://sweeten.com/about">Jean</a>, Becky and I visited <a href="https://www.bklyndesigns.com/">Bklyn Designs</a>, the annual showcase at St. Ann&#8217;s Warehouse for local designers and craftspeople. There were upholsterers, woodworkers, carpet makers, and metalsmiths there, all showing off the beautiful things they produced in their Brooklyn studios.</p>
<p>Two rising furniture-makers with very different sensibilities made a big impression.</p>
<p><a href="https://colleenanderic.com/">Colleen and Eric</a> design lovely, playful home furnishings inspired by far-fetched ideas. Small brass rivets are recessed into the dark wood top of the &#8220;Northstar Table&#8221; like stars in the constellation. If you locate the northstar and press down on it, a secret side drawer slides open. It&#8217;s the perfect place to stash a diary, jewelry, or contraband.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1306/4609972374_d29e761b2b.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC NIGHTSTAR TABLE" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3580/4609972472_cb9653e2ff.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC NIGHTSTAR TABLE DETAIL" /></p>
<p>Colleen and Eric&#8217;s &#8220;Hold on Tight Bookshelf&#8221; takes unlikely inspiration from the image of books toppling sideways off an open shelf. This simple maple shelf is capped at one end and has a brightly-colored, sliding metal stop at the other. The toy-like mechanism is a pretty accent and also a lot of fun. Becky couldn&#8217;t stop playing with the display model and Jean and I finally had to drag her away.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1188/4609972250_b3539e1cfa.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC HOLDONTIGHT" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3538/4609972550_fcf110dd4a.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC HOLDONTIGHT DETAIL" /></p>
<p>Colleen and Eric also make accessories like tote bags and keychains. Their product lines are sure to expand further as they&#8217;re struck by new ideas. It &#8216;ll be fun to see what they&#8217;ve come up with at next year&#8217;s fair.</p>
<p>In contrast, the pieces from Kai-Wei Hsu&#8217;s shop <a href="https://www.kwhfurniture.com/">KWH Furniture</a> take inspiration from the elemental qualities of the woods that they&#8217;re made from. The furniture in the new &#8220;Vice&#8221; line doesn&#8217;t shout out for attention. Each piece has a clear, modern sensibility and yet is so restrained so that it wouldn&#8217;t feel out of a place in a traditional interior.</p>
<p>The elegant &#8220;Bar Cart&#8221; is made from white oak with a cerused finish. The first thing you&#8217;re drawn to is the fine grain and stain of the wood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3587/4609973164_ba67d01791.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART" /></p>
<p>Then, as you lean in closer, you understand the exquisite workmanship of the piece. The outer corners of the frame are held together with wood splices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1404/4609972720_04fb2bdf7e.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART DETAIL 01" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4019/4609973430_5fff0ce9ab.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART DETAIL 02" /></p>
<p>The similarly elegant &#8220;Vanity Table&#8221; is made from black walnut with an oil finish. Its proportions are perfectly balanced. The first think that strikes you is the sumptuous finish in the wood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1317/4609363631_a18322cabf.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY" /></p>
<p>Then when you move in closer, as you&#8217;re bound to do, you see how subtly and precisely the drawers are fitted.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1274/4609363865_1d49899a26.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY DETAIL 03" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3332/4609363461_74f96200a4.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY DETAIL 02" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how Kai-Wei&#8217;s designs evolve as he explores new materials and details. Whatever direction the pieces take, I&#8217;m certain they&#8217;ll all have the same immaculate craftsmanship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This apartment would benefit from a soft, bright palette of materials to  keep the rooms, which receive most of their light from the back  windows, light and airy.</p>
<p>I would start by painting the walls and ceiling in an off-white color and installing a durable, light-colored flooring material throughout.  Maple and bamboo are both good choices.  With a natural stain and light varnish the fine grain of these woods shows through and they&#8217;re easy to clean.  A simple wood base of the same material wood will give the walls a neat finish.  The new wood doors, door frames, and window frames would be finished to match.  For the kitchen I&#8217;d use cork floor tiles, which are soft to stand and work on, modern maple cabinets, and dark countertops.  For the bathroom I&#8217;d stick to traditional white ceramic fixtures, and use black and white ceramic tiles on the wainscot and floor.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1133" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="174" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540-300x97.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>A cream- and honey-colored palette for furniture complements the wood flooring and also adds warmth.  Contemporary pieces that stand up off the floor keep things feeling light and airy. I&#8217;d mix in a few more substantial pieces too, perhaps a coffee table from reclaimed wood, or an old-fashioned upholstered sofa.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1131" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="273" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02-300x152.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>Full-height sheer white curtains along the back wall will provide privacy while letting in lots of light.  I&#8217;d use simple bulb-shaped ceiling mounted light fixtures, and hang a special, more ornamental one above the main living or dining area.  Darker colored wool rugs or sisal mats can soften the living areas and pull seating arrangements together.  Brightly colored pillows, wall hangings and throws will add depth and cheer to the rooms.  Red, orange and brown would all be strong accent colors.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1129" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="343" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540-300x191.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>This apartment is going to make a stylish, comfortable  home for someone.  I can&#8217;t wait for her to come in and start sweetening!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1102 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>Since none of the finishes or fixtures in the apartment are worth saving and the layout is somewhat awkward, without a real kitchen or closet space, the best strategy is to gut the interior and begin with a clean slate</p>
<p>The apartment would benefit most from a more open layout, to bring light from the rear windows deeper into the interior.   In addition there are some practical considerations.  There&#8217;s the need for a real kitchen, with adequate counter space and storage. There&#8217;s the need for closet and storage space.  And it&#8217;s best to keep the kitchen and bathroom located where they are, close to the existing plumbing, gas and sewage lines.</p>
<p>The design can go in many different directions, depending on the owner&#8217;s lifestyle and priorities.  Here are some basic ideas:</p>
<p>FOR AN ENTREPENEUR</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1108 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone with her own business, or who sometimes works from home, this scheme builds an 8&#8242;-0&#8243; long work station along the right side of the apartment.  It has a continuous wood work counter, drawers and file cabinets below, and shelving on the wall above.  From here the owner can sit and work without distractions.  When she&#8217;s done, she can clear her things from the counter and the space stays tidy and well-organized, separate from rest of the apartment.</p>
<p>The entire apartment remains open.  At the back is the living and dining area.  At the middle is a bed and a clothing closet.  At the front, near the entry, are a galley kitchen, the bathroom, and linen and coat closets</p>
<p>FOR A FASHIONISTA</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1107 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone who cares deeply about fashion, this scheme has a walk in closet with plenty of room for her to keep her clothing and a place where she can get dressed in the morning.  The closet has racks for garments and shelving for shoes, bags and accessories.  There&#8217;s a window for natural light, and room for a chair and a vanity table or standing mirror too.</p>
<p>The remaining space in back becomes a sleeping alcove. The center of the apartment becomes a living area, with built in bookshelves and cabinets.  At the front, near the entry, are a galley kitchen, the bathroom, and linen and coat closets</p>
<p>FOR A GOURMET</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1109 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone who likes to  cook and entertain, this scheme has a full-size kitchen and a formal dining room.  The double galley kitchen provides plenty of counter and storage space, and room for two or three people to be cooking and prepping at one time.  The dining room is large enough to seat six or eight people.</p>
<p>The back becomes a living area with a fold-out bed.  At the front, near the entry, are the bathroom, a clothes closet and a linen closet.</p>
<p>Any of these layouts could be converted to a proper one-bedroom  by closing off the sleeping area.  This is something that&#8217;s possible but that I would try to work around.  Closing off a bedroom might make the rooms, especially those near the entrance, feel small and dark.</p>
<p>This apartment has a footprint that lends itself to many different layouts.  I&#8217;m very excited to see what choices the owner will make as she sweetens the space!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Here&#8217;s a space that needs some sweetening.</h3>
<p>This one bedroom prewar apartment is on Clinton Avenue in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The building is located brilliantly, on a lovely residential block close to the subway station, shops and restaurants.  The apartment is on the second floor and faces a quiet rear courtyard, with three large windows that let in lots of light.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1092 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has been unoccupied for many years and looks as if it hasn&#8217;t been remodeled in about forty years.  It has its original wood floors, crown and base moldings, and window trim, although they&#8217;re in poor condition.  The building has masonry walls and a hot water heating system with cast iron radiators.  The original wood windows have been replaced with insulated aluminum windows.</p>

<p>The bathroom is roomy but has an awkward layout. The fixtures, wall tile, and floor tile all need to be replaced, and there&#8217;s a gaping hole in the ceiling.</p>

<p>The apartment has no real kitchen, just a freestanding stove and sink near the entry.  The plastic laminate cabinets are in bad shape and there are no counters.  The refrigerator is currently in the living room.</p>

<p>It would be easy to look at this apartment and turn away.  The floors, walls and ceilings all need to be repaired and refinished.  It has no closets or built in cabinets.  The small side windows look out onto  light wells.</p>
<p>But a closer look at the plan reveals that it&#8217;s actually quite wide, 14 feet, which allows for some flexibility in the layout.  It would be possible to reconfigure the kitchen and bathroom so that they&#8217;re more accommodating and more functional.  The windows at the rear of the apartment are quite large.  They bring in a lot of light and overlook a quiet space.  The entire layout could be opened up to bring more light from the back windows into the center of the apartment.</p>
<p>This apartment is in a great location and has a generous footprint.  It would benefit a great deal from just a little bit of sweetening!</p>
