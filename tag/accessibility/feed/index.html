<h3>What is aging in place design? What does accessible design mean?</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To some, &#8220;<strong>aging in place&#8221;</strong> is a design term that means creating living spaces that are safe and accessible for people who want to stay in their homes and care for themselves as they grow older. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To others, the term <strong>&#8220;accessible design&#8221;</strong> or &#8220;living in place&#8221; is more applicable, as it means designing spaces that suit the needs of children and adults in one home. In both cases, the goal is to create living spaces that are, safe, accessible, and also make design sense.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> gives an overview of aging in place design costs, plus costs for accessible designs, and gives tips for when these designs can be beneficial to the family lifestyle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much does accessible design cost?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When part of a major renovation, the cost to include accessible techniques can be minor. &#8220;Things don&#8217;t necessarily need to cost more, they are just different,&#8221; said </span><span class="s3">Julie Schuster of <a href="https://www.jlsdesignstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julie Schuster Design Studio</a></span><span class="s1"> and is a certified living in place professional (CLIPP). &#8220;If you are remodeling a kitchen you probably want under cabinet lighting. Why not upgrade slightly to add bright LED lights that are good for aging eyes?&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are two approaches to accessible living spaces: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Remodel to suit the urgent needs of the homeowner. </b> A wheelchair user will need, among other things, wide doorways and hallways, and a curbless shower with a bench and grab bars. A family with young children may want night lights in the hallways, non-slip bathroom floor tiles, and anti-scald shower valves.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Remodel to make the design flexible for future improvements.</b> &#8220;It is important to learn the things that could crop up in the future and then design backward for them. I install blocking behind a shower wall while renovating, so grab bars or a built-in bench can be added later. Putting in the blocking does not add to the overall cost,&#8221; said Kammi Reiss of <a href="https://www.kammireissdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s4">Kammi Reiss Design</span></a>.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4914#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s4">Sweeten contractor Aaro</span>n</a>, being flexible in design is key. In one condo project, they placed a removable panel in front of the kitchen sink so a wheelchair user can roll up to the sink for use. </span></p>
<h3>What does aging in place cost?</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While many accessible design techniques have similar costs as any renovation project,  some projects do have an increased cost. For example, the combination of slippery surfaces and a wet setting in bathrooms often cause accidents, especially for people with mobility issues or poor eyesight. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here&#8217;s a comparison from the <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 Cost vs. Value Report</a> that compares a standard  5-foot by 7-foot bathroom of mid-range quality to an accessible one of the same size. The accessible bathroom includes 36-inch-wide doors, flat panel electric switches installed at sitting level, walk-in curbless shower with fold-out seat, adjustable shower head, thermostatic mixing valve, LED lighting, ceramic tile walls with contrasting color stripes, towel bars (grab bars) that can support 250 pounds each, night lights, and reconfigured storage accessible to someone in a seated position, among other items.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s an example of what universal design can recoup at resale at a national level.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Costs $24,424 recouping 60% at resale</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Standard universal design remodel: Costs $38,813 recouping 58% at resale</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;<i>Remodeling</i> asked us to revise the remodeling project for them,&#8221; said Louie Delaware, co-founder of the <a href="https://www.livinginplace.institute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Living in Place Institute</span></a>. &#8220;Everyone assumed that it would cost much more and would not be worth as much.&#8221;  While there are increased costs, the return on investment is similar to that of the accessible bathroom. </span></p>
<h3>Costs for accessible design projects:</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are some estimated costs for common projects often associated with accessible designs:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Entrance ramp: $1,300 to $ 3,500<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Door widening to accommodate wheelchairs: $400 to $800, each<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Chair lift: $3,000 to $6,000, curved stairs will cost more<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Widening hallways (often includes moving plumbing, heating and cooling and electrical lines):  $500 to $2,000<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Grab bars with decorative finishes: $100 to $200, each<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Curbless showers: $2,000 to $8,000<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Faucets with lever controls: $200 to $400<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many of the techniques used in accessible design or aging in place design are the same, whether planning for yourself, someone who wants to age in place, or to suit the needs of a growing family. The goal is to create a safe, accessible design for everyone to enjoy.</span></p>

<h3>Comfortable living for young and older family members</h3>
<p>There are many reasons to undertake a major renovation project. Not the least of which is to make the space safer and more accessible to those living there.</p>
<h4>What is aging in place remodeling?</h4>
<p>The aging in place design concept puts into practice products and techniques that will allow people to live in their homes as they grow older.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea of aging in place is fabulous because you stay healthier when you are able to live in your own home, &#8221; said Kammi Reiss of <a href="https://www.kammireissdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kammi Reiss Design</a>.</p>
<h4>What is the Living in Place concept?</h4>
<p>The concept shifts when taking other household members into account such as young couples with families. When it comes to designing a more functional home for young people, &#8220;no one wants to talk about aging,&#8221; said Natalia Pierce of <a href="https://detailbydesign.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Details by Design</a> and a Certified Living in Place Professional (CLIPP). &#8220;If you try to have that discussion with someone who is 35, it is not even on their radar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.livinginplace.institute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living in Place Institute</a> promotes safe and adaptable building techniques for everyone—of all ages—who may live in the house and certifies professionals in those techniques.</p>
<p>We speak with professionals involved with accessible design. It is clear that the difference between the two approaches is fairly narrow, which means there is a lot of overlap in design and construction approaches. Techniques and products that help an older person take care of themselves work fine for younger people, too. In fact, those techniques are just smart and universal designs that all <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors can execute.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-03.jpg" alt="tub to shower conversion with white subway tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47288" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />(<em>Above</em>) Planning ahead for retirement, Sweeten homeowner Mickey renovated his <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/an-accessible-kitchen-and-bath-remodel-make-good-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom shower</a> to assist with future limited mobility.</p>
<h3>Universal design general guidelines</h3>
<p>Accessible design can take many forms. And some techniques will not work in all situations. Most people recognize the entrance ramp as the symbol for this type of design. If you rely on a wheelchair or scooter or use a walker to get around and live in a detached house, ramps make your life a lot easier. But if you are renovating a third-floor condo, a ramp may not be an option.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most accessible approaches are fairly intuitive and easy to accomplish. &#8220;We tell <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors</a> to keep doing what they have been doing, but just do it a little differently,&#8221; said Erik Listou, co-founder of the Living in Place Institute. &#8220;If you are going to install a handrail on a stair, put one on both sides. It&#8217;s much safer.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Here are some general tips for universal design:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Install adequate lighting—As people age, they tend to require brighter lights throughout the home. Light levels should be constant because it takes some people longer to adjust when moving from bright to dark areas. &#8220;We install electrical outlet covers with nightlights in them,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4914#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Aaron</a>. &#8220;They work for everyone, and they help guide the way safely when someone needs to use the bathroom at night.&#8221;</li>
<li>Create contrasts when levels change, especially on stairs. &#8220;If you are going down the stairs and the surfaces of the steps all look the same, you may not tell where one step ends,&#8221; said Kammi. &#8220;A light above the stairs can cast shadows to show the edge of the step.&#8221; Stairs with contrasting color edges or traction strips are other safe options.</li>
<li>Upgrade doorways—All doors, including interior doors, should be at least 36 inches wide to accommodate a wheelchair. The door hardware should be levers rather than knobs, which are difficult for some older people, as well as young children, to use.</li>
<li>Embrace the smart home—There are a number of devices that can be controlled from a smartphone, tablet, or home computer. Some systems allow the user to adjust the thermostat, lock doors, and turn lights on and off. There are even systems that will send out an alert if the water heater is leaking. Video doorbells let those inside see who is at the door without opening it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35028 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-13.jpg" alt="aging in place kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-13-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Marie and John renovated their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brooklyn-grandparents-renovate-kensington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aging-in-place home</a></span></p>
<h3>Aging in place remodeling in the kitchen</h3>
<p>Kitchens offer a number of opportunities to incorporate safe universal designs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cabinets—Typical kitchen design can pose a problem for people who have trouble reaching above their heads or bending to get into a base cabinet. Pull-down shelves for wall cabinets and pull-out drawers for base cabinets make them more accessible.</li>
<li>Sinks—Someone in a wheelchair or scooter needs to be able to pull up under the sink to use it. &#8220;On one of our projects, we installed removable panels at the sink, &#8221; said <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333333;">Robert who works with Sweeten contractor Aaron.</span> </span>&#8220;If they need to in the future, they can remove the panel and roll up under the sink.&#8221; All plumbing should be equipped with levers rather than knobs. Faucets with no-touch operation are another option.</li>
<li>Appliances—Some codes require a five-foot diameter turning radius in front of refrigerators for wheelchair users. If that is not an option, Kammi likes French-door refrigerators. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to back away very far when you open part of it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You can also put the things you use the most often on one side of the door.&#8221; Kammi also believes that microwaves should be placed at counter or below counter height. &#8220;That way everyone can use it—the child who wants to pop in his chicken nuggets or the grandmother who wants to heat up their coffee.&#8221;</li>
<li>Counters—A matte finish will create less glare than a counter with a glossy finish, especially when there are under-cabinet lights in place. A contrasting edge treatment can help someone with poor eyesight distinguish the edge of the counter.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Aging in place bathroom design</h3>
<p>Because of the combination of wet, slippery surfaces found in bathrooms, the rooms can be dangerous for someone with limited mobility or some other impairment. Fortunately, many of the items described below have evolved in design as well as function. They do not have an &#8220;institutional&#8221; look. There are towel bars, soap dishes, toilet paper holders, and other accessories that are grab-bar rated, meaning they can support the weight of an average adult. They are available in finishes that match other bathroom fixtures. Some key elements of aging in place remodeling include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the right location—If possible, install a bathroom on the first floor large enough so that a wheelchair can maneuver around easily.</li>
<li>Install showers—The best option is a roll-in, or barrier-free shower—one with no curb—that is equipped with grab bars and a built-in bench. &#8220;Barrier-free showers not only look awesome, but they are also just better and safer,&#8221; said Natalia.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35992 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="aging in place bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Daughters <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/senior-friendly-bathroom-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added a bathroom</a> to the ground floor of their house for their mother</span></p>
<h4>Showers &amp; bathtubs for aging-in-place bathrooms</h4>
<p>Both Kammi and Sweeten contractor Aaron said that even if the clients don&#8217;t want grab bars or built-in benches, they always install wood blocking behind the shower walls so that the grab bars can be added easily later.</p>
<p>A hand-held shower head with anti-scald valves prevents burns when the water pressure changes. &#8220;Even if you are fully mobile, suppose you have an accident and break your leg? The hand-held shower head and shower bench will come in handy,&#8221; said Kammi.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flooring—Slip-resistant floor tiles make everyone&#8217;s time in the bathroom safer.</li>
<li>Aging in place toilets—A seat extender on a standard toilet makes it easier for people with mobility problems to use. New toilets should be listed as compliant with the requirements of the American with Disabilities Act.</li>
<li>Sinks—Wall-hung sinks allow someone in a wheelchair to roll right up to basin. Kammi designed a bathroom with double sinks. One has a vanity beneath it; the other is open with a removable panel so that someone in a wheelchair can use it easily. When it is not in use an attractive bench sits in front of the sink, &#8220;making it look like a choice to have the bench under the sink cabinet,&#8221; she said.</li>

<h3>When to start thinking about aging in place remodeling</h3>
<p>Although most of her younger clients do not think in terms of accessibility, it is important to Kammi and other designers to incorporate it into their projects. &#8220;No one asks for it,&#8221; Kammi said, &#8220;but when designing I must consider it.&#8221; If attractive design and the easing of physical limitations can complement each other, it may be worth taking into account for when you might need it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Accessible bathroom renovation projects make homes safe now and in the future</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no doubting the charm of old apartments and homes. Unfortunately, many of them lack an essential quality found in more modern buildings: accessibility. At Sweeten, we’ve seen an uptick in renovators specifically asking for accessible bathroom renovation. From requests like adding higher toilets to safety bars, modern homeowners are prioritizing the safety of their loved ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These four bathroom renovations, all completed by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> general contractors, highlight how to update older spaces to make them more comfortable and secure. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>1. Future planning</h3>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Elaine-Hellew-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37098 mb-0 size-full" title="taupe-walls-and floor-tiles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Elaine-Hellew-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="floating bathroom vanity with mirror and taupe walls and floor tiles and walk-in shower with glass wall and mosaic floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Elaine-Hellew-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Elaine-Hellew-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Elaine-Hellew-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elaine’s multi-floor Brooklyn brownstone was designed before accessibility was top of mind. Thinking of the future, Elaine wanted to create a first-floor living space so she wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about climbing stairs. She decided to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/brooklyn-bathroom-staying-in-place-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update a bathroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (that hadn’t been renovated since the ‘80s) on the first floor, where there’s also a kitchen. The bathtub was replaced with a walk-in shower, complete with a handicap bar and handheld shower. It also has a stone-effect floor to help prevent slipping.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>2. Shower safety</h3>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Debbie-Francis-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35840 mb-0 size-full" title="accessible bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Debbie-Francis-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Complete with a shower seat and handheld shower head, this accessible bathroom renovation makes it safe and easy for anyone with limited mobility" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Debbie-Francis-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Debbie-Francis-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Debbie-Francis-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two subpar bathrooms are definitely not better than one great one. Debbie helped her father move out of his two-story home into a co-op in the Bronx that was </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/elderly-senior-friendly-bathroom-the-bronx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more safe and accessible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for using his wheelchair or walker. However, the bathrooms were not working for his needs. After matching with a Sweeten general contractor, Debbie combined the two spaces into a single bathroom with a low-curbed shower, a shower seat, and safety bars.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>3. Ground floor bathroom addition</h3>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35991 mb-0 size-full" title="shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="This curbless shower makes it easy to access for wheel-chair or walker-bound individuals" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sisters in Queens approached Sweeten about turning an unused room into an </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/senior-friendly-bathroom-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">entirely new first-floor bathroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their mother. After demolishing, reframing, and equipping the space for plumbing, the family chose fixtures and made design decisions. A curbless shower is large enough to fit a shower chair and makes for easier entry. The toilet measures in at 17-inches high, aligning with ADA-compliant standards. </span></p>
<h3></h3>
<hr />
<h3>4. &#8220;Aging-in-place&#8221; oasis</h3>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35033 mb-0 size-full" title="light-tiled-bathroom-with-mirror" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19.jpg" alt="light tiled bathroom with large mirror and shower glass for walk in shower area after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Marie and John moved back to their native New York City, they wanted a home that could both accommodate large family gatherings and be an </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brooklyn-grandparents-renovate-kensington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“aging-in-place” oasis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For this accessible bathroom renovation, their Sweeten architect focused on choosing materials and design elements that were easy to maintain throughout the home. This included heat-resistant countertops in the kitchen and large-scale bath tiles that required less grout in the bathroom. Replacing the bathtub for a walk-in shower was high on the list of priorities too.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>For two Brooklyn grandparents with aging-in-place plans, a layout change turns their co-op into an oasis</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35016 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-07-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, kitchen renovation, open layout, Brooklyn grandparents renovate" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marie and John are both NYC natives who had lived in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. for many years. When their first grandchild was born in Brooklyn in 2014, they began plotting the move back to their hometown. After John retired in 2017, the couple decided to buy a home that would accommodate large gatherings with their friends, five children, and the growing number of grandkids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35478 size-chrono" title="Marie and John" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-22-723x482.jpg" alt="Marie and John, Brooklyn grandparents, home renovation, home, design construction" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35017 size-chrono" title="floor plan " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-Floorplan-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, kitchen renovation, open layout" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35019 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, living room, open layout" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a four-month search with unsuccessful bids on two other properties, Marie and John visited an open house in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn. “Even though it was a very wet, snowy day in early 2017, there were many potential buyers,” Marie said. &#8220;We both liked the size and layout and could see great potential in the space. There were 12 large windows with three exposures, which won us over. We ended up paying over asking price, but were satisfied with the deal.” The 3-bed, 1.5-bath co-op boasted about 1,300 square feet of living space and was close to Prospect Park as well as their children. The closing occurred in May; the couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned to Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found a Sweeten architect</a> to help with a thorough renovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-BEFORE-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35024 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-BEFORE-01-723x933.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, living room, design, renovation, open layout" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35021 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, living room, design, renovation, open layout" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although serviceable, the apartment needed some TLC in terms of remodeling the kitchen, bathroom, and converting an existing half-bath into a master bath with a shower. They also wanted to open up the space so that the three exposures could bring light into every corner of the apartment. The conversation with their Sweeten architect resulted in architectural renderings, which planned the space as an &#8220;age-in-place oasis&#8221; for the active couple who wanted the convenience and amenities of city living while also being able to host a large extended family.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-05.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35023 size-chrono" title="french doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-05.gif" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, french doors, sliding doors, living room" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35022 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, living room, design, open layout" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To accommodate the couple’s desire to age in place and ultimately remain in the apartment as long as possible, their architect added accessible design features in the bathrooms. Materials and design were also implemented for easy maintenance, such as closets to keep spaces clutter-free, large-scale bath ceramic tile that required less grout, and moisture- and heat-resistant Caesarstone kitchen countertops.</p>

</a>(<em>Befores above</em>) Dining room cabinets replaced the closets (l.); kitchen entry located to the right. The wall was removed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the common spaces, a reconfigured layout maximized the open space for entertaining and cooking. A windowed den was previously accessible through the kitchen, but a reorientation connected it to the living room, which made more sense. The den could double as a guest room when necessary but would serve as a corner office on a daily basis. The pocket doors, which created an opening of six feet, could be left open so that more natural light entered the living room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen, which previously had a tile floor, was re-laid with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardwood</a> to match that in the living room. The new continuous flooring helped unify the now open-plan living area. “Our new kitchen was outfitted with gray IKEA Bodbyn cabinets and glossy deep crimson glass tiles for the backsplash. It’s the extra special spark to our gray kitchen,” Marie said. The tall upper cabinets take advantage of the high ceiling and provide extra storage space. &#8220;Based on our own past experience, we chose quartz countertops,&#8221; she added. &#8220;The fact that it is practically indestructible met our desire for a low-maintenance lifestyle.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The demolition of a wall between the kitchen and the dining alcove transformed the previously dark space into a brightly lit and well-integrated dining area. Their Sweeten architect also replaced the existing closets at the back of the dining space with additional cabinetry that matched the kitchen. Upper cabinets were faced with glass and a mirrored backsplash which the homeowners loved. A spherical chandelier in bronze was hung above the dining table as a statement piece.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The next major transformation was in the master bath, which was originally a powder room (they planned to borrowed square footage from a second bedroom). The tiny space had no room for a shower, which the homeowners wanted, so the architect embarked on an arduous process of convincing the co-op board that increasing the footprint of the bathroom, which involved creating wet-over-dry conditions (something that’s usually a no-no for co-ops), would not be a problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35032 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-20-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, bathroom, renovation, shower, toilet, Brooklyn grandparents" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to allay the concerns of the board, the architect met with the board and building engineer to go over all of the precautions that would be taken as well as the materials that were chosen and installation methods. The result of their architect&#8217;s perseverance: excellent water- and sound-proofing so that neighboring apartments would not be affected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They chose light-colored <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tile for the floors</a> and walls, with accent tiles for the shower floor and niche. The design included a long safety bar inside the shower for more stability when showering—one of the features that would accommodate Marie and John as they age. A large square sink from Duravit sits on a stand with modern lines and one shelf below.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The guest bath featured a large mirror with a stone shelf beneath and lighter colors. Safety handlebars were also added to the inside of the bathtub wall. For easy cleaning and to free up the floor space, wall-hung sinks were installed. “This bathroom has no window, but looks bright, large, and attractive,” Marie said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-18-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35343 mb-0 size-chrono" title="shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-18-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, bathroom renovation, shower head, shower, Brooklyn grandparents" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation was a true collaboration between the homeowners and the architect. Marie explained, “Our Sweeten architect was extremely helpful, making suggestions, listening to our opinions and helping us decide. She seemed to be totally invested while following our tastes and budget.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How do they feel about their new home? “Our new space feels comfortable and cozy,&#8221; Marie said. &#8220;The natural light combined with our light fixtures make it a happy place to live. We feel very much at home&#8230;like we have been here for a long time.”</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Marie and John. We hope you’ll have many happy family gatherings in your new home!</em></p>
