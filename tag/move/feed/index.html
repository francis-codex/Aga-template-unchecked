										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What can homeowners do when they need more space at home—but don&#8217;t want to leave?</h2>
<p>Many homeowners find themselves in a tough spot when their home&#8217;s space, design, or location stops working for them. Many wind up asking themselves: should I move, or remodel?  A <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/americans-prefer-renovations-21576/">Zillow study</a> found that when given a choice between spending a fixed budget on a down payment or using the same amount to remodel, 76 percent would opt to renovate.</p>
<p>Between leaving their neighborhoods and staying put, these homeowners ultimately made the choice to reimagine their homes with Sweeten&#8217;s help. <span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>A big refresh for a beloved loft</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leah and Brian loved the Logan Square <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loft they had been calling home</a> for several years. The Chicago neighborhood’s energy and the industrial brick warehouse added to the lifestyle they were enjoying. But with time the wear-and-tear takes a toll on materials and daily functioning. They decided to renovate and stay in the area. The couple posted their project on Sweeten to update the entire space including a new kitchen and floors. Without structural changes, Leah and Brian brought out the best of their 14-foot ceilings.</span></p>

<h3>When you can&#8217;t go bigger, get creative</h3>
<p>Surging prices in her Fort Greene co-op building made upgrading from a studio to a true one-bedroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">out of the question for Mollie</a>. She had to decide to either move elsewhere to get more space or remodel her cozy studio. Luckily, Mollie realized the market value of her apartment (and that she could borrow against her equity)! She came to Sweeten, was matched with a general contractor, and reconfigured the 500-square-foot apartment to suit her playful style.</p>

<h3>Baby on the way? Make your square footage go further</h3>
<p>A two-bedroom apartment was perfect for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-duplex-renovated-for-a-new-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel and Marco</a>—until they decided to expand their family. Fortunately, their duplex had enough square footage for them to get creative with! This made it possible to remodel and rethink how they used the layout, instead of moving. They turned the top floor into a combined kitchen and living area, while they divided the rest of the space into an office, closet, and bedrooms.</p>

<h3>Give a well-loved home some TLC upgrades</h3>
<p>After a year-long search for a new apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/renovating-to-stay-in-a-beloved-neighborhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Igor</a> decided their sons’ schools, proximity to work, and an overall adoration for their lifestyle in Carroll Gardens were reason enough to stay in their apartment. They worked with a Sweeten general contractor to overhaul their dark kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom. The result? Open and modern spaces fit for the family of four.</p>

<h3>Combine two apartments into one home, sweet home</h3>
<p>A desire for more room led to multiple (unsuccessful) apartment searches for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoe and Arvid</a>. Her dream of renovating and combining apartments finally put the hunt to an end. After contacting neighbors and finding one who was looking to move, their plan was underway. The additional square footage allowed for a third bedroom, a much larger kitchen, and an expanded living area.</p>

<h3>Getting &#8220;upstate&#8221; light and space—with a city zip code</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney and Jim’s</a> Clinton Hill Co-op apartment lacked storage and light, which sent them on a search for a second home upstate. When they made an offer on the second property, reality hit: they needed to make their main residence work for them before taking on a new place. The couple decided to remodel, opening up the kitchen the rest of the living areas and reconfiguring storage closets to suit the family of four’s storage needs.</p>
