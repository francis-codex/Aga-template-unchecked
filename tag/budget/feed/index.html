			<h2>Yes, revised estimates are possible, but be ready to compromise and collaborate</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="living-room-with-doors" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision.jpg" alt="Living room with doors and room view before renovation" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51371" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you’ve received a remodeling estimate from your Sweeten general contractor. What if the total exceeds your budget—can you ask for a revised estimate?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short answer: Yes, with limitations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>When can I ask for a lower or revised renovation estimate?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can generally expect a single round of minor revisions for free. If you need major scope changes or multiple versions of the estimate, expect your contractor to ask for money up-front. This is because calculating estimates requires substantial work. If you hire the contractor, this fee will typically be treated as a deposit and will count toward the total renovation cost. You won’t be out-of-pocket unless you ask a contractor for extensive revisions and then decline to hire them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What revisions are considered minor? Minor revisions involve eliminating part of the project or making simple substitutions (switching from custom imported tiles to standard subway tiles, etc.).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you negotiate for a lower price, you must always think in terms of reduced scope or lower-priced materials. Don’t just ask for a discount! General contractors don’t leave room for discounts in their estimates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely ask your contractor for advice on how to meet a lower budget. Their experience can be invaluable in strategizing where to cut costs<span>—</span>and where not to. </span></p>
<h3>Ballpark quote vs. formal remodeling estimate</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind the difference between a contractor’s initial ballpark quote and their formal estimate. That first quote may be based on your posted Sweeten project and a brief conversation. The formal estimate will come after a site visit, a longer discussion, and hours of behind-the-scenes research and calculation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you receive your initial quote, this is the time to discuss your budget limits and to be clear about your must-haves vs. your nice-to-haves. Giving your <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor the important information up-front</a> will help you avoid major revisions entirely.</span></p>
<h3>Do:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discuss your scope and budget with your contractor before they draft an estimate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After your site visit, feel free to postpone requesting an estimate. If you need time to think about your budget, ask for it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask your contractor for advice on reducing the scope to meet your budget</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect to pay for major estimate revisions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect to wait a few days for major estimate revisions</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Don’t:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask for a discount without a change in scope or materials</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask for a formal estimate before you’re clear on your budget</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect major revisions for free</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect major revisions quickly</span></li>

			<h2>Providing deposits for contractors is a crucial<span>—and normal—step in starting a renovation</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="room-ready-for-renovation" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront.jpg" alt="Image of room ready for renovation" width="1000" height="665" class="alignnone wp-image-51631 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Short answer: Yes. </span><span class="s1">But there are exceptions, and your contractor may have some flexibility. Below, Sweeten outlines the reasons behind upfront payment amounts, and some options for negotiating your deposit for a contractor.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do contractors require a deposit?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deposits for contractors are critical because they essentially allow your project to begin! Your general contractor needs to secure a crew and begin <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordering materials right away</a>. They may also need to rent equipment. And your contractor can’t take on all the financial liability for these commitments themself.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much of a deposit can a contractor ask for? </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The exact deposit amount contractors ask for upfront varies and is especially dependent on the size of the project. For relatively small jobs, like a $16,000 <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/">bathroom remodel</a>, contractors may ask for a 50% deposit. For large jobs, like a $100,000 <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/">full-home renovation</a>, a 10%–20% deposit is more typical. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Is the deposit for a contractor negotiable?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might be. In many cases, contractors start with a standardized contract, so some of the terms could be based on a typical job rather than the specifics of yours. You may be able to ask for somewhat lower initial payment or deposit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ideal time to ask is during negotiations (—an important part of <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/">the contractor hiring process</a>), before the contractor drafts the contract. But they may be amenable to a minor contract alteration after the fact. Just know that their flexibility may be limited. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What about the remaining payments?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">General contractors use a number of different fee structures. The payment schedule might be based on fixed dates, or on major project milestones. For small jobs, they’ll typically ask for just two payments—one upfront, the other at the end. For larger projects, there may be as many as five scheduled payments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most contractors ask for the final payment upon “substantial completion.” This means that everything’s complete except the punch list*, and possibly final work on minor finishes. Occasionally, a contractor will consider a job substantially complete when there’s a single large outstanding item—like an expensive fixture that’s held up by a shipping delay, but which won’t require much labor to install. When you&#8217;re ready to begin your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/">find a vetted and experienced contractor</a>. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">*The punch list is a tally of any minor problems for the contractor to fix—like a paint splatter, a missing drawer pull, a misaligned cabinet hinge, etc.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Points to remember for contractor deposits:</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Expect to pay a deposit for a contractor before work can begin<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Expect to pay a higher percentage on a smaller job, and vice-versa<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Discuss the contractors&#8217; deposit and payment schedule before they draft the contract<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">If you’d like to amend the contract, don’t expect the contractor to have unlimited flexibility<br />
</span></li>
</ul>

There’s the Dallas Cowboys (as well as real cowboys!) And of course, there’s BBQ. Dallas is a thriving city and a great place to renovate your dream home. <span class="s2">Sweeten</span>&#8216;s guide to 2021 Dallas remodeling costs</span><span class="s3"> provides a jumping-off point to get you on your way with estimates from Sweeten and the <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">2021 Cost vs Value Report</span></a>. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Developing a budget is your first step to your dream Dallas home. Sweeten contractors will want to sit down with you and inspect your home to reach an accurate number. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a quick overview of budgets for some typical renovation projects:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Gut renovation: starting at <strong>$80—$100</strong> per square foot (psf)</span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Budget kitchen remodel: starting at &#8211; <strong>$15,000</strong> (for a 75-100 sf space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: starting at <strong>$25,000—$30,000</strong> (for a 75-100 sf space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">High-end kitchen remodel: starting at <strong>$40,000</strong> (for a 75-100 sf space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Budget bathroom remodel: starting at <strong>$8,000—$15,000</strong> (for a 35-square-foot space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: starting at <strong>$15,000—$25,000</strong> (for a 35-square-foot space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">High-end bathroom remodel and expansion: starting at <strong>$30,000</strong> (for a 35-square-foot space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Deck composite: <strong>$19,000</strong> or <strong>$60</strong> psf</span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Wood deck: <strong>$13,000</strong> or <strong>$40</strong> psf</span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Keep in mind that every professional contractor will want to have a detailed conversation with you. They will also inspect your home before developing an estimate specific to your needs and wants.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up and your material order starts at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s7"><b>“</b></span><span class="s1">With the lockdowns from covid, we saw companies cut production and manpower with the expectation that construction would slow down (which it did not),” </span><span class="s8">Dallas-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6958#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s9">Sweeten contractor Joel</span></a></span><span class="s7"> said,</span><span class="s1"> “and it took awhile to ramp up production.” With a large influx of people moving out of the coastal cities and into the South and Midwest, “there’s been an increase in housing demand making quality labor more expensive.” </span><span class="s7">Overall, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6896#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s10">Sweeten contractor Kyle</span></a>, who is also based in Dallas, <b>“</b></span><span class="s11">Costs are going up in today&#8217;s current environment for: the whole home, the kitchen, and the bathroom.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p9"><span class="s1">Dallas home remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A total gut renovation in Dallas that brings your home down to its bare bones and remodels it to your liking, starts at <strong>$80—$100</strong> psf. For a home that has budget finishes, this means materials such as laminate flooring and countertops, value-brand appliances, and basic tiles from big box stores like Home Depot. These scenarios, however, are dependant on the scope of work and existing conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although a gut renovation is a big project, consider doing it all at once to get you the best bang for your buck. You&#8217;ll also have your dream home much quicker than renovating room by room. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">As a guide, </span><span class="s12">Joel</span><span class="s1"> advises clients to tie the price of their kitchen (or bathroom) renovation to the price of their home. You should only spend between 10 and 20 percent of the value “to really cap the budget at the return on investment,” </span><span class="s12">Joel</span><span class="s1"> said. So for a <strong>$300,000</strong> home, aim to spend between <strong>$30,000</strong> and <strong>$60,000</strong> on a bathroom or kitchen remodel, which will be a major slice of a gut renovation project. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Before getting started, general <span class="s2">contractor Kyle</span> suggests homeowners research other recent remodels in the area to see what materials and appliances were used. This is important if you want to resell quickly so you don’t end up with a budget-level renovation in a high-end area or vice versa. If this is your forever home, then your personal taste is more important than whoever you might sell to years later.  </span></p>
<h3 class="p9"><span class="s1">How much a Dallas kitchen remodel costs per square foot in 2021</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li11"><span class="s13"></span><span class="s14">A kitchen renovation i</span><span class="s5">n the budget range can start at <strong>$10,000</strong> and reach <strong>$15,000</strong>. This would apply to a 75-100-square-foot room. To get a new kitchen at this price, it needs to be a rip-and-replace job, meaning a layout of the kitchen must stay the same with pipes and appliances remaining where they are. Cabinets are the highest ticket item in a kitchen budget, said </span><span class="s12">Joel</span><span class="s5">. To keep costs down, cabinets can be re-stained or re-painted. The next upgrade is pre-fab followed by semi-custom. Fully custom costs the most, he said.</span></li>
<li class="li11"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">A mid-grade kitchen remodel in Dallas at the same square footage has costs starting at <strong>$25,000—$30,000</strong>. What does a mid-grade kitchen look like at this starting cost? The kitchen layout must remain the same as a rip-and-replace: swap your old oven for a new one and your old sink for a new sink. You can get a stainless steel sink with a single-lever faucet, laminate countertops, a built-in microwave, new appliances, custom lighting, and semi-custom cabinets. An island could also be added. Moving plumbing, gas, and electrical, reconfiguring the layout, or choosing custom features will increase the budget.</span><span class="s15"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p12"><span class="s5">“A kitchen with upgraded material and selections, as well as special additions such pot fillers, custom-built islands, under cabinet lighting, etc. can drive up the cost to <strong>$50,000</strong> and higher,” says Sweeten contractor Kyle.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li11"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">For an upscale kitchen that is 75-100 square feet, labor costs and a refresh with select high-end materials such as marble or quartz countertops, imported backsplash tile, and high-quality fixtures start at <strong>$40,000</strong>.</span><span class="s15"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">The upscale kitchens Kyle has worked on were budgeted from <strong>$50,000</strong> and up. A big chunk of those budgets were custom-made cabinets as well as quartz countertops and expensive backsplashes. “Adding French doors or moving walls to create a larger kitchen” also brings up the price, Kyle said. As will above and below cabinet lighting, moving plumbing, and custom-built islands.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">There are plenty of variables in most materials, according to Sweeten contractor </span><span class="s12">Joel</span><span class="s1">. For example, with quartz you can spend <strong>$2,000</strong> or <strong>$7,000</strong> depending upon the quality. “It just comes down to not overbuilding for your house,” </span><span class="s12">Joel </span><span class="s1">advised.</span></p>
<h3 class="p9"><span class="s1">How much a Dallas bathroom remodel costs per square foot in 2021</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">At the budget level, expect a rip-and-replace bathroom with no behind-the-wall surprises to start at <strong>$8,000—$15,000</strong>. These are typically smaller master baths or guest bathrooms at 35 square feet. The layout will remain the same where plumbing doesn’t move, Kyle said. This budget won’t include any issues like leaks or mold discovered once the project begins. Materials will include a prefabricated vanity, ceramic tile, and fixtures from big-box stores.</span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">In the Dallas area, a 35-square-foot mid-grade bathroom can start at <strong>$15,000—$25,000</strong>. The average cost for this price range remodel is about <strong>$22,866</strong> or <strong>$653</strong> psf with the same dimensions, according to the 2021 Cost vs Value Report. The key to a budget in this range is rip-and-replace. This means keeping the layout the same and swapping out an old toilet for a new one, an old vanity for a new one, etc. That way, no expensive plumbing work is needed.</span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can install a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. More than 55 percent of your budget </span><span class="s3">can be recouped in the value the project adds to your home.  </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li11"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">For a high-end bathroom remodel and expansion, the cost can start at <strong>$30,000</strong>. This budget includes a three-piece bathroom (tub/shower combo, toilet, and sink) for a typical 5’ x 7’ space. The cost increases with features including a double vanity, creating a separate shower from the tub, specialty tile, a custom vanity, or a toilet with additional functions.</span><span class="s15"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Cost drivers are things like removing an existing tub or shower to install a new standalone tub,” said Sweeten contractor Kyle. It can also include building larger showers, moving walls to expand bathroom size, custom vanities, and frameless glass shower enclosure.</span></p>
<h3 class="p13"><span class="s1">2021 costs to adding outdoor space to a Dallas-area home</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dallas is a city perfect for outdoor entertaining, whether it’s a crisp winter night in front of the fire pit or a cold beer paired with a hot summer evening. An outdoor area is often the cherry on top of a dream home remodel. It’s the project to really let your creative juices flow. There are endless options to make your outdoor area your own with extensive outdoor kitchens, gas fireplaces, fans and misting systems for cooling, custom lighting, and landscaping. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A basic wooden deck will likely cost <strong>$49</strong> psf or <strong>$15,678</strong> for something in the 320 square foot range, according to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report. A deck made from composite, a mix of wood product and plastic, will cost just under <strong>$20,857</strong> for the same size or <strong>$65</strong> psf. This material tends to last longer and requires less maintenance. </span></p>
<h3 class="p13"><span class="s1">2021 Dallas remodeling costs: Permits</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dallas is experiencing a lot of new building construction. This has resulted in a more rigorous approval process compared to approvals for existing homes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are numerous cities and towns that make up Dallas. Each one has its own building department and its own fee structure for permits. Your Sweeten contractor will likely put an estimate in the budget for building permits, which will be determined by your end costs or square footage of your project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The upmarket suburb of <a href="https://www.hptx.org/179/Fees"><span class="s2">Highland Park</span></a> bases building permit costs on square footage. The permit for a 200 square foot kitchen renovation costs <strong>$490</strong>, according to Highland Park’s calculator.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the city of Addison,<span class="s2"> </span><a href="https://addisontexas.net/sites/default/files/fileattachments/development_services/page/10881/fee_schedule_for_bldg_permits.pdf"><span class="s2">building permit fees</span></a> for a project with a budget between <strong>$2,000</strong> and <strong>$25,000</strong> will have a base cost of <strong>$115</strong> with an additional <strong>$23</strong> per <strong>$1,000</strong> for estimated costs over <strong>$2,000</strong>. That means the permit for a <strong>$20,000</strong> mid-grade bathroom remodel will cost <strong>$529</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building permit fees in <span class="s2">Cedar Hill</span>, southwest of the city’s center, are determined by square footage. There is a set fee of <strong>$400</strong> for any renovation of less than 1,250 square feet. For each additional square foot over 1,250, the permit increases by <strong>$.60</strong>. After 2,500 square feet, it increases by <strong>$.40</strong>.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Demolition, amount of work, a home&#8217;s condition, and alternate living arrangements all affect gut home renovation costs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="cost-gutting-kitchen-and-remodel" class="alignnone wp-image-50823 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cover-costs-for-gut-remodel-01.jpg" alt="gutted kitchen with studs and frames exposed during renovation" width="1000" height="676" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cover-costs-for-gut-remodel-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cover-costs-for-gut-remodel-01-300x203.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cover-costs-for-gut-remodel-01-600x406.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A different level of owner commitment comes with a gut home renovation than a smaller renovation project. Here, Sweeten provides some guidance on points to consider when planning a major project like this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Sweeten</span><span class="s1"> matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">What’s involved in a gut home renovation?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First, let’s define the term. Gutting a home is more than an extensive remodel. It’s taking the walls down to the studs, removing existing interior doors and trim, cabinets, sinks, and exposing the structure of the home. It often includes replacing windows and exterior doors, the roof, and replacing most or all plumbing and electrical. Gutting is about the material removal before you remodel.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">A renovation budget overview</span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Costs of materials</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ll find Sweeten’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation cost guides</a> here but keep in mind material costs and timelines have shifted. Prices for materials and labor have jumped, drastically in some cases and in some locales. It’s a good idea to add 20% to the materials budget and talk with your contractor about timing, materials, and budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Do not wait. Many sectors are experiencing a backlog in the supply of materials. For homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices may continue to go up and your material order will be at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s3">“Must-haves” and “Nice-to-haves” lists</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When making your project budget, it’s important to create a renovation list of “must-haves.” These are elements that are definitely required for the project, then make a second wishlist of “nice-to-haves.” This includes all of the changes you’d like to see but might be willing to forgo as you consider your budget. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">A home’s existing condition</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s also crucial to be realistic about the condition of your home, as the cost of a gut renovation can vary considerably by the condition of the structure. Updating the mechanical systems such as the electrical panel and old plumbing can range from straightforward in a dated foursquare house to challenging in a home located in an historic district.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ask your contractor about worst-case scenarios given the building’s age and history. Consider the budget contingency that will give you peace of mind when your project kicks off. Your contractor can’t price out every possible surprise, but you should feel confident that you have a partner who will help you problem-solve when challenges come up.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Have a contingency plan</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Homeowners undertaking serious gut remodels should build in an extra cash reserve for issues that come up along the way including issues that come up once the walls are broken into. Add more than 15% for a gut remodel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bathrooms contain the most plumbing and fixtures per square foot so tend to be the most expensive spaces in the house per square foot. Kitchens are next, then the other living spaces follow.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Should you leave or stay during a gut home renovation?</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the most important considerations is <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deciding where you’ll live during the project</a>. Nearly anything is possible, so you probably <i>can</i> remain in the house during the project. However, nearly any other plan is preferable for most people because you’ll almost certainly have to deal with surprises. You might discover a need for structural reinforcement, or unveil mold or asbestos, and decide then that you should reside elsewhere for a while. Also, if you do choose to stay during the project, you’ll need to make sure that you’re legally allowed to do so, too. Your city’s building department is the place to inquire.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just remember that if you decide to stay in the home during the project to save money, you’ll still incur costs, and they could be substantial. Financial costs include delaying the project because you or your things are in the way. Non-financial costs could include a strain on daily family routines such as finding alternatives for when a kitchen or shower is being renovated. All those can result in financial costs, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your contractor will guide you through the cost for permits and regulations associated with your project, such as placing dumpsters. If your home is in a homeowner’s association, they will also have requirements to meet.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Demolition before renovation</span></h4>
<p class="p7"><span class="s4">The demolition part of gutting a home is mostly labor and disposal costs, so it’s not really that expensive but removing plumbing pipes and drains and so on takes time. O</span><span class="s5">utsourcing the demo or doing it as a DIY project doesn’t really save much money. For safety and hazard concerns, Sweeten recommends leaving demolition to the professionals. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note that moving walls is not included in these costs. Moving load-bearing walls requires consulting with a structural engineer, and that could be $500—$1,000. Whenever you change walls around you’ll need to build temporary support walls, so there’s another cost to add in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During demolition, you may discover hazards like asbestos, lead paint, and mold. If you do, a pro will evaluate how extensive the problem is. These hazards are not DIY-friendly. In some places, you’re not legally permitted to deal with these dangerous materials, especially asbestos which can only be handled by a professional.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">The general contractor brings subcontractor connections</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finally, managing an extensive construction project like gutting a home is challenging and benefits from having an experienced general contractor. A general contractor usually has steady and long-standing connections to many subcontractors, so communication often goes smoothly. They will orchestrate and schedule between architects, engineers, plumbers, electricians, and other skilled labor. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Architects <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-work-with-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specialize in bringing ideas to fruition</a>, and they must communicate with homeowners at a high level. An architect must have a crystal-clear vision of how to transform the current home into the space you dream of. Getting the input of the architect as early in the process as possible will be invaluable in helping you mentally walk through the steps in advance. Sweeten design-build firms have in-house architectural services. Alternatively, Sweeten contractors can refer an architect if the project needs one. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gutting a home is a major project. Having an understanding of the process with the guidance of the right general contractor and team sets you on a path for a smoother renovation. And a step closer to your dream home. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figuring out the cost of renovating a house can be nerve-wracking for first-time Chicago renovators. You’ve finally moved on from daydreaming to starting a remodel of your home. Start by gathering some basic details: know what you can actually afford, and plan to add a small reserve on top of that. The materials you want to use also factor in, as well as how much work will be done. Plus, everything that isn’t visible—the infrastructure—will impact your costs. This can be a lot to keep track of, especially if this is your first time renovating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, we have done some of the legwork in this guide to Chicago remodeling costs. This guide focuses on some of the major remodeling categories: <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole house remodels</a>, kitchen, bath, additions—as well as permits. You can use these details to create an accurate budget for a Chicago-area renovation.</span></p>
<h3>Baseline home renovation costs in Chicago</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a breakdown of typical starting home renovation costs (including labor and materials) gathered from <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full-home renovation: From </span><b>$105</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per square foot (psf) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget bath remodel: </span><b>$16,500 </b>(standard full size)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-grade bath remodel: </span><b>$26,000 </b>(standard full size)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-end bath remodel: </span><b>$37,500 </b>(standard full size)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget kitchen remodel: </span><b>$23,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  (medium-sized)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: </span><b>$35,500 <span style="font-weight: 400;">(medium-sized)</span></b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-end kitchen remodel: </span><b>$72,000 <span style="font-weight: 400;">(medium-sized)</span></b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basement remodel: </span><b>$40,000—$75,000</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that every professional contractor will want to have a detailed conversation with you. They will also inspect your home before developing an estimate specific to your needs and wants.</span></p>
<p><b>Pro tip:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up and your material order starts at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h3>Chicago remodeling costs per square foot</h3>
<h4>Gut renovation vs. non-gut renovation</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gutting a home pretty much means starting from scratch. You&#8217;ll take everything down to the studs or framework, and/or you&#8217;ll knock down walls. Because it&#8217;s more intricate, the average cost to gut and remodel a house starts at the higher end of the </span><b>$100 to $200</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf range. By contrast, a remodel of the space within existing walls will be at the lower end. For example, remodeling a 700-square-foot, one-bedroom condo may range from </span><b>$50,000 to $70,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while a gut reno likely will exceed </span><b>$100,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This work usually involves running new plumbing pipes and wiring, moving doorways, and possibly installing new flooring.</span></p>
<h4>Full home gut renovation costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs for a full home gut renovation start at </span><b>$105</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per square foot. Take note: this scope of work is extensive! Expect demo, framing, insulation and drywall, wiring, plumbing, heating/cooling systems, millwork, paint, flooring, tile, light fixtures, electronics, and all finishes. (This excludes appliances, which can significantly increase costs, depending on how high-end they are.) According to Chicago-based</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractor Ryan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “A whole-house renovation—say, 3,000 square feet—would cost </span><b>$200,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at the low end, and start at </span><b>$400,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the high end. It all depends on the materials chosen.”</span></p>
<h4>Wet room renovation costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wet rooms—connected to a water supply, such as bathrooms or kitchens—typically start at </span><b>$250</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf. In the city, bathrooms in condos or co-ops can be as small as 30 square feet. However, in freestanding homes, they are typically larger than 5’ x 8’.  High-end renovations that are fully custom with luxury materials can cost upwards of </span><b>$700</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per square foot. Architectural design and drawings, demolition, construction, materials, fixtures, lighting, and finishes are included in the fee.</span></p>
<h4>Build in a buffer to your budget</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contractors may build in overage fees to their estimates. This allows for the unexpected<span>—</span>which definitely can happen<span>—</span>to be covered. Overages are usually 10-15% of the project cost. (We recommend that the renovator reserve at least 10-15% above the bid as well). Don&#8217;t let the numbers shock you, though: the beauty of</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring <span style="font-weight: 400;">a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that it&#8217;s one-stop shopping. Working with a contractor covers pretty much <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/chicago-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all the trades required for the job</a>. This spares you the work of hiring individual tradesmen to complete the various aspects of your project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago-based</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6105#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractor Brad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommends being realistic about how much you can spend. “You can’t buy a <strong>$100,000</strong> ring on a <strong>$5,000</strong> budget. Nail down your contractor first; they know pricing. And add 15 percent for unexpected conditions.”</span></p>
<h3>Average cost of a kitchen remodel in Chicago</h3>
<h4>Budget kitchen renovation costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/how-to-remodel-a-kitchen-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process of remodeling a kitchen</a>, the typical starting point is <strong>$23,500</strong> based on a 100-square-foot space.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This translates to stock cabinets from a big-box store with space to fit <span>a refrigerator, a four-burner range, a dishwasher, and a microwave. Materials could include laminate flooring, tile under $10 / square foot, and fixtures by Delta and American Standard.</span></span></p>
<h4>Mid-grade kitchen renovation costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have found that <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revamping a kitchen</a> measuring 100 square feet at this finish level can start at <strong>$35,500</strong>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <span>Opting for mid-grade materials is a smart way to strike a balance between cost efficiency and quality. Some reputable options to consider include Diamond or Kemper cabinets, Caesarstone countertops, Daltile floors, and tiles from TileBar and Ann Sacks. For fixtures, brands like Brizo, Hansgrohe, and Kohler offer reliable choices. </span></span></p>
<h4>High-end kitchen costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on what we have seen, expect starting costs to be <strong>$37,500</strong> for a 100-square-foot room at this finish level. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect quality and craftsmanship with top-flight <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom cabinets</a>, stone or porcelain flooring, stone or quartz countertops, and tile from brands like <span>Cle Tile and Artistic Tile.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractor Ryan has seen kitchens cost </span><b>$50,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a gut remodel, and at the high end, closer to </span><b>$100,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Those figures,” he says, “can vary greatly, as some cabinetry alone might cost </span><b>$80,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>
<h3>Average bathroom remodel costs in Chicago</h3>
<h4>Budget bathroom remodel costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prepare for a bathroom remodel</a>, you&#8217;ll need to settle on a realistic budget. A starting point can be </span><b>$16,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a standard full bathroom with <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/two-bathroom-renovation-for-resale-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget-friendly finishes</a> from big box stores like Home Depot, Menards, and Lowe’s. Other materials for this budget <span>include stock vanities, </span>various tiles under $5/square foot,<span> and fixtures by Delta, Moen, and Pfister. </span>As this is a wet space, plumbing, electrical insulation, and exhausts, as well as correcting misaligned walls and floors will be part of the job.</span></p>
<h4>Mid-grade bathroom remodel costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A standard full bathroom typically includes <span>a sink, toilet, and bathtub or shower. The fixture count for a full bath is 3–4. Starting costs</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to overhaul a bathroom</a> is around </span><b>$26,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, standard toilet, fixtures by Kohler and Hansgrohe, vanity counter from Signature Hardware, and a porcelain tub.</span></p>
<h4>High-end bathroom remodel costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The typical cost at this finish level starts at <strong>$37</strong></span><b>,500</b> for a standard-size bathroom<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Features at this level include custom work, separate shower, freestanding tub, and custom lighting. High-end materials can include vanities by Robern and Duravit, fixtures by Brizo, and tile by Artistic Tile and Ann Sacks.</span></p>
<h3>Costs for a primary bedroom suite addition</h3>
<h4>Mid-grade primary suite addition costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimated costs are around </span><b>$452</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf or </span><b>$177,273</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a 24&#8242; x 16&#8242; space, including double vanity, freestanding tub, separate shower, walk-in closet, dressing area. Whether it’s a ground-level addition, a basement remodel, or a second-floor addition, accessing rough-ins for plumbing will vary and affect pricing.</span></p>
<h4>High-end primary suite addition costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a 32&#8242; x 20&#8242; primary suite with a separate sitting area and large primary bath over a crawl space, costs are around </span><b>$553 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">psf or </span><b>$359,232</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This kind of project includes custom shelving, built-in storage, as well as a walk-in closet and dressing area with windows.</span></p>
<h3>Basement renovation costs in Chicago</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A starting budget for a basement is around </span><b>$100</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf. At the low end, average renovation costs are around </span><b>$40,000, </b>which<span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes a bathroom with a shower. Flooring options can vary significantly, including laminate, vinyl, engineered wood, porcelain tile, or stained concrete. At the high end, a project for </span><b>$75,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may include a 5&#8242; x 8&#8242;-foot bathroom with a shower, a wet bar, and flooring in an overall space measuring 20&#8242; x 30&#8242;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/basement/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement renovation</a> can be affected by multiple factors. Consider the existing condition of the space, if plumbing pipes need to be installed or moved, if new water service is required and if bracing needs to be done to eliminate structural supports in the middle of a space. Also take into consideration ceiling height, since Chicago basements are typically 8 feet or less, and as low as 6’7″. If you want to raise the ceiling, that requires digging out and underpinning the foundation. In addition, it’s necessary to assure the space is waterproof. A perimeter drain tile system is installed (repaired or extended). Connecting it to a sump pump also is important to consider, and this cost can start at around </span><b>$2,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3>Chicago remodeling costs for permits</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The permit process for renovating varies from Chicago to its suburbs, with each of the village’s or town’s governing bodies determining requirements and fees. In Chicago, permits are obtained through the Building Department. The issue in common is safety and compliance with building codes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Winnetka, remodeling permits cost </span><b>$30</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per </span><b>$1,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of construction; new construction is </span><b>$1.30</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per square foot of new gross area. There also are permit fees for plumbing, electrical service (</span><b>$9,800</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 200 amp service; </span><b>$21,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 400 amp service), furnace, and AC as well as roofing and pools. In Hinsdale, the permit fee for remodeling is calculated on two percent of the value of construction.  In addition, expect to pay permit fees for demolition (</span><b>$3,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Chicago, applications for building permits must include architectural drawings and names of all licensed contractors—plumbers, electricians, HVAC contractors (usually supplied by the general contractor). There is no one size fits all. But expect to pay between </span><b>$1,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>$2,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> minimally for a whole house remodel, major kitchen, and/or bath. The larger the project, the more the fee, ranging to as high as </span><b>$10,000.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also an Easy Permit Program for small projects that do not require architectural drawings (usually available the same day). There are nominal costs (a few hundred dollars for plumbing and electrical permits), which usually are pulled by those contractors.</span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639639880629"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does it cost to remodel a house in Chicago?</u></strong> </strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">If you’re doing a gut renovation in Chicago, budget from $100—$200 per square foot (costs will be lower for a non-gut). For any renovation, wet rooms—spaces with plumbing, like kitchens and bathrooms—will cost more than dry rooms. Materials and finish level will heavily impact costs. Budget-conscious Chicago homeowners should consider big-box stores for savings, while those with bigger budgets may opt for fully custom features or foreign-sourced items.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639639894139"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does a kitchen remodel cost in Chicago?</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Chicago homeowners will likely spend $22,000—$31,000+ for a budget-level kitchen remodel. A mid-range Chicago kitchen remodel will start near $30,000 for 100 square feet of space; while larger kitchens (200 square feet) will cost between $60,000—$80,000. For a luxury kitchen remodel in Chicago, costs can increase to $80,000—$160,000 for a fully-custom, gut-renovated space with premium finishes.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639639907704"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does it cost to remodel a bathroom in Chicago?</u></strong></strong></p>

For a mid-grade bathroom remodel, costs will start between $21,000—$28,000+. A smaller (35 square foot) high-end bathroom remodel could cost about $30,000, but larger bathrooms (approximately 200 square feet) can easily cost $80,000+.</p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that every professional contractor will want to have a detailed conversation with you. They will also inspect your home before developing an estimate specific to your needs and wants.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Do not wait! Some sectors are experiencing a backlog in the supply of materials. For L.A. homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. Additionally, you’ll want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up, and your material order starts at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h3>Remodeling costs per square foot in Los Angeles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no secret that Los Angeles is one of the pricier real estate markets in the United States. However, the housing stock in the area is fairly new. As a result, L.A. homes won’t experience behind-the-wall issues that are often found in older structures. Kitchens and baths are the most popular renovation types. Exterior upgrades and garage conversions are also on the rise to create additional living space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When starting the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process in a whole house</a>, on average, many of our projects can range from </span><b>$100</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><b>$400+</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf. Typically, dry rooms (i.e., living rooms and bedrooms) are cheaper to renovate than wet rooms (i.e., kitchen and baths), and is</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated that while <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updating living rooms or bedrooms</a>—dry rooms—are at the lower end of the range, the wet rooms are closer to </span><b>$400</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf to start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing to note: While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote.</span></p>
<h3>Interior designer costs in Los Angeles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also checked in with L.A.-based</span><a href="https://www.haleyweidenbaum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interior designer Haley Weidenbaum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on how interior designers calculate fees. She explains, “Typically for renovation projects, I will charge a flat fee. This is beneficial for both designer and client. It allows the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/home-interior-design-trends-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designer to work</a> more freely and offers more transparency between the designer and the client. However, it is important for both parties to agree on a scope of work. Everyone should be on the same page and understand what is included under this flat fee.”</span></p>
<h3>How much a Los Angeles kitchen remodel costs per square foot</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing for a kitchen remodel</a>, remember that California banned the running of new gas lines to any new construction—which means no gas stoves. This move is essential in the lowering of the carbon footprint. Even though buildings with existing gas lines aren’t affected, be sure to check the latest codes. If you’re looking to renovate for resale, you don’t want to invest in appliances that aren’t in compliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The logistics of storage and delivery make the cost of cabinets in L.A. less expensive than more densely populated urban areas. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen remodeling costs</a>: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at </span><b>$24,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 200 square feet. The finishes would be budget-friendly from retailers such as Home Depot. This budget includes budget finishes, energy-efficient appliances, laminate countertops, and mid-grade sink and faucet finishes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-grade kitchen remodeling costs: We have seen Sweeten project costs come in at </span><b>$37,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At this budget, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refreshing a kitchen</a> can include new stock or semi-custom cabinets, appliances, and manufactured or quartz countertops.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-end kitchen: Projects on the higher end of the scale can start at <strong>$76,000</strong>. A large part of that cost can be in custom cabinetry. </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5589#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractors Anna and Vahik</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimate that a high-end renovation averages upwards of </span><b>$100,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>How much a Los Angeles bathroom remodel costs per square foot</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget bathroom: A <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget bathroom renovation</a> at 35 square feet, including demo, plumbing work, and new finishes, starts at </span><b>$18,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and can reach </span><b>$25,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the Sweeten contractors. Bathrooms in this category typically lean on big-box stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot to source the majority of materials.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom in Los Angeles</a> will cost on average between </span><b>$28,500</b><b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> According to the Cost vs. Value Report, the cost is </span><b>$849</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf or <strong>$29,744</strong> for a 35-square-foot bathroom. All fixtures are replaced featuring solid-surface vanity and integrated sink, recessed medicine cabinet with light, ceramic tile floor, and a 30” x 60” tub.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-end bathroom: The average cost Sweeten contractors report working on for upscale bathrooms start around </span><b>$40,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Cost vs Value Report puts a high-end bathroom renovation and expansion at </span><b>$88,491. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is based on a bathroom expanded from 35 to 100 square feet. It worked out to be </span><b>$770</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the highest budget, clients are looking at faucets that can cost </span><b>$2,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per piece, marble flooring, custom vanities, built-in medicine cabinets, a rain shower, and top-of-the-line lighting fixtures. As a result, those pricey finishing materials can amount to half the budget. Whether it is budget or high-end, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good general contractor can work</a> with a reasonable budget and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a strategy for the bath remodel</a>.</span></p>
<h3>How much a Los Angeles master suite addition costs</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-grade master suite addition: For approximately </span><b>$503</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf or </span><b>$193,390</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can build a 24’ x 16’ master suite including a walk-in closet, dressing area, freestanding tub, separate shower, and double vanity over an existing crawl space, according to Cost v. Value Report. This pricing includes carpeting in the bedroom and tile on the bathroom floor, lighting throughout, and an exhaust fan.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crawl space and a raised foundation make it easier for the crew to crawl underneath the subfloor to access the rough connections. It becomes more challenging and expensive when working on a renovation with a house on a slab on grade. If fixtures are being relocated or saw cuts, trenching, and backfill are required, then these can add to the cost of the renovation.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upscale master suite addition: For approximately </span><b>$606</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf, or </span><b>$388,427</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s possible to create a 32’ x 20’ master suite with a separate sitting area and a large master bath, also over crawl space, according to the Cost v. Value Report. This includes custom shelving and built-in storage, as well as a walk-in closet and dressing area with windows. The bath has everything that is included in a mid-grade remodel, along with stone counters and a partitioned space for a toilet. The suite also features a wet bar with microwave, sink, and refrigerator for this budget range.</span></li>

<h3>How much do Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) cost in Los Angeles?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ADU is a secondary housing unit on a single-family residential lot. They tend to be adjacent to a primary housing unit, and are usually much smaller than the average home. You can learn more</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building ADUs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as the numerous new laws passed in 2016 and 2019 that are encouraging their proliferation in California by making them faster, easier, and more efficient to build.</span></p>
<h4>Existing electrical and plumbing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractors</a> have worked on projects that range from about <strong>$50,000</strong> to over <strong>$200,000</strong>, depending on whether they are conversions or ground-up constructions. There are numerous other factors that come into play. Importantly, what you have to work with is key—are you converting an existing structure that has electrical and/or plumbing? If so, it could be a relatively affordable proposition. Sweeten contractors Anna &amp; Vahik tell us that in Los Angeles County, conversions average about <strong>$75,000</strong> while ground-up constructions start at a range between <strong>$125,000</strong> to <strong>$150,000</strong>.</span></p>
<h4>Converting garages</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The specifics of an ADU conversion will cause a wide variance in the costs associated with bringing it to compliance. Some Sweeten contractors have been able to convert garages to ADUs with a <strong>$58,000 </strong>budget, which already had plumbing (sewer) and its own electrical service. Another old garage was completely converted costing about <strong>$196,000</strong>. </span></p>
<h3>Costs for remodeling permits in Los Angeles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of permits changes from town to town in Los Angeles. However, typically the cost will be determined by your budget and require a bit of high school math to figure out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Sweeten contractors in L.A., this number varies between an estimated </span><b>$750</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><b>$2,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> depending on the specific scope of work for each project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractors Anna and Vahik explains, “Permit costs vary for different neighborhoods. Average kitchen and bath remodels (“express permits”) with no structural changes or layout changes cost around </span><b>$500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><b>$1,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Bigger projects such as additions, remodels with structural changes, or exterior work that need plan changes start at </span><b>$5,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and can go up to </span><b>$20,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in cities like Santa Monica.”</span></p>

A full-service design/build general contracting firm can also offer comprehensive architectural services.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">After your plans are complete, you will use them to find a general contractor that meets your needs. If your project requires an architect, your <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractor may also be able to refer one. </span><span class="s1">The most successful projects will use an architect and contractor that have worked together before and complement each other’s work.</span></p><p class="p5">Here, <span class="s2">we</span> lay out the full details on when your project will need an architect and how much you should expect to pay. <span class="s1">Our vetted contractors can help homeowners access different levels of architectural services and architects. </span></p><h3 class="p5">You’ll need an architect when the DOB requires signed plans</h3><p class="p5">First, your city/building may require you to use one. Are you are making any significant changes that require the involvement of your Department of Buildings? If so, then you&#8217;ll need an architect to make applications and pull permits. As architect Shannon Reid of <a href="https://rwa.nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">Reid Wilson Architects</span></a> told us, “<span class="s4">Each jurisdiction has a clear delineation on what types of projects require a licensed professional to sign and seal the drawings. NYC is more restrictive than most, and homeowners may find an architect is required due to DOB regulations.” </span></p><h3 class="p8">You’ll need an architect if the remodel affects walls, electrical, and plumbing</h3><p class="p8"><span class="s5">“</span>An architect is generally required when a remodel requires the removing or relocation of walls,” as architect John Kim of <a href="http://kmystudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">Kimoy Studios</span></a> told us.</p><p class="p8">If walls are being moved, your remodel will likely “affect plumbing counts or locations,” and require city, as well as co-op/condo board approvals, as architect Steven Harper of <a href="https://www.mndpc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">MNDPC</span></a> explained.</p><h3 class="p8">You’ll need an architect if you want a professional to manage the project</h3><p class="p8">According to Shannon, “Architects often act as owner’s representatives during the construction phase.” Also, “&#8230;during construction, the architect follows the project to make sure the contractor is following the drawings and the end result is what the homeowner has approved.&#8221;</p><p class="p8">All that said, “architects are essentially professional problem solvers, so any remodel or modification could benefit from the advice or services an architect can offer,” said architect Steven.</p><h3 class="p10">What services do architects offer?</h3><p class="p5">Given the scale of these types of projects, the money spent on architectural services is worth it! One key benefit: architects will project-manage the remodel from start to finish. This is ideal for busy homeowners or those new to remodeling. Additionally, architects use their training to create an optimal and thoughtful design to suit your lifestyle. This guarantees that your new space suits your needs perfectly.</p><p class="p10">When you hire an architect, you can opt for a full suite of services. This includes the following:</p><p><img decoding="async" title="hire-architect-project-graph" class="alignnone wp-image-31023 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a.jpg" alt="when to hire an architect project graph" width="1032" height="552" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a.jpg 1032w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a-300x160.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1032px) 100vw, 1032px" /></p><h3 class="p10">How much does an architect cost?</h3><p class="p5">That sounds great, you say! But how much will it cost? For residential remodels, architects typically charge a percentage of the construction cost of a project. In major urban areas like New York City, this is typically between 15-20 percent for a project costing under $100,000. Large or costly projects budgeted above $250,000 or more can sometimes be billed at a lower percentage, between 10-15 percent.</p><p class="p5">When it comes to permit fees or application fees, they are either required fixed fees or are based on the cost of construction. <span class="s6">These vary based on location but in general, once a project is under construction, additional fees might be paid to the Department of Buildings.</span> Expect fees if you change the plans and the application needs to be amended, or if the construction time is extended.</p><p class="p11"><span class="s8">The cost of an expediter is often minimal when working with the Department of Buildings in towns outside city limits (you don’t usually need one). </span>It’s not uncommon to be able to walk into the buildings department of smaller towns and obtain the information you’re looking for without an expediter.</p><p class="p5">Some architects may charge a fixed rate, an hourly rate, or a cost per square foot. However, these fee structures are less common for full-service residential remodel projects.</p><h3 class="p10">Can I hire an architect for standalone services?</h3><p class="p5">If you do not plan to do a gut remodel, it doesn’t make sense to pay for the full package. However, there are certain situations where you may need an architect for just one part of your project. For example, if <span class="s9">your building requires schematic designs</span> by a registered architect (RA), for a fairly small bathroom project.</p><p class="p5">For those who are willing to provide one-off services, you will typically work out an hourly billing arrangement. Alternately, they may <span class="s10">charge a flat rate based on the time needed to complete it. </span>Some architects do not charge for initial consultations. If they do, they&#8217;ll apply that cost towards the project total if you award the project to them.</p><p class="p8"><span class="s5">Depending on their experience and seniority, a project manager&#8217;s hourly rate will range between $100 to $150. For a principal RA, expect $175 to $250. You can also request a cap on the hourly rate if you need to stay within budget. </span></p><p class="p8"><span class="s5">Architect Steven told us that </span>they typically offer “pre-design services for a modest fee (fixed cost, not hourly) that would include—among other things—a site visit, code review, preliminary budget and schedule estimates, and feasibility. This fee is credited against the fee for our full services if we proceed with a project. However, the deliverables can just as easily be used to engage with another firm if that is a better fit.”</p><p>Do you need an architect for your project?

Materials and techniques used in the project need to be appropriate for the application and won’t fail under normal use. An architect will be needed if a remodeling project involves moving walls or roofs. Their expertise ensures that any changes to an existing structure remain structurally sound. </span></p></div>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Click to read our most up-to-date NYC</span><span class="s2"> </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs here</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs here</a></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With an abundance of Pinterest boards and design blogs, it’s easy to imagine how your dream NYC bathroom could look. If you&#8217;re ready to turn those daydreams into reality, the first crucial step is creating a bathroom remodel budget. To get you started, <span class="s2">Sweeten</span></span><span class="s1"> offers a roadmap of elements that will impact the cost of a bathroom remodel in New York City. Sweeten&#8217;s guide to bathroom remodeling costs, covering building requirements, permits, and design will help nail down your scope and better align real costs with a realistic budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in NYC</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Take a look at the overall average cost to remodel a bathroom in New York City, based on Sweeten renovations:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Budget remodel: Starting at <b>$600 </b>psf (per square feet) or <b>$21,000</b> (based on a 35-sq-ft space)</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Mid-grade remodel: Starting at <b>$700 </b>psf or <b>$24,500 </b>(based on a 35-sq-ft space)</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">High-end remodel: Starting at <b>$850 </b>psf or <b>$68,000 </b>(based on a 80-sq-ft space)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in a bathroom renovation, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices will continue to go up and your material order will start at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Remodeling an NYC bathroom all at once</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While it can be tempting to apply à la carte prices to individual elements of the work, a full bathroom renovation is an integrated process that involves design, materials, installation, and plumbing. If your bathroom has one or two areas of concern, you might decide to swap out an individual fixture or two. You can replace a toilet or vanity or take on some limited retiling and pay solely for the cost of the new fixtures and the hours of installation work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, it can be misleading to break up and price out each step of a bathroom remodel. Even if you are just redoing fixtures and tile work, you may discover that you need to replace the sheetrock on the wall or address issues behind the walls, like old valves and ancient drain pipes. A gut renovation, which addresses the whole bathroom space, allows you to plan more broadly. By doing a gut renovation, you can get more work done, in the right sequence, and more cost-effectively.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Budget to high-end costs for bathroom materials and finishes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Listed below are the visible parts of a bathroom renovation, and probably the aspect you’ve spent the most time thinking about. Review the range of pricing for various fixtures, materials, and finishes in the chart below. On the budget side, you’ll find items sourced from big-box stores like Home Depot, Walmart, or IKEA. Prices increase if you choose to use their interior boxes but upgrade or customize the function or style, such as the door fronts. On the high end are highly customized, handmade, or imported items.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">How much will materials for a bathroom remodel cost?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Wall and floor tile</b>: Budget – <b>$3 per square foot (psf)</b>, Mid-grade – <b>$15 psf</b>, High-end – <b>$35 psf</b> </span></li>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Bathroom remodel costs for permits, design, and everything behind-the-scenes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In contrast to visible upgrade items, there are unavoidable behind-the-scenes investments to consider when creating your budget.</span></p>
<h4>Building requirements impact bathroom remodeling costs</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For those in apartments, building requirements can play a significant role in dictating design and budget needs. These requirements can range from insurance coverage minimums, which limit your ability to work with professionals who aren’t carrying high-value insurance policies, to general <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/nyc-alteration-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">alteration agreements</span></a> that require anyone doing any work in the building to have far-reaching coverage for problems they may never encounter, like asbestos removal or collapse scenarios.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s6">Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC contractor Thomas</a></span><span class="s1"> explained, “Buildings are becoming less flexible on their [insurance] requirements which cause us to raise prices to keep up with those needs.” The contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive requirements tend to have higher operating costs and can meet higher insurance requirements, more stringent debris removal expectations, limited noise and hours-of-work requirements, and stricter parking rules. While there is no exact figure on this, you may see this translate into higher rates overall for teams that can meet those demands. </span></p>
<h4>NYC permit costs for a bathroom remodel</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Plumbing services: <b>$2,000 – $3,500</b> and higher </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Plumbing permits: up to <b>$2,000 </b>and as high as<b> $5,000</b> per permit </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Electrical permits: <b>$900</b> </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Asbestos inspection: <b>$500 </b>to<b> $1,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tackling a NYC bathroom remodel means planning for plumbing services and permits. Any plumbing work that exceeds a minor repair or a direct swap of a similar fixture requires a permit from the City’s Department of Buildings, which can run up to <b>$2,000 </b>and as high as <b>$5,000</b> per permit. Plumbing is a specialized trade that often comes with hourly rates; expect to budget between <b>$2,000 </b>and<b> $3,500</b> (or higher) for a full bathroom remodel.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you’re adding outlets or doing electrical work, an electrical permit may be needed, which can run close to <b>$900</b>. You may also need an asbestos inspection, depending on the building requirements and your plumbing plans, which cost <b>$500 </b>to<b> $1,000</b>.</span></p>
<h4>How design affects bathroom remodel costs</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the design stage, plan to collaborate with the experts you hire to produce detailed drawings that account for all physical elements of the bathroom. A schematic drawing is usually presented to the building board as part of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">approval process</span></a>, which needs to outline the locations of the major fixtures as well as specifications for the vanity and tub/shower, and lighting. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you plan to move the plumbing to convert a bathtub to a shower or vice versa, the permit alone to change the plumbing in NYC is <strong>$6,000</strong>. This is because you’ll need to hire a registered architect to file a permit application certifying that the plan complies with applicable codes and laws. An architect or interior designer will typically charge 15 to 20 percent of the project’s construction costs for his or her fee.</span></p>
<p>Sweeten general contractors can help provide architect referrals for a range of services, saving homeowners a step.</p>
<h4>Demolition and site prep for bathroom renovations</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this stage, labor is needed to ensure that your bathroom renovation maintains its value over time. Old materials and fixtures need to be disposed of, which can be complicated on busy city streets with limited parking. This difficulty will be reflected in the contractor’s rate. Almost without exception, your contractor may need to strip the walls and flooring to frame and level before any installation occurs. This behind-the-scenes step is critical and labor-intensive and can cost an average of <b>$2,000</b>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If your home is new or the sub-floor is concrete, any leveling needs may be minimal. Otherwise, you probably need to account for floor leveling and new drywall or plastering before any surface work can get going.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Exposing the existing conditions inside walls while leveling and framing will also allow your contractor to address plumbing or electrical issues before you hook up a new plumbing fixture. It may be necessary to replace all horizontal plumbing work to the building’s “stack” (the main vertical lines that run throughout the building) and run new wiring to head off plumbing and electrical problems that you may have unwittingly inherited. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You’ll want to factor in costs that support the success and longevity of the work. Examples of this are prep work to protect floors and valuables (which can add <b>$600</b> to<b> $900</b>) and waterproofing steps (which can add <b>$1,000</b>). This is critical for the project’s foundation alignment and infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cGL_uAFyKzE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Installation is the final stage to incorporate all of the bathroom renovation materials you’ve purchased. The craftsmanship involved in the installation of all the pieces will depend on the size of your bathroom and the degree of customization you need to make all of the pieces fit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">PRO TIP: Expect to spend 30 percent or less of your total project cost on visible materials, fixtures, and finishes. The rest will go to behind-the-scenes costs, like labor, permits, and fees.</span></p>
<h3>Behind-the-scenes for a bathroom renovation costs</h3>
<h4>Raw materials for bathroom renovations</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For 2021, Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as the main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts mainly due to Covid-related issues, from what we have seen,&#8221; said <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span>. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;</span></p>
<h4>Overhead costs</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">General contractors always factor in a percentage of the project to cover overhead costs, including insurance, administrative support, and the inevitable costs of growing a business. Sweeten contractors range from two-men crews to much larger entities that employ dozens of staff (including designers, project managers, millworkers and laborers, bookkeepers, and operations staff). No matter the size of your contractor’s business, however, you will absorb some of the cost increases they bear from year to year, though not necessarily dollar for dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s7">Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC contractor Aaron</a> explained that in the last year, there have been specific increases of compliance, certificates, and safety measures imposed on MEP subcontractors (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) by the Department of Buildings leading to higher costs. </span><span class="s1">While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote. </span></p>
<h4><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;bathroom remodeling new york&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:577,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;9&quot;:0,&quot;12&quot;:0}">Bathroom remodeling costs in New York in 2021</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You have a fair amount of choice in deciding what to spend on the material aspects of a bathroom renovation. Less obvious are the costs that are the backbone and labor of the work overall, no matter what you spend on materials.

<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1638353756989"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How much does it cost to remodel a bathroom?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">NYC bathroom renovations typically cost between $600 and $850 per square foot, depending on the level of fixtures and materials used. The finish level available from big-box stores like Home Depot and Ikea will put your renovation at the low end of the price range. Custom, hand-made, and imported specialty materials will push you to the high end.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1638353791087"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How much does it cost to retile a bathroom?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Not counting the cost of demolition (removing old tile and grout), count on paying between $3 and $35 per square foot, depending on the type of tile. Basic ceramic tiles will fall on the low end of this range (~$3 PSF). Most stone tiles, and higher-end ceramic tiles will land in the middle of the range (~$15 PSF). Custom and exotic imported tiles can reach or exceed the high end of the range (~$30+ PSF).</p>

<h2 class="p1">Key factors to convert a garage into living space: costs, climate control, property value &amp; local zoning</h2>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/featured-slider/a-hamptons-bays-beach-house-renovation-gets-a-pop-art-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katy&#8217;s garage conversion</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">into an indoor-outdoor room</span></p>
<p>Increasingly, garages in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are morphing into multi-use spaces. To homeowners, these garage spaces are blank canvases and are morphing into anything from self-contained units to home offices. If you&#8217;re wondering how to convert your garage into a living space, there are some details you&#8217;ll need to gather first.</p>
<p>At Sweeten, we’re here to help you flip that underutilized garage into one of the best rooms in the house or perhaps an income-generating unit. Before you take on turning a garage into living space, like a home gym or guest house, there are things to consider. Does the space have proper insulation?</p>
<p>Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</p>
<h3>Garage remodel ideas</h3>
<p>Anything. Really! Garages have been converted into gyms, personal getaway space, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-contained studio apartments</a>, and home bars, according to Sweeten general contractor Michael. “It’s found space, so get creative,” Michael said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-06.jpg" alt="one part of two car detached garage converted to room and sectional door replaced with see through glass doors during renovation" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone wp-image-50920 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) With Sweeten&#8217;s help, a 150-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-connecticut-garage-renovation-creates-an-art-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage remodel</a> in Connecticut became a ceramics studio</span></p>
<h3>Should you trade in car storage space for a garage remodel?</h3>
<p class="p3">While some people are giving up their car’s indoor space altogether, others are slicing their garage in half, said Michael. This leaves room for at least one car, and the rest of the space becomes something else. “That way you can still have a garage when you sell your house,” he said.</p>
<p class="p3">Michael believes the jury is still out on if the property value increases whether the garage is converted or not. Some Sweeten contractors believe a garage is much more valuable as a living space for the homeowner and for resale purposes. <a href="https://budgeting.thenest.com/making-room-garage-affect-home-value-31778.html"><span class="s2">Reports indicate that a home&#8217;s</span></a> value could increase by as much as six percent, but that’s only if the area has ample street parking. Taking away your garage and off-street parking in a high-density area could bring that value down.</p>
<p class="p3">However, some towns might require at least one car space on your property and potentially two in some areas, Michael said. This could mean slotting your car into an outdoor area somewhere else in your front yard. “Do your homework,” Michael said. More on zoning and permits below.</p>
<h3>How much does it cost to convert a garage into living space?</h3>
<p class="p3">Budgets for a garage renovation can vary greatly depending on many factors including the state of your garage, your intended use, and the types of materials you want to use. To get an accurate read on your budgets, it’s always best to sit down with a general contractor who can tailor a quote for your situation.</p>
<p class="p3">Converting a garage is a good-value strategy to add living space to your home, costing <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/money/real-estate/2017/02/10/renovating-garage-less-costly-option-than-addition/97742930/"><span class="s2">$30 a square foot</span></a> which is less than an extension, according to NorthJersey.com. Sweeten contractor Michael puts the average range of a garage conversion in the tri-state area between $35,000 and $60,000. “But I’ve seen upwards of $100,000,” he said.</p>
<p class="p3">The fit-out for a garage conversion shouldn’t cost more than $45,000 to make the space comfortable, Michael said. That includes plumbing for a toilet, insulation, and heating. However, “A lot of people are putting in bars and fridges, some cooking equipment, or cool decorative wall paneling,” he said. These are just a few examples of what can bump up the price tag.</p>
<p class="p3">A basic garage conversion project that another Sweeten contractor has worked on came in at $25,000. The homeowner wanted an art studio. To handle the new 25 lighting fixtures—art studios need a lot of light—the space required an electrical upgrade including a new breaker box. Insulation was also required so it was comfortable during the fall, spring, and summer. A heater was added for the winter.</p>
<p class="p3">For a $60,000 project in rural New Jersey, a homeowner wanted to add a fully self-contained apartment to the second story of their garage. That meant adding a kitchen and bathroom, which pushes up a budget substantially. Plumbing, electrical, an interior and exterior overhaul as well as reinforcing the exterior stairs were part of the remodel.</p>
<p class="p3">The budget might seem big, but it was an income-generating investment bringing in rental income at $1,400 a month.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg" alt="Garage remodel in los angeles with sofa and office" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52349 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Saima and Tom&#8217;s Sweeten contractor completed their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/adu-and-garage-renovations/a-los-angeles-garage-remodel-with-loft-like-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage conversion in Los Angeles</a></span></p>
<h3>What are the conditions of the garage?</h3>
<p class="p3">Sometimes, you&#8217;ll need to clear those spaces out from junk and any animal tenants. Many underutilized garages, especially standalone structures, may have experienced neglect for a period of time.</p>
<p class="p3">Whether a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/derelict-garage-finds-purpose-she-shed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stand-alone garage is structurally sound</a> will also be a question. This will take on additional importance if you’re renovating or adding a second story.</p>
<p class="p3">Garages can also have random and awkwardly placed columns disrupting the open space, or a ceiling height that isn’t conducive to taller guests. And most floors will be on a pitch so water can run right off it, according to Michael. These are the types of problems that might require a creative solution if you’re going to convert your garage into a living space.</p>
<h3>Consider: Insulation and heating a garage remodel</h3>
<p class="p3">Most garages lack insulation. Consequently, it probably won&#8217;t have heating; so consider what you want to use the space for. If it will be used just for the summer, adding some fans can offer a budget-conscious idea.</p>
<p class="p3">If you’re intending to use it all or most of the year, you will likely need to add insulation and heating in your garage conversion. Typically, garages are made of concrete blocks, so they tend to be very cold. However, a garage that is within your home might have some insulation on any wall or part of the ceiling that connects to the main house.</p>
<p class="p3">Giving the room its own heat source will cost up to $6,000. Keep in mind that a heat pump might require an electrical upgrade. “You can take an existing heat system in the house and blow it into the garage,” said Michael, of one possible solution.</p>
<p class="p3">The floor of a garage is typically concrete and a big source of heat loss. Adding insulation might be necessary. If that’s the case, you will need to dig down or elevate the floor if your ceiling height allows for that, Michael said.</p>
<h3>Zoning and permits needed to convert a garage into living space</h3>
<p class="p3">Unfortunately, zoning rules can get in the way of a garage conversion. This is because changing the use of your garage can be a big deal for some building departments. “Some zoning codes prohibit adding a loft or a second story,” said Michael. The best way forward is to talk with your general contractor to find out what rules your local area might have.</p>
<p class="p3">According to Sweeten contractors, the cost of permits will also change from area to area with a range from a few hundred dollars up to <span class="s2">$1,500</span> if you need permits for electrical, plumbing, and HVAC.</p>
<p class="p3">“Home Owners Associations often frown on these conversions,” Michael added. That’s because you will be taking away a car (or two) which might have been a vital part of that development’s original approval he said. If your home comes under an HOA, make sure to check their rules! It&#8217;s also wise to check the zoning and permitting restrictions in your area.</p>
<h3>Questions to ask when turning a garage into a living space</h3>
<p class="p3">Ultimately, homeowners interested in turning a garage into a living space should do some soul searching first. How much will it improve your quality of life? Will you rent it? How will it impact your property’s value? For many, a garage is worth more as a living space than it is as car storage. <span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your garage or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s easy to save on remodeling costs in Atlanta when you know a few tricks</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49255 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen and dining area" width="1600" height="1068" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta.jpg 1600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You love your home, and you love living in Atlanta. But there may be <em>some</em> parts of your home that you don&#8217;t love. Or maybe you just bought a new home, and you know you want to update it to suit you. We see renovation projects in Atlanta at a wide range of costs. Often, homeowners want to maximize their scope on a minimal budget. Luckily, there are a handful of tricks that can help you save on remodeling in Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Remodel smaller and smarter</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For years, one of the draws of living in Atlanta was that you could own a large house for the same—or less than—what you would pay in northern cities. Atlanta <a href="https://atlanta.curbed.com/2018/10/3/17931250/lending-tree-report-atlanta-houston-biggest-houses-nation"><span class="s2">ranks number two</span></a> in the United States in home sizes. In fact, Atlanta’s average home size is just under 2,000 square feet. But sprawl has its price, which means large homes and large remodels come with higher costs. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Find ways to remodel that don’t involve creating a new foundation or building upward. If you can, stay within the existing footprint of the house. Explore rooms that are no longer used for their intended purpose and convert them. Tour the house with your contractor and find walls that you can open to expand two rooms into one large room.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Look into Atlanta&#8217;s green remodeling incentives</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Green or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eco-friendly remodeling</a> helps the environment and can certainly help you save on remodeling in Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many homeowners may not realize that they can take advantage of a host of <a href="https://www.nariatlanta.org/green-remodeling"><span class="s2">green remodeling incentives</span></a>. These incentives can reduce the cost of remodeling. Some of the incentives include tax credits, loan programs, tax exemptions, and rebates.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Speak to your contractor about your interest in green remodeling. You may also want to have an energy audit done before remodeling begins.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Tailor the HVAC to Atlanta&#8217;s weather</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Heating and cooling are different in Atlanta than in other cities. Systems that work in Chicago, Los Angeles, or New York aren’t always applicable in Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In a city with fewer than 50 days per year below freezing, Atlanta homes don&#8217;t need the kind of robust furnaces or heat pumps found in other areas of the country. And maxing out your A/C isn’t always the answer, either! Your A/C should be tailored specifically to Atlanta’s weather and to your own house. Also, it&#8217;s smart to explore passive cooling methods with your contractor.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Make use of Georgia’s solar power and natural light</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Atlanta is one of the sunniest cities in the United States, with at least 60% of the days per year being sunny. Use this to your advantage! Concentrate on improving windows on the south side of your house. Rooms that have plenty of large windows rely less on artificial light. This saves money on electricians’ costs and on the cost of extensive artificial lighting. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At the same time, make sure that these windows have low-e solar coating. Add draperies to block sun during the brightest part of the day.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Remodel with mold in mind</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Atlanta can get humid—extremely humid. Humidity that reaches 55% or more can lead to mold growth. Poorly vented crawlspaces, basements, and rooms are susceptible to mold growth. Not all mold is dangerous. However, some mold can be a lung irritant and can affect those with respiratory ailments.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Good remodeling work can be quickly undone by mold. To avoid mold growth, talk to your contractor about mold-inhibiting wall and ceiling systems, along with venting systems.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Refurbish, don’t replace</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The days of tearing out everything and replacing it wholesale are long gone. Now, there is a smarter approach to remodeling that incorporates fixing items, not throwing them out. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For example, you may decide to reface, rather than replace, your kitchen cabinets. Refurbishing cabinets, tubs, showers, floors, walls, and more keep these items out of the landfill and make your Atlanta remodel more affordable. </span></p>
<p><em>Considering new doors for your kitchen cabinets? Get the lowdown on <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/the-411-on-kitchen-cabinet-door-designs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different cabinet door styles.</a></em></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">DIY projects in an Atlanta remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Not all of the work of your home remodel project needs to be done by the contractor’s workers. You can do a few things yourself in advance, or during downtimes. Sweat equity helps you save on remodel costs and make it all more affordable. Always coordinate in advance with your contractor if you plan to do DIY work. (Here’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/diy-vs-contractor/"><span class="s2">what you can DIY</span></a> and what should be left to the pros!)</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Use durable imitation materials</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You might really want that exotic hardwood flooring, but the price of it isn&#8217;t within your budget. Look for wood-look ceramic tile planks that look just like mahogany or other overseas hardwoods. Laminate and vinyl plank also look remarkably like real wood. Quartz and laminate countertops reliably imitate expensive marbles and granites. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Wherever there is an expensive material, there is likely a far less expensive imitation material that you can use in your remodel.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Keep the plumbing in place</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One rule of thumb for keeping bathroom and kitchen remodeling affordable: avoid moving the plumbing, if possible.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Whenever you move plumbing around, remodel costs rise. This doesn&#8217;t mean that you cannot change your shower, bathtub, or sink. You <i>can</i> replace or refurbish these items while keeping the core plumbing system where it is</span><span class="s3">.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Shop around for the best contractor</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Finding the best contractor for a remodeling project in Atlanta isn&#8217;t about finding the cheapest person. Instead, it&#8217;s about finding a person who can best bring your vision to light. </span><span class="s1">Concentrate on finding a contractor who best matches your needs. You’ll also want to find a contractor who you work with well, and who you communicate well with. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Get on the general contractor’s schedule—now</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When you sign with a contractor for a home remodeling project, the contractor places you on their calendar. Being in the early queue means getting ahead of other clients, especially when there is overall high demand for home remodeling, labor, and materials. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Ask your expert for remodeling advice</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One of the upsides of hiring a general contractor is that you can take advantage of their knowledge and expertise. </span><span class="s1">Feel free to ask for their advice&#8230;that’s why you hired them! Contractors can have years or decades of experience in construction and the right one will help you match your scope to your budget.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider <em>all</em> of the materials (not just the tile itself!) plus labor to get a true picture of what it&#8217;ll cost to tile a bathroom</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49028" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3.jpg" alt="tiling costs" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When budgeting for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/measure-for-bathroom-tile-accurately-what-youll-need-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bathroom tiling project</a>, it&#8217;s easy to become focused on the cost of the tile itself. After all, tile is at the heart of the project; it’s the main look of all of this. However, crucial (and often overlooked) steps like prep and time for labor can impact how much it&#8217;ll cost you to tile a bathroom. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In this guide, Sweeten outlines three categories that go into the cost to tile a bathroom: <strong>prep</strong>, <strong>materials</strong>, and <strong>labor</strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Tiling prep work</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Before beginning the tile project, a number of items in the bathroom must be removed. After they have been removed, the subfloor must be assessed.</span></p>
<h4>Using ceramic tile in your bathroom?</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ceramic tile requires a stable base (substrate) that is rigid and does not bend. The bathroom’s existing subfloor should either be strong enough or it should be strengthened. For natural stone tile, the industry group <a href="https://www.ceramictilefoundation.org/homeowners-guide-to-hiring-qualified-tile-installer#chapter-3"><span class="s2">Ceramic Tile Education Foundation</span></a> (CTEF) recommends that the substrate be twice as rigid as for tiling with ceramics or porcelains. If the substrate is not smooth enough, it may require an additional layer of underlayment.</span></p>
<h4>Removing bathroom items</h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Toilet: The toilet must always be removed before tiling a floor. The toilet will either be replaced, or a new toilet may be installed.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Baseboards: Wall baseboards and any type of horizontal wall molding that touches the floor must be removed before tiling.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Door casing: Door casing—the vertical trim that forms a door frame—usually doesn&#8217;t need to be removed. Tile workers can cut the bottom of the casing and fit the tile underneath.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Shower/bathtub and bathroom cabinet: Showers, tubs, sink cabinets, and any permanent pieces do not need to be removed. However, sometimes they are removed during a full bathroom remodel.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Preparing (or repairing) the subfloor</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When installing tile in a remodeled bathroom, it is common to find a damaged subfloor. This damage tends to be concentrated around the toilet, sink, and shower/bathtub. If you are removing the shower or bath, you may find even more damage under the shower pan or bathtub.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sometimes, large sections of the subfloor may need to be removed and replaced with a new subfloor. In some cases, the damage may extend to the floor joists (the beams below the subfloor). Both of these fixes are separate from the tiling.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you are working with a general contractor, the contractor will remove all of the necessary items and make repairs. This prep work should be done ahead of time before the tile subcontractor begins.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While removing items is heavily a labor cost, some materials may figure in. This depends on the scale of the project. For example, large projects may require the rental of a dumpster. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Raw materials for prepping</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Though tile is the most visible feature of bathroom tile, a support system of other materials makes a bathroom tile surface possible. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Subfloor prep materials</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Solid subfloor: Exterior-grade, tongue-and-groove plywood is a standard subfloor material.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Underlayment on top of subfloor: Many tile pros recommend laying down an additional layer of thin cement board on top of the subfloor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Leveling compound: Dips in the subfloor can be corrected with a liquid leveling compound. Poured directly onto the subfloor, this compound is self-leveling. It fills gaps up to 1-1/2-inch deep.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Tiling materials</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Thin-set: Thin-set is the mortar base that is applied under the tile.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Grout: Grout is the filler that is applied to the joints between the tiles.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Grout tint: Grout usually comes in a few variations of gray, black, cream, or white. But grout can also be tinted to nearly any color you desire.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Grout sealant: Grout is porous and must be sealed to prevent moisture infiltration.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Haze remover: A light haze remains from the grouting process. A liquid haze remover is needed to clean this up.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Optional materials</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Uncoupling material: When installing tile on concrete, many tile professionals recommend that you use a special material to avoid cracking. An uncoupling material disconnects the tile from the concrete slab. This prevents concrete from transmitting cracks to the tile. <a href="https://www.ceramictilefoundation.org/homeowners-guide-to-hiring-qualified-tile-installer#chapter-3"><span class="s2">CTEF recommends</span></a> that all concrete floors with pre-existing cracks be installed with uncoupling material.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Radiant heating: To combat cold tile floors, many homeowners opt for radiant heating underneath the tile. This electrically operated mesh is embedded in the thin-set mortar. It is controlled by a wall thermostat.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Time and cost of labor</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many types of home projects are DIY-friendly. But tilework is a long-established, highly skilled craft that can be tricky for many DIYers to master. So, hiring pros to expertly lay the tile pays for itself many times over.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If the cost of tiling materials (thin-set, grout, etc.) is not broken out in an estimate, it may be included in the labor cost. If so, it will be noted as such.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One more factor that affects the cost of tile installation labor is the need for the tile contractor to return several times to the job site. After setting the tile, workers must allow at least 24 hours before returning for grouting. After grouting, workers must wait at least another 4 hours before returning to remove the grout haze. </span><span class="s1">All consults and the clean-up are usually included in the installation cost.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Choosing the style and color of your bathroom tile is an exciting remodeling step. But as you now know, there are many other factors that can impact the total cost to tile a bathroom. Knowing those factors will give you a leg up in understanding the bottom-line total cost when discussing the project with your contractor. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>COVID-19 brings opportunities if you want to remodel your home, but you’ll need to know how to navigate</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48721 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4.jpg" alt="Image of a room in the middle of painting" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>When the global pandemic of 2020 hit, few homeowners were thinking about home remodeling. Yet as the pandemic wore on, life returned to (some) idea of normal and home remodeling once again became a topic. It was top of mind for homeowners who had already started a remodel before COVID-19 spread. Homeowners who had only considered remodeling also started to plan their projects in earnest.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to remodeling, COVID-19 has impacted material costs and changed the supply chain. Sweeten outlines what a homeowner might expect to encounter while taking on a remodel during COVID-19, and how to navigate those obstacles to get your renovation plans back on track.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>We&#8217;re noticing our homes in new ways, every day</h3>
<p>Homeowners now spend more time than ever at home. Flaws that were merely annoying with that bathroom or kitchen are now magnified. Homeowners who only wondered if their home was ready for a remodel now know.</p>
<p>This need isn’t just imaginary, either. More people at home means that renovation is a necessity. Even if only a couple of people live there, everything in the house is being used more often.</p>
<h3>Savings from 2020 allow for renovations in 2021</h3>
<p>The pandemic has hit many people hard—the job market, businesses, people’s health. Some homeowners have been lucky, and employers have found ways to keep workers employed from home.</p>
<p>However, there is a rare upside to the COVID-19 pandemic for some Americans. Many homeowners’ expenses have shrunk dramatically. What has contributed to this? With less driving, gas and vehicle expenses drop. Less dining out and entertaining means lighter credit card bills. Vacation plans have been canceled.</p>
<p>This has caught many experts by surprise, too. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies had previously predicted a slowdown in home remodeling in 2021. But as 2020 wore on, the group revised its prediction. They now<a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/home-remodeling-set-stronger-growth-2021"> indicate that home remodeling</a> is going stronger than ever, with a projected uptick in home renovation and repair spending from 2020 to 2021.</p>
<p>Indeed, at Sweeten, we saw an increase in home renovation projects. Our fourth quarter saw 110% growth year-over-year from 2019 to 2020. The trend is continuing into 2021 as well, with 99% growth for January 2021 vs. 2020. We attribute this growth to homeowners realizing their homes need to be so much more than a place to just sleep. More than ever, we&#8217;ve needed our homes to provide us space for work, play, self-care, and recovery.</p>
<h3>Act fast, or prepare to wait for building materials</h3>
<p>Homeowners intent on remodeling may find themselves blocked due to a severe slowdown in the supply of materials. In many sectors, the manufacturing of building materials drastically slowed or came to a complete stop. Even if manufacturers are functioning again, they are doing so at a reduced capacity due to social distancing.</p>
<p>The pandemic shows how much the U.S. depends on overseas building products like lumber, roofing, and windows. For one, many homes’ kitchen and bathroom remodels use ceramic and porcelain tile. However, over<a href="https://www.floorcoveringweekly.com/main/topnews/2019-us-ceramic-tile-market-update-29623"> 81% of U.S. tile</a> comes from China, Mexico, Spain, Italy, and Brazil. Both Spain and Italy were hard hit particularly by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Home centers are ordering up to 300% more product due to the high level of DIY home repairs and remodels. This has a significant impact on the supply chain for builders.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Don&#8217;t wait! For homeowners interested in renovating, it&#8217;s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up.</p>
<h3>Labor lag-time is a reality</h3>
<p>Soon after the pandemic hit, over<a href="https://www.agc.org/sites/default/files/Files/Communications/Recap_Current_Construction_Business_Conditions_Final.pdf"> 25% of building projects</a> came to an immediate halt or were delayed, according to an industry group. For any homeowner thinking of a remodel, this means that all other projects in the queue must come first.</p>
<p>Even materials that are acquired and on-site do no good unless there are workers to install them. Workers who have had to tend to family members affected by COVID-19 have left the workforce or even the U.S. At the same time, other workers who are eager to work have filled in the vacuum.</p>
<h3>Tips on handling your COVID-19 remodel project</h3>
<p>The future is unclear, but one thing is certain: COVID-19’s effects are long-lasting. Even after vaccines are widely dispensed, there will be an effect in building and remodeling. Here&#8217;s what proactive homeowners can do to position themselves well for a remodel during COVID-19 recovery.</p>
<h4>Book a contractor now</h4>
<p>The desire to remodel has increased, and in many markets, demand outstrips supply. If you delay speaking to a contractor, you’ll have<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/16/what-you-can-do-now-plan-manage-home-renovation-once-conditions-are-right/?arc404=true"> even more orders</a> jump into the line ahead of you. With vaccines being widely distributed, there will only be more people booking a contractor. Begin setting up appointments to meet general contractors for site visits.</p>
<h4>Conduct virtual site-visits</h4>
<p>Sweeten offers a streaming video conference on the platform. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-renovate-safely-with-a-virtual-site-visit/">virtual site visit replaces</a> both the general contractor’s walk-through of the property and the face-to-face conference between contractor and homeowner.</p>
<p>If done effectively, it can give the contractor enough information to begin drawing up an estimate. This allows for both parties to safely review the renovation project virtually, without meeting in person.</p>
<p>Take note: a physical site visit will need to be done at some point for the contractor to take their own measurements and account for every detail. Virtual site visits are a good option, however, if an initial in-person site visit isn’t possible or safe.</p>
<h4>Expect higher costs, but shop smartly for savings</h4>
<p>Some<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/always-expect-home-remodeling-to-cost-50-percent-more-take-50-percent-longer-finance-expert.html"> experts predict</a> that home remodeling not only will take longer but will cost up to 50% more than in pre-pandemic times. Don&#8217;t worry: this gives motivated homeowners the chance to shop for items on their own. Make sure to seek the best possible prices out there, and select your contractor carefully.</p>
<h4>Make the most of your space with clever design</h4>
<p>Speaking early on to a general contractor or designer will help you solidify your ideas. Hone your design with care and avoid waste.</p>
<p>The transformation of under-utilized spaces is a trend here to stay. Basements, attics, or garages are performing in new ways. At Sweeten, we&#8217;re seeing attics turn into places for children to learn and play. Basements are mostly getting turned into gyms. Garages are becoming studios or offices that could be rented out in the future.</p>
<p>With multiple family members at home during the day, the installation of glass panels has gained traction. People aren’t looking for visual separation—they need acoustic separation when working from home.</p>
<p>Outdoor spaces and outdoor kitchens will be popular. It’s unknown if we’ll still be social distancing through the summer. Being able to host the whole event outside, not having to run back and forth inside, makes the event a better experience.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s no surprise that baths are topping many remodeling lists these days. In Houston, real estate comes in a variety of architectural styles, from French Country and bungalow to Queen Anne and ranch. Plus, b</span><span class="s1">ath trends today cover a range of décor styles that are compatible with your home’s architecture. For those considering their own small bathroom renovation in Houston, here are the need-to-knows and items to plan for before you begin.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are your goals for your bathroom renovation?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For most people doing small bathroom renovations, updating the bathroom design is the #1 priority. Who doesn’t welcome a glow-up, especially in the bathroom? Modernizing dated cabinetry and hardware, and installing more stylish faucets are go-to options. So is swapping out a tub for a shower. Or, upgrading the shower with a thermostatic system with integrated volume control. Maybe your luxury shower dreams include multiple body sprays and a rain shower! Many homeowners opt to remove old, tired </span><span class="s1">for a refreshed version. Another key focus in bathroom renovations is adding extra storage. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are your needs?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s easier to figure out. Who will use the bath? In a medium-sized bath, do you prefer a tub or shower? Single or double vanity? Take clear notes on any must-have features in your bath. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Budgeting for a bath remodel in Houston </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To help you sort it out, here is what you can expect to pay in Houston, on average. Retaining the footprint in a mid-range bathroom remodel in Houston starts at around $15,000, up to $25,000. Costs will vary based on the materials used, as well as the complexity of installation. For example, a mosaic backsplash is more affordable when the tiles are installed on a sheet. Micro mini tiles installed individually will be more labor-intensive—and more expensive. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Materials costs can vary greatly as well, with super affordable options available at big box stores, versus high-end imported tile companies. A powder room may slide into a slightly lower entry-level for costs, but again, it depends on the materials you choose! <em>Read more about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/2020-cost-guide-for-a-home-remodel-in-houston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home renovation costs for Houston.</a></em></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are you likely to recoup in value?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sixty percent, according to <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost Vs Value</a> report for Houston. Or, almost $12,000; based on a 5-by-7 foot bath that costs around $19,000 or $542 psf. This includes a new 30-by-60 inch porcelain-on-steel bathtub, new single-lever temperature, and pressure-balanced shower control, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How long does a Houston bathroom renovation take?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Sweeten contractors, construction time averages about two to three weeks. However: <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planning, executing, and finishing</a> can take six weeks to three months—depending on the size and complexity of your project.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to get the most bang for the buck</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When your space is dimensionally challenged (read: small), and you don’t have the room or budget to expand, you still have plenty of options. One way is to create the illusion of more space, by doing one or more of the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Use wall-mounted vanities and toilets.  That extra floor space opens up the room.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Another space enhancer: a solid surface vanity counter with an integral sink.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Install a wall-to-wall mirror behind a long vanity or an oversized round mirrors. Mirrors visually expand space. Some streamlined designs incorporate medicine cabinets.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A classic pedestal sink also is visually slimming. Modern washstands, usually in metal frames, are on-trend options, especially white on black. More traditional sinks with turned console legs offer additional metal choices, like brass or polished nickel.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Building in storage wherever you can tuck in shelves for towels and essentials. Recessed niches in the shower for shampoo and conditioner also are smart.  </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Swap a tub for a roomy walk-in shower with an all-glass frame. If there’s a window, natural light will flow through, visually boosting the dimensions of the space.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why should you consider neutrals in the bathroom? </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many homeowners opt for white and beige in baths because it’s safe. But that doesn’t mean it has to be boring! Designers use a few tricks of the trade to keep neutrals feel fresh. One trick is the magic of tone-on-tone—but with nuances. (That means mixing different shades of neutral, from light to dark.) Another trick is to pair neutrals with different textures.  Get this look by pairing a dimensional wallcovering or an embossed tile with a polished or smooth surface.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding color to a bathroom </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We love when homeowners go bold in the bathroom and <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/life/home/design/article/35-ideas-to-amp-up-your-bathroom-s-style-15404821.php#photo-19670294" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">color outside the lines</a>. Some argue that vibrant colors can take over smaller spaces, like powder rooms. But others feel that’s the perfect venue for bold cobalt or emerald, a spicy tangerine, or saffron. Precisely <em>because</em> it’s a small space, you can afford to be dramatic—and even splurge on faucets and towel holders, plus lighting and a fancy wallcovering.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Color doesn&#8217;t need to be limited to walls: consider the countertop or the vanity. Blues and greens—bright and pale—are gaining traction in traditional, country, and modern styles.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Comparing bathroom remodeling materials</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stone has some hefty competition these days from porcelain tile. Porcelain is not confined to small format 4-, 6- or 12-inch tiles. Porcelain comes in slabs, some very thin yet sturdy, which can be applied to walls and floors. And with digital technology, manufacturers are able to replicate some of the most desirable marbles (Carrara or Calacatta) or granites.  The look of exotic-colored stones also is available with remarkable authenticity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Currently, matte black is a hot trend in faucets and hardware. Burnished and polished gold are also trending, and pairing them with black is especially chic. Mixing metals, like satin metal and polished nickel with gold also is more acceptable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One guideline for choosing materials that are basically semi-permanent: Being on-trend (modernizing the classics) is fine, but being trendy (here now, gone tomorrow) is not.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Be sure to allow enough time</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As soon as you have a plan, try to get through the selection process for materials as quickly as you can. Ask about inventory even before you place your order, so you’re not disappointed. You may be unpleasantly surprised to find that your favorite tile or stone, or that dreamy vanity you&#8217;ve got your eye on, will take an extra 6 to 8 weeks to show up. However, i</span><span class="s1">f you can’t imagine living without it, go for it! It may be well worth the wait.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Demolition and prep</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On average, ripping out old bathroom material is a day’s work. It depends on how large the room is, and how extensive the renovation will be. For instance, removing a tile floor or wall may take a bit longer. Tweaking plumbing and electrical, which may require rerouting or new wiring, also is part of the process.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Installation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ve passed through the rough and dirty parts, and now you’re in the fun phase. When surfaces, fixtures, and lighting get installed (allow 1 to 3 days), take a moment to enjoy it! Grab some pictures on your phone to show your family and friends. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Detailed scopes of work</h3>
<p>&#8220;I was very fortunate to have <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/aleks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aleks and his team</a> work on my apartment&#8217;s renovation. From the start when I met him for the first time, Aleks was friendly, very meticulous, and attentive to details. He proposed options and recommendations for my requirements without being aggressive. Aleks provided me with a very detailed scope of work. Because of this, it only took the property management company of my co-op building 2 weeks to approve the work. They did a full renovation of bathroom and kitchen, refinishing the floors, painting, replacing the closet shelvings and bars, and refinishing the closet doors.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Handling difficult building management</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eli and his team</a> on a kitchen renovation in our co-op. For anyone that has worked or owned a co-op before, you know there can be a lot of back and forth with approvals with the co-op board and management company. Eli was a great partner in getting all of the necessary documentation to the management company, and communicating directly with them when needed.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Working with the budget</h3>
<p>&#8220;We had a wonderful time working with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4137#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James</a>. As first-time homeowners, we had heard horror stories from friends about unresponsive contractors they had encountered while renovating. Certainly not our experience at all with James. They worked around our budget and helped us understand which items were worth splurging on and where we could cut back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Kris was very respectful of our budget and was great about letting us know if any changes we made were going to increase the estimate and by how much.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:[null,2,16043212],&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kris</a> was very respectful of our budget and was great about letting us know if any changes we made were going to increase the estimate and by how much. We had heard so many horror stories from our friends that made us nervous at first—but Kris and his team though were very professional and completed the work on time and on budget. We&#8217;re thrilled with the work they did!&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Leading first-time renovators to success</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/santiago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Santiago</a> was very pleasant and easy to work with. As first-time renovators, we appreciated his patience in answering our 1,000,000 questions. He was very flexible in helping us define a scope for the project that matched our budget and helped us strategize to make our money go the furthest. During the work phase, his team was mindful of the fact that we still lived in the space (with a toddler!) and did their best to minimize disruption to our lives. They also finished on time and on budget!&#8221;</p>
<h3>Consistent, clear communication</h3>
<p>&#8220;Working with <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/meet-sweeten-general-contractor-paul-new-york-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pellumb (Paul)</a> was hands-down the best renovation decision I made. He has incredible communication skills and kept me informed from start to finish. As an interior designer in the industry for over 12 years, I was pleasantly surprised to meet a contractor with such pride and commitment to his work. His crew was timely and respectful when working in my home. I was lucky enough to go on vacation for 2 weeks towards the end of the project, and when 2 surprise leaks were discovered, the problem was resolved without hesitation. Paul was only a WhatApp message away with pictures and updates of the problem being solved.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Friendly subcontractor teams</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;During the construction, we got to know all the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor&#8217;s workers</a> and really enjoyed having them around. (And even know all their personalities and preferred playlists!) They are respectful and diligent. Most importantly, they&#8217;re very experienced and are able to give good suggestions and to make decisions. We lived on-site for the second half of the project. It was definitely messy and frustrating at times, but the crew made it easier for us. We truly appreciated that.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Helping hands for materials &amp; design</h3>
<p class="p1">“From the beginning, <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/paulina-albert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paulina</a> &#8216;got&#8217; what we were looking for: a modern, minimalist aesthetic that is functional for a family. Her creative design of the space, kitchen, closets, and built-ins helped to maximize our space and make our apartment feel much more spacious than the actual square footage would suggest. Our 9-year-old daughter gave her a nearly impossible task to find &#8216;teal and rainbow&#8217; tiles for her bathroom and she found a beautiful iridescent tile that has drawn the admiration of all who have seen it.”</p>
<h3>Keeping a clean worksite</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;During the work, I was able to stay in my apartment because <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/meet-sweeten-general-contractors-nina-ilya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ilya and Nina</a> took great precautions to cover everything with plastic so that it wouldn’t be covered with dust. At the end of each workday, the team also cleaned up the workspace, to the extent possible, and stored everything in one, compact space.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/meet-sweeten-general-contractor-paul-new-york-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul</a> and team have been amazing the whole way, and while we did more than half of the work before we moved in, we moved in while the top floor was still being renovated and lived in the space for about 8 weeks during construction. The team was great in keeping the site clean, but we really noticed that they kept the dust and construction contained once we had moved in too!&#8221;</p>
<h3>Problem-solving pros</h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Chris is an incredibly responsive general contractor and a great problem solver. He was always quick to respond to emails, texts, and phone calls regardless of time of day. My project was a gut renovation in an apartment that hadn't been occupied for over 6 years. Despite some challenges, including a bathroom so small that a standard sized tub couldn't fit in, a leak discovered by Chris's plumber, and a switch from a gas stove to electric, Chris was able to deliver the project on time and close to the initial proposal. The few change orders were my chosen enhancements to the project - including a custom closet and moving the bathroom pipes closer to the edges of the wall to gain a few inches for the bathroom. Highly recommend Chris. Gut renovations in a New York City apartment co-op are incredibly stressful and Chris was a reliable contractor I trusted to get the job done and appease the board.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16773836},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">&#8220;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5698#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris</a> is an incredibly responsive general contractor and a great problem solver. He was always quick to respond to emails, texts, and phone calls regardless of the time of day. My project was a gut renovation in an apartment that hadn&#8217;t been occupied for over 6 years.

<h3>Tackling big projects with ease</h3>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4112#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neil</a> is great to work with. Our project was massive! New roof, gutters, windows, and siding, to our 95-year-old free-standing house. Plus, we completely gutted and redesigned the basement with upgrades in plumbing and electrical, as well as finding and fixing a leak issue that caused the basement to flood during heavy rains. Doing such a variety of work required tremendous organization, workweeks planned weeks in advance and staying flexible when the unexpected arose. Neil handled each step with patience and humor, and so when each project was finished, we felt happy, confident, and satisfied that the craftsmanship was what we desired and all problems were resolved.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your house needs a few improvements and you have the urge to do them all immediately. Every project seems to announce itself with equal priority. Unless you’re awash in money and time, you cannot address all at once. You need to sift through your priorities—starting with knowing where to splurge vs. save during a renovation. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Below, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> helps you understand where to splurge vs. save so you can define your priorities.</span></p>
<h3>What does splurging mean?</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Splurging doesn’t mean overspending. It can mean shifting money from one project to another. Or placing one project higher on the to-do list than other projects. Splurge on things that you touch or see often. Splurge on things that are meaningful to you or which make you happy. </span></p>
<h3>What does saving mean?</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Saving doesn’t mean to skip or ignore. It means that you can safely put it on the back burner for now. Or if you want to do it, you can dial down on the cost a bit. Many times, after the project has been on the back burner long enough, you might see it in a clearer light.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Once you think in terms of splurge vs. save during a renovation, all of these home projects fall into an order that makes perfect sense.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: Kitchens</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">Splurge: Kitchen Countertops</span></strong></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Every day, you touch, see, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use your kitchen countertops</a>. Whether you choose quartz, solid surface, natural stone, laminate, or wood, your countertop choice is semi-permanent. After the design, fabrication, and installation, changing out your countertop shouldn&#8217;t be taken lightly. If you want a certain type of quartz countertop, but choose a shade or pattern that you don’t feel strongly about, ask yourself: How will I feel about this in a year? </span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Kitchen Appliances</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchen appliances are better designed than ever. The rising tide of improved kitchen technology lifts all boats—even for lower-priced appliances. With research, you can find lower-cost refrigerators, dishwashers, cooktops, and ranges that fit your needs. These appliances often match or exceed the quality of higher-priced versions from only a few years ago. </span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: </span><span class="s1">Bathrooms</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Bathroom Fixtures</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bathroom fixtures are more than just mechanical devices. They aren&#8217;t just knobs and levers that start and stop the water. Fixtures are ornaments that complement a beautiful shower, tub, or sink. Spend more to splurge vs. save for bathroom fixtures that make you happy.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Bathroom Technology</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Technology has entered all parts of our lives, so why not the bathroom, too? IoT, or the Internet of Things, is a concept that describes how common things within our life are now Internet-equipped. Bathroom technology and IoT are not gimmicks! IoT devices can track water usage, regulate heating, and allow the bathroom to better adapt to your needs. Bathroom technology has its place, and it is the future. But for now, you can limit your bathroom smart devices or put them on the back burner.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: </span><span class="s1">Living rooms</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Paint</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That designer paint that you’ve been eyeing? Now it can be yours. You can easily justify spending more on the premium paint that you want in the living room. That’s because the living room gets so much facetime, and it’s so public. Poor quality paint may flake, chip, or fade over time, costing more in the end. When you decide to splurge instead of save on your desired paint, you’ll be happier in the long run.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Lighting</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Living room lighting, while necessary, does not need to be expensive. Prioritize the shape and the finish of the lighting fixture over the brand name. One trick of designers is to over-scale lighting fixtures for a dramatic look. Just make sure that all of the in-wall wiring for sconces and ceiling lights is complete first!</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: </span><span class="s1">Bedrooms</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Bedroom Closet systems</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An unfinished closet is an empty box waiting for your stuff. However, that stuff has no place to go unless you create a system. Gone are the days of the closet rod with one shelf above it. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Closet storage systems</a> belong in all closets now. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Reach-in closets benefit from a shoe fence or shoe cubby, two or three drawers, and plenty of open shelving, plus a closet rod. Walk-in closets should be outfitted with the same and more: additional shelves and drawers, pull-out baskets, multiple hanging areas, and lighting.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Millwork and trim</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Custom millwork and trim are the finishing touches for homes. If yours is a home of architectural significance, custom trim throughout is practically required. But if you want to save money, you can ease back on the fancy millwork in the private areas of the home. Save the ceiling medallions, crown molding, chair rails, dentils, batten, and picture rails for the dining and living areas.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: </span><span class="s1">Basements</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Basement Flooring</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Moisture is usually the deciding factor when you consider <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whether or not to finish your basement</a>. Prevalent moisture can turn an expensive basement remodel into an uninhabitable area best used for storage. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An attractive, moisture-shedding floor covering and a subfloor system can make a world of difference. Begin with the subfloor system, interlocking 24-inch squares that elevate your floor covering about 1-inch. Then, choose a basement-ready floor covering that you love, whether ceramic or porcelain tile, luxury vinyl planks, engineered wood flooring, or laminate flooring.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Guest bedrooms</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Building out a guest bedroom in your basement is a wise move when you know that it will get frequent use, either by friends and family or as a rental unit. But if you want a guest bedroom in your basement only for the occasional visitor, you’re taking up valuable space best used for other activities.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: Attics</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Built-in storage</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Built-in storage doesn’t often rank high in priority in other parts of the house, but this is not the case for attics. Attics are starved for space to begin with. Once you add furniture, you have even less storage room. Knee walls are the short walls that extend from the floor to the rafters. Knee walls that have built-in storage should be built during the remodeling process, not later.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Full bathrooms</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Full bathrooms—toilet, sink, and shower or shower/tub—are a rarity in attics unless the intent is to build out an entire suite with living quarters. Otherwise, attics used as offices or children’s play areas work well with just a half-bathroom.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs Save: Decks</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Deck Flooring</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your choice of deck flooring can easily make or break how much you end up using—and loving or avoiding—your deck. With that in mind, you’ll want to prioritize decking.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For the best in looks and maximum strength, choose a premium wood such as ipe or mahogany. Both are long-lasting, easy to maintain, and they return maximum resale value. Composite wood—a mixture of wood fibers and plastics—is smooth, splinter-free underfoot, and looks remarkably like wood.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Deck Built-ins</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Built-ins such as benches, tables, and planters are wonderful additions to decks. Built-in benches are especially valuable because they tuck away to the side, opening up more space in the center of the deck. Yet one way to pare down your deck-building budget is to save the built-ins for a later day. The same builder (or a different one) can always come back and create those built-ins that your heart desires.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Splurge vs. Save in a Renovation: Conclusion</strong></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Almost every room in a home would gladly use a piece of the budget. Knowing what projects can wait until a later date, or what may or may not maximize the full breadth of the room, can help guide on where to splurge vs. save in your renovation.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45354 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog.jpg" alt="A brand new condo remodeling Miami" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">City of Miami building permits </span></h3>
<p><span class="s1">Are you considering condo remodeling in Miami? While renovating a condo is usually a more limited proposition than renovating a house, Sweeten offers guidelines on a few special considerations you’ll need to take into account.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">First,</span><span class="s1"> you will need to obtain the proper city and building approvals before beginning your project. Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6622#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miami contractor Sandra</a>, who is based in Miami, tells us, “The typical process takes about 4-8 weeks for a mid-sized project. [Usually,] the office management has pretty much the same requirements as the city.” You must apply first to the city, and once the city approves the permit, the information is submitted to the management office for the condo. The most common permits required in a condo remodeling Miami project are </span><span class="s1">floor soundproofing, plumbing, electrical, and framing.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Building requirements </span></h3>
<p>In addition to obtaining city permits, many new building projects must also meet new building requirements. You must usually meet and comply with regulations around work hours, rubbish removal, gas installation, and more. Licensed <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/miami-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Miami</a> with experience would be able to navigate any building paperwork and restrictions.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of everything you should be mindful of during your project:</p>
<h4 class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">1) Working hours</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">These are more limited than in a free-standing house. Typically, buildings will permit workers access between the hours of 9AM &#8211; 4PM (occasionally, until 5pm) on weekdays. This translates into shorter working hours. As a result, a condo renovation may take longer than that same project in a house.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">2) Prepping common areas</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Buildings will require workers to protect the common lobby, hallways, and elevators. This needs to be done on a daily basis. Just note, this can keep the GC from working on the actual project on any given day. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">3) Rubbish removal</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">As in all large buildings, trash removal presents a bigger obstacle than in a free-standing house. As Miami-based Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6382#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miami contractor Adrian</a> explains, due to the more protracted process, “the cost of removing the trash is much higher in a condo than in a single-family home.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">The cost for a trash removal service is based on the number of “pulls” it takes to remove debris. According to Adrian’s experience, to remove and replace floor tile in a 1,000-square-foot condo, he estimates it would require four pulls (2-3 for old tile, and one pull for new tile waste). The cost would be around $3,000.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor Sandra concurs: “We spend a lot of time doing this and do it on a daily basis. That means we need to reserve the elevator every time we have to bring it down. We cannot use the building dumpster, so we need to put it in our truck and haul it away.” </span></p>
<h4 class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">4) Altering the slab</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Since even the oldest Miami condos date only back to the ‘50s and ‘60s, they are largely concrete structures. Sweeten contractor Sandra explains, “It is possible but very complex. We would need a structural engineer affidavit and structural plans.” Management will likely be strict about this aspect of the renovation. After all, altering the slab can affect the building&#8217;s other units. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Technically, it is possible to trench or drill to lay plumbing or electrical. However, you would need to prove that you will not compromise the integrity of the slab. Oftentimes, buildings will require “scanning” (via a professional vendor) of the area where the proposed alteration will occur. Sweeten contractor Adrian estimates that it usually costs approximately $600 to scan 100-200 square feet. </span>“If you are going to core drill, the building may not require an engineer to sign off on the alteration,” said Adrian. “But if you are going to trench along the slab then they most certainly will.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h4 class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s3">5) Gas</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4">Most Miami condos feature electric stoves and dryers. That said, gas stoves are becoming slightly more common in new luxury buildings. Our Sweeten contractors do not know of buildings that permit gas dryers. If your condo unit does not currently have a washer/dryer in-unit, there’s a 50/50 chance that it’ll be permitted. Again, this is up to your management company’s rules. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s3">6) Windows</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4"> Due to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-to-prepare-your-house-for-hurricanes-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the seasonal hurricanes</a>, building codes require impact windows. Luckily, this isn’t the responsibility of the individual renovator because windows are typically a building-wide project. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s3">7) Fees</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4">Lastly, expect the management company to charge you a fee for renovating your condo. Just note, these fees are paid in addition to any permit and approval charges. These fees aren&#8217;t unique to Miami, this is standard in condos across the U.S.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, you should have a sense of what to look out for in your Miami condo renovation. </span><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <span class="s2">renovate with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best general contractors in Miami</a></span>.</span></p>

<h3>How to pay your general contractor during a renovation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/pay-safely-for-home-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Secure Pay</a></span><span class="s2"> lets you pay your home renovation deposit digitally, right from your Sweeten dashboard. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Until now, many contractors only accepted cash or paper checks, with all the associated inconveniences and delays—and complete lack of protections. Hiring and materials purchases would often be delayed until the check cleared.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Sweeten Secure pay links to your bank account or credit card. It lets your contractor know immediately when funds are on the way, and completes the transfer in 1–2 business days.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s2">Benefits of Secure Pay:</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s2">Pay for home renovations safely, with confidence. Transfers are handled by our trusted banking partners, Dwolla and Stripe—leaders in the financial industry. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Pay by credit card or bank transfer (ACH) </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Pay easily, right from your Sweeten dashboard </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Payments clear in 1–2 business days; your contractor sees instantly that funds are on the way. You can quickly make your hire official, and secure your place on the contractor’s calendar. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Your banking information stays private. Sweeten and your contractor can’t see or store any financial information. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></span></h3>
<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637075677893"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Why is Sweeten Secure Pay better than writing a check?</strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You get the convenience of paying for home renovations digitally and responding directly to your contractor’s deposit request. You&#8217;ll avoid delays, and can secure your place on the contractor’s schedule as quickly as possible. Receive a permanent record of your transaction alongside your other renovation information. And if you pay by credit card, you get all your card company’s perks.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637075732129"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Do all Sweeten general contractors accept deposits through Sweeten Secure Pay?</strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Sweeten Secure Pay is new; general contractors will have to set up their accounts before they can receive funds. Ask your contractor if they’re ready to receive Secure Pay deposits.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637075768647"><strong class="schema-faq-question">How do I sign up?</strong></p>

If you have questions about the deposit request, you’ll have as much time as you need to discuss with your contractor. No funds will transfer until you explicitly approve the payment.</p>
</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How to remodel your garage into living space, a rental studio, or even a gym</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45280" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nashville-Garage-Blog.jpg" alt="garage remodel nashville" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nashville-Garage-Blog.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nashville-Garage-Blog-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you are like many homeowners, you may be looking in all directions to increase living space. Looking upward means building a second story. Looking toward the back translates to a house addition. But one direction that is often overlooked is to the side or front: the garage. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines how a garage remodel in Nashville could be your solution amid several home addition options. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Types of garage remodels</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Living rooms or family rooms</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Garages are often remodeled to provide supplemental living or family room space. The garage is insulated, wired, painted, and flooring is installed. Sometimes, a small powder room, with only a toilet and sink, is added. The powder room eliminates trips to the main part of the house.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Living quarters for renters</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some homeowners choose to install a self-contained apartment for renters. This arrangement can give the homeowner a source of passive income. Over the long term, it may defray the cost of the garage remodel. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Living quarters typically include a bedroom, full bathroom, and a kitchen. A lockable pass-through to the main part of the home is usually included. With this, homeowners can lock the door on their side to prevent the renters from entering. Most remodels of this nature include a separate exterior door so that renters can enter their apartment without going through the main house.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Living quarters for self or family</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Garages are often remodeled to provide living quarters for elderly parents, friends, or children. In many cases, this apartment has the same facilities as does an apartment for renters. </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Dedicated entertainment or work area</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your garage remodel may create a single room or multiple rooms for a specific purpose. The remodeled garage may become an entertainment room, home movie theater, gym, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/derelict-garage-finds-purpose-she-shed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office, workshop, or studio</a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Garage remodel costs in Nashville</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Garage remodel permits alone can cost $1,000 to $1,500. For a simple living-room space that does not include plumbing, the cost will begin in the $10,000 to $20,000 range. Most of this cost is devoted to outfitting the space with a floor and filling in the garage door.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">More often, though, garage remodels intended as living quarters begin at $20,000 and rise sharply.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Garage remodel process and timeline</span></h3>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Before you speak to a contractor, decide on the primary function for the remodel. A basic family or living room can be a relatively simple project since plumbing may not be involved. A full-scale rental apartment will be more expensive and will take several weeks or months.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">After you’ve <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">received multiple estimates</a> and chosen your contractor, discuss if any Nashville overlay and zoning issues need to be considered.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">You will meet with the contractor and an architect. The architect will draw up plans. The contractor applies for permits.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">After a roll-off dumpster is delivered to the property, workers demolish parts of the interior of the garage. The garage door is removed.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Carpenters fill in the empty space where the garage door was located. Usually, this will be an exterior wall system, complete with insulation and perhaps even windows.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Depending on the plan, workers may need to frame the floor with joists. This will raise the floor to the height of the main house’s floor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">With the walls open, electricians and plumbers run wire and pipes through the walls.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Carpenters frame the interior walls and the ceiling.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Workers add a heating and cooling system.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Drywall installers hang and finish the drywall.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Floor installers add the floor covering of your choice on top of the subfloor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">A painting team will paint the inside of the garage remodel. They will also paint areas outside of the garage, in front.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Plumbers finish installing bathroom fixtures. Electricians complete the rest of the wiring.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">How a garage remodel affects house value</span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">One important consideration before starting a garage remodel is whether it will increase the value of your home.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you are considering a garage remodel in Nashville, you might be thinking of immediate, personal needs. Your family may be increasing in size. Or you may have elderly parents who need housing. In either case, remodeling your garage may represent a lower net financial cost than building a separate structure or buying a new house.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">On the other hand, if you do intend to eventually sell your home, consider how the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">garage remodel will affect your home’s value</a>. Potential home buyers may view the lack of vehicle storage as a deficit. Other buyers may welcome the extra space.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Permits and restrictions</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The City of Nashville requires a building permit for any new building or a modification of an existing structure. You must also have permits for individual tradework, such as for electrical, plumbing, or HVAC work. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nashville is a city of many historic structures. The Nashville Metropolitan Historic Zoning Commission (MHZC) was formed to protect Nashville’s architectural styles and character. If your home is located in a historic preservation and historic landmark overlay, you must apply for a Preservation Permit.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">MHZC permit applications require a full set of plans, elevations, photos, and more. After you submit the permit application, the MHZC will meet to consider your project. After a permit is approved, you must stick to the conditions of the permit. For example, the MHZC will impose penalties or injunctions if the garage siding does not match that of the rest of the house.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Nashville and Davidson County, neighborhood leaders and government officials take a close look at Airbnb-type rentals. These types of rentals are called Short Term Rental Properties (STRPs). The Metro Codes Department must approve of your rental property before you list it as an STRP (but not before you build it).</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Heat and cool your garage remodel in Nashville</span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">With Nashville’s extremes of heat and cold, you should add a heating or cooling system to your garage remodel. Generally, there are three options:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li6"><span class="s3">Continue with the main house’s HVAC system. Workers continue the ductwork from the main house into the garage. The main house’s HVAC system must be adequate to handle the increased loads. This option works well when remodeling a garage for a living or family room: one that will flow seamlessly from the main house.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s3">Install a separate HVAC system. This is the best option when remodeling a garage as living quarters. It is also the costliest option.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s3">The lowest cost installation option is heating in the form of baseboard or wall heaters. For cooling, install one or more window or wall unit air conditioners. Installation is less expensive but the cost of service is higher. This is because baseboard heaters, wall heaters, and window unit A/Cs are less efficient than HVAC systems.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Where to park your vehicles</span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When reviewing permit applications for garage remodels in Nashville, the city will want to know where the displaced vehicles will go. Like most large cities, Nashville wants to reduce the number of cars that are street-parked.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you have a paved driveway, the solution can be as simple as moving the cars to the driveway instead of in the garage. This is the lowest cost solution, though your vehicles will be left out in the open.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you have ample room in the front of your property, you may wish to build a carport or even a new garage. This will completely or partially protect the vehicles. It also may appeal to future buyers. Zoning issues may come into play since a 20-foot setback in front must be maintained. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">A garage remodel is a lower-cost alternative to building an addition but it is not low-cost. Think of a garage remodel as an investment in your home’s value and in your happiness.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Developing a budget is your first step to your dream home. Sweeten contractors will want to sit down with you and inspect your home to reach an accurate number. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a quick overview of budgets for some typical renovation projects:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Gut renovation: starting at<span> </span><strong>$80 – $100</strong><span> </span>per square foot (psf)<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Low-end kitchen remodel: starting at<span> </span><strong>$10,000 – $15,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-range kitchen remodel: starting at<span> </span><strong>$25,000 – $30,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen remodel: starting at<span> </span><strong>$40,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Low-end bathroom remodel: starting at<span> </span><strong>$8,000 – $15,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-range bathroom remodel: starting at<span> </span><strong>$15,000 – $25,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end bathroom remodel and expansion: starting at<span> </span><strong>$30,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Deck composite:<span> </span><strong>$19,000</strong><span> </span>or<span> </span><strong>$60</strong><span> </span>psf<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Wood deck:<span> </span><strong>$13,000</strong><span> </span>or<span> </span><strong>$40</strong><span> </span>psf<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">2020 Dallas remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2020, a total gut renovation in Dallas that brings your home down to its bare bones and remodels it to your liking, starts at<span> </span><strong>$80 – $100</strong><span> </span>psf for a home that has low-range finishes. This means materials such as laminate flooring and countertops, value-brand appliances, and basic tiles from big box stores like Home Depot. Both<span> </span>Sweeten contractor Joel<span> </span>and<span> </span>Sweeten contractor Kyle, both based in Dallas, </span><span class="s1">have worked on renovations that came under this budget range. These scenarios, however, are dependant on the scope of work and existing conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although a gut renovation is a big project, consider doing it all at once to get you the best bang for your buck. You’ll also have your dream home much quicker than renovating room by room. </span></p>
<p><span>As a guide, Joel advises clients to tie the price of your kitchen (or bathroom) renovation to the price of your home. You should only spend between 10 and 20 percent of the value “to really cap the budget at the return on investment,” Joel said. So for a <strong>$300,000</strong> home, aim to spend between <strong>$30,000</strong> and <strong>$60,000</strong> on a bathroom or kitchen remodel, which will be a major slice of a gut renovation project. </span></p>
<p><span>Before getting started, Kyle suggests homeowners should research other recent remodels in the area to see what materials and appliances were used. This is important if you want to resell quickly so you don’t end up with a low-end renovation in a high-end area or vice versus. If this is your forever home, then your personal taste is more important than whoever you might sell to years later.  </span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a Dallas kitchen remodel costs per square foot in 2020</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s5">A Dallas kitchen renovation i<span>n the best-value range can start at <strong>$10,000</strong> and reach <strong>$15,000</strong>. A kitchen renovation in the best-value range can start at <strong>$15,000</strong>, according to Kyle. To get a new kitchen at this price, it needs to be a rip-and-replace job, meaning a layout of the kitchen must stay the same with pipes and appliances remaining where they are. Cabinets are the highest ticket item in a kitchen budget, said Joel. To keep costs down cabinets can be re-stained or re-painted. The next step up is pre-fab followed by semi-custom. Fully custom costs the most, he said.</span><br /></span><span class="s5"><br /></span></li>
<li class="li5"><span><span class="s5">A mid-range kitchen remodel in Dallas has costs starting at <strong>$25,000 – $30,000</strong>. What does a mid-range kitchen look like at this starting cost? T<span class="s1">he kitchen layout must remain the same as a rip-and-replace: swap your old oven for your new one and your old sink for your new sink. </span></span><span class="s1">You can get a stainless steel sink with single-lever faucet, laminate countertops, a built-in microwave, new appliances, custom lighting, and semi-custom cabinets. An island could also be added. Moving plumbing, gas, and electrical, reconfiguring the layout, or choosing custom features will increase the budget.</span></span></li>
<li class="li5"><span>For an upscale kitchen, labor costs and a refresh with select high-end materials such as marble or quartz countertops, imported backsplash tile, and high-quality fixtures start at <strong>$40,000</strong>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The upscale kitchens Kyle has worked on were budgeted from <strong>$50,000</strong> and up. A big chunk of those budgets were for custom-made cabinets, as well as quartz countertops and expensive backsplashes. “Adding French doors or moving walls to create a larger kitchen…” also brings up the price, Kyle said. As will above and below cabinet lighting, moving plumbing, and custom-built islands, he said.</span></p>
<p><span>There are plenty of variables in most materials, Joel said. For example, with quartz, you can spend <strong>$2,000</strong> or <strong>$7,000</strong> depending upon the quality. “It just comes down to not overbuilding for your house,” Sweeten contractor Joel advised.</span></p>
<h5><span class="s10_overlay-text"></span></h5>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a Dallas bathroom remodel costs per square foot in 2020</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">At the low-end, expect a rip-and-replace bathroom with no behind-the-wall surprises to start at<span> </span><strong>$8,000 – $15,000</strong>.</span> These are typically smaller master baths or guest bathrooms. The layout will remain the same where plumbing doesn’t move, Kyle said. This budget won’t include any issues like leaks or mold discovered once the project begins. Materials will include a prefabricated vanity, ceramic tile, and fixtures from big-box stores.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">In the Dallas area, a mid-range bathroom can start at<span> </span><strong>$15,000 – $25,000</strong>. The average cost for this price range remodel is about<span> </span><strong>$20,000</strong><span> </span>or<span> </span><strong>$570</strong><span> </span>psf, as per<span> </span><em>Remodeling</em>‘s Cost Vs Value<span> </span><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/west-south-central/dallas-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>. The key to a budget in this range is rip-and-replace. This means keeping the layout the same and swapping out an old toilet for a new one, an old vanity for a new one, etc. That way, no expensive plumbing work is needed.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The example project for this budget is a 35-square-foot bathroom. You can install a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. More<span> </span></span>than<span> </span><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/west-south-central/dallas-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">55 percent of your budget</a><span> </span><span class="s1"><span>can be recouped in the value the project adds to your home.  </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">
<p class="p1"><span><span class="s1">For a high-end bathroom remodel and expansion, the cost can start at <strong>$30,000</strong>. </span><span class="s2">This budget includes a three-piece bathroom (tub/shower combo, toilet, and sink) for a typical 5’ x 7’ space. The cost increases with features including a double vanity, creating a separate shower from the tub, specialty tile, a custom vanity, or a toilet with additional functions.</span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Cost drivers are things like removing an existing tub or shower to install a new standalone tub,” said Sweeten contractor Kyle. It can also include building larger showers, moving walls to expand bathroom size, custom vanities, and frameless glass shower enclosure.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">2020 costs for outdoors &amp; deck remodeling in Dallas </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dallas is a city perfect for outdoor entertaining, whether it’s a crisp winter night in front of the fire pit or a cold beer paired with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/how-to-prepare-your-home-for-extreme-heat-in-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hot summer evening</a>. An outdoor area is often the cherry on top of a dream home remodel. It’s the project to really let your creative juices flow. There are endless options to make your outdoor area your own with extensive outdoor kitchens, gas fireplaces, fans and misting systems for cooling, custom lighting, and landscaping. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A basic wooden deck will likely cost<span> </span><strong>$40</strong><span> </span>psf or<span> </span><strong>$13,000</strong><span> </span>for something in the 320 square foot range, according to the Cost Vs Value<span> </span><span class="s6">report</span>. A deck made from composite, a mix of wood product and plastic, will cost just under<span> </span><strong>$19,000</strong><span> </span>for the same size or<span> </span><strong>$60</strong><span> </span>psf. This material tends to last longer and requires less maintenance. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">2020 Remodeling costs in Dallas: Permits</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dallas is experiencing a lot of new building construction. This has resulted in a more rigorous approval process compared to approvals for existing homes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are numerous cities and towns that make up Dallas. Each one has its own building department and its own fee structure for permits. Your Sweeten contractor will likely put an estimate in the budget for building permits, which will be determined by your end costs or square footage of your project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The upmarket suburb of Highland Park bases building permit costs on square footage. The permit for a 200 square foot kitchen renovation costs<span> </span><strong>$490</strong>, according to Highland Park’s calculator.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the city of Addison,<a href="https://addisontexas.net/sites/default/files/fileattachments/development_services/page/10881/fee_schedule_for_bldg_permits.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s6"><span> </span>building permit fees</span></a><span> </span>start at<span> </span><strong>$40</strong><span> </span>for projects under<span> </span><strong>$500</strong><span> </span>in value. Fees then increase with the project’s budget. For example, a project with a budget between<span> </span><strong>$2,000</strong><span> </span>and<span> </span><strong>$25,000</strong><span> </span>will have a base cost of<span> </span><strong>$115</strong><span> </span>with an additional<span> </span><strong>$23</strong><span> </span>per<span> </span><strong>$1,000</strong><span> </span>for estimated costs over<span> </span><strong>$2,000</strong>. That means the permit for a<span> </span><strong>$20,000</strong><span> </span>mid-range bathroom remodel will cost<span> </span><strong>$529</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building permit fees in<span> </span><span class="s6">Cedar Hill</span>, southwest of the city’s center, are determined by square footage. There is a set fee of<span> </span><strong>$400</strong><span> </span>for any renovation of less than 1,250 square feet. For each additional square foot over 1,250, the permit increases by<span> </span><strong>$.60</strong>. After 2,500 square feet, it increases by<span> </span><strong>$.40</strong>.</span></p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">If you’re planning a gut renovation (taking a home down to the studs and building it back up,) and are using budget-level finishes, expect to pay $80-100 psf in Dallas, Texas. A good rule of thumb for Dallas homeowners is to limit spending on a renovation project to 10-20% of your total home value. This helps control the budget while ensuring you’ll get maximum resale value for the renovation itself.</p>

Higher-end kitchen remodels in Dallas will cost $50,000 and up; for layout changes, custom work, and premium materials.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When the Brownstone Boys<span>— </span>Barry Bordelon and Jordan Slocum<span>— </span>began renovating their 130-year-old brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, they decided to document the journey. Their multi-story home seemingly squeezed in bedrooms wherever they could (five!), a kitchen sat in the middle of a living room, and the kitchen needed an upgrade. Ready for the deep-dive, the pair had original woodwork restored, overhauled the cooking space and modernized the home throughout. The room they&#8217;re most proud of? A bedroom-turned-guest-bath. &#8220;</span><span class="s1">We went classic New York all the way—subway tiles, hex floret floor tile, and claw foot tub,&#8221; the duo said. &#8220;We added a reclaimed door adding chicken-wire glass and stenciled &#8216;WC&#8217; into it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Brownstone Boys shared some do’s and don’ts with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a </span><span class="s1">free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects</span><span class="s1">.

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Brownstone Boys: The &#8220;Do&#8217;s&#8221; of renovating:</span></h3>
<h4><span class="s4">1. Make sure you have the right team</span><span class="s1"> (contractor, architect, specialists)</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/VrQ4mS7dRo8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44984 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-PlasterMolding.jpg" alt="Brownstone Boys renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-PlasterMolding.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-PlasterMolding-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span class="s1">It’s one of the first things you’ll do. You’ll be spending a lot of time with these professionals. Make sure they understand the project, have the skills needed, have a good track record, and are easy to communicate with.</span></p>
<h4><span class="s4">2. Get together a solid budget and leave room for contingency</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/90TDAm-UtHE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44985 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-PocketDoors.jpg" alt="Brownstone Boys renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-PocketDoors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-PocketDoors-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span class="s1">Surprises can be waiting when you open up the walls. Decisions you make in the design phase can also impact the budget. Making large structural changes can require the need for a structural engineer. HVAC plans may call for a mechanical engineer. Be prepared to set your priorities and create a budget that leaves room for the inevitable surprises. Depending on the size of your renovation, leave about a 10-20% contingency.</span></p>
<h4><span class="s4">3. Get 3-5 estimates from contractors</span></h4>
<p><span class="s1">You’ll learn something with every walkthrough you have with a contractor. Quotes can vary greatly. Some contractors have crews of their own rather than subs for certain things which can lower costs. Some have more experience in areas that might especially help in your project. You could easily see some quotes come in double from others. Getting 3-5 estimates will help you understand the full range and put you in the best position to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">choose the bid that works for your project</a> the most. (Hint: that is often not the cheapest one).<br />
</span></p>
<h4><span class="s4">4. Plan on a lot of things taking longer than you expect</span><span class="s1"> </span></h4>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/hF68zFmWLyA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-44983 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-KitchenAfter.jpg" alt="Brownstone Boys renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-KitchenAfter.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-KitchenAfter-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-KitchenAfter-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Photo: Dave Sauerhoff</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">City approvals, landmarks approvals, plumbing inspections, finishes selection, and material delivery are all part of the process. Things along the way will also create delays. If you build in extra time, it will be much less stressful.</span></p>
<h4><span class="s7">5. Organize your inspiration photos so you have a good sense of what you want</span><b> </b></h4>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/B9fujQEGX5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-44982 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-GuestBath.jpg" alt="Brownstone Boys renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-GuestBath.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-GuestBath-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-GuestBath-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Photo: Dave Sauerhoff</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">For many people, going through a renovation will require making more decisions in a short period of time! It will take time and you’ll want to think about details and materials carefully. Start organizing your thoughts early so that you know what you want later.</span></p>
<h4><span class="s7">6. Have<b> at least weekly meetings with your contractor</b></span><span class="s1"><b> but remember they need their space to work </b></span></h4>
<p><span class="s1">Hopefully, you selected a contractor who is easy to communicate with and responsible enough to be given some autonomy. You likely won’t be on-site daily, but it’s a good idea to set a weekly walkthrough to review what has been done the previous week, what issues have come up, and what will be done over the following week. At the same time, it’s probably not the best idea to micromanage your contractor on a daily basis. You want them to work efficiently and you should be able to trust them to get the job done. If you don’t, then you might not have the right team.<br />
</span></p>
<h4><span class="s4">7. Order finishes with proper lead times and the right quantities</span></h4>
<p><span class="s1">Some finishes have longer lead times than others. If you don’t have enough of that custom tile to finish your bathroom, you might have a 6-8 week wait for more (whoops!)<br />
</span></p>
<h3>Brownstone Boys: <span class="s1">The &#8220;Don&#8217;ts&#8221; of renovating</span></h3>
<h4><span class="s4">1. Don’t live in a construction zone.</span><span class="s1"> We know it’s tempting.</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PBOqdbPvZtM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-44991 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-ParlorAfter.jpg" alt="Brownstone Boys renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-ParlorAfter.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-ParlorAfter-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-ParlorAfter-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Photo: Bridget Badore</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The budget is tight and a month-long camping trip in your own house might sound fun, but the process can be stressful. It can easily spill over into the unmanageable. Don’t have a hard deadline to finish. Whether it&#8217;s a lease expiring, a previous home sold, a due date, have a backup plan should the project go over. It will be less stressful for you and your family and your contractor can focus on completing the renovation. </span><span class="s1">It will likely be worth the expense to have some lease overlap or temporary living arrangements so that you have some breathing room.</span></p>
<h4><span class="s4">2. Don’t change your mind<span>—</span>and your plans<span>—</span>throughout the process</span><span class="s1"> </span></h4>

<p><span class="s1">It’s one of the biggest causes of delays. Changing finishes, configuration, and plans mid-renovation will slow things down to a crawl. Make decisions early so that you have time to let them sink in so that any changes are made well before that phase starts.<b></b></span></p>
<h4><span class="s4">3. Don’t put off work that can easily be done while walls are open and unpainted</span><span class="s1"><b> </b></span></h4>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/TjbuyyLT2CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44981 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-FrontDoor.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-FrontDoor.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-FrontDoor-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span class="s1">Your budget might require you to push some items to the future, but make sure they are projects that make sense to do once the main renovation is complete. For example, don&#8217;t add an AC system or move walls. You will destroy a lot of recently finished walls and floors. While your walls are open, do the projects that require any electrical or plumbing changes. </span><span class="s1">Before the floors are finished, this is the time to move walls. Adding new windows or putting in that steel deck are items that could be put off for later. They likely won’t require you to undo what’s already been done. <b></b></span></p>
