										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Now you can have America’s-next-top-chef pro-style quality at home</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone" title="a chef's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Cara_Kitchen-Bathroom-11-723x487.jpg" alt="White galley kitchen with commercial style kitchen appliances" width="723" height="487" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><em> (Above)</em> Cara and Jared <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/before-after-cara-and-jareds-chelsea-kitchen-and-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/">kitchen renovation</a></span></p>
<p>When commercial appliances first appeared on the home kitchen scene some 20 years ago, they were the couture of cooking: beautiful, very expensive, and available only to a select few who could manage the price tag and installation. With the renaissance of home entertaining and the widespread popularity of cooking shows, manufacturers have answered the homeowners’ call for a commercial style that can easily fit into a new or renovated kitchen. Looks still lead the way, with shimmering stainless steel and sturdy controls. Function has kept up, too, thanks to improvements in cooking, cooling, and cleaning, to justify that price tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a><span> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Commercial Kitchen Ranges </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s much easier these days to purchase a commercial-style kitchen range for a home. You&#8217;ll find ranges that provide the function you seek, at a size and scale that fits into a home kitchen. Serious at-home chefs covet range features like cast-iron grates, stainless-steel surfaces, and quick-to-heat burners controlled by sizeable knobs. The controls with the <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DCS collection from Fisher &amp; Paykel</a> are illuminated, a safety feature that adds an extra touch of glamour.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another benefit of commercial-style kitchen ranges: they offer flexibility, which home cooks need. One such example is dual fuel, or ranges that feature a gas cooktop plus an electric oven. This provides the immediacy and control of a gas cooktop, with cooking power of up to 25,000 BTUs, and the precise performance of a true convection oven. Modern ranges also have digital panels that help you program correct temperature and cooking times to assure perfect results.</p>
<p>Before purchasing a commercial-style range, there are a few drawbacks you should consider. Some commercial-style kitchen range models have smaller oven cavities than their non-pro-style counterparts, so check the size to make it can handle your Thanksgiving turkey. The self-cleaning feature may also need to be sacrificed if that’s not important to you. Luckily, you’ll make it up in adjustable grates, cooktop grills, and superior simmering capabilities with flames that go as low as 140 degrees. Some brands have unique features. Thermador’s burners, in the shape of the company’s star emblem, disperse the flame heat to more evenly heat the entire surface of a pot. Fisher &amp; Paykel’s racking system allows the rack to extend as much as 75 percent outside the oven cavity, handy when removing a heavy dish, like a roast or a Dutch oven.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial Kitchen Refrigerators</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first commercial kitchen refrigerators to capture the imagination came with glass doors. It&#8217;s ideal for a professional kitchen, as many chefs working together simultaneously need to see what’s inside quickly and easily. For the home cook, <a href="https://true-residential.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">True Refrigeration</a> offers a stainless-framed glass door option reminiscent of that commercial version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another key feature of a commercial kitchen fridge is stainless steel. As an external material, it lends a pro-style touch. Also, some manufacturers, like True, offer stainless steel as an interior finish, too. Newer fridge models have black stainless steel for an extra touch of drama. Considering color? <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlueStar</a> claims to have more than 750 colors and finish combos to match its cooking products.</p>
<h4>Features inside the fridge</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What’s going on behind cool-looking doors is just as important to the home chef, who may shop once a week and needs all that food to stay fresh. Look for features like individual climate-controlled drawers, adjustable racking systems, and extra-large shelves to hold entertainment platters and pizzas. <a href="https://www.thermador.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thermador</a> has introduced removable bins on the fridge door that can be loaded with ingredients for meals during the week, then removed to the kitchen counter when it’s time to prep dinner.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial-style Dishwasher</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Real commercial dishwashers, perhaps surprisingly, lack all the features that homeowners have come to depend on. They basically serve to wash and sanitize, so you won’t find them with adjustable racking systems or garbage disposals. In fact, with a true pro version, you would have to thoroughly rinse the glasses and dishes before placing them in the washer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re set on a commercial-style, dishwasher, start with stainless steel. This sparkling metal says the appliance means business, just like its cooking and cooling counterparts described above. Hefty, architectural handles complete the pro-style effect (unless you prefer a look with controls hidden on the inside panel.) Inside, look for adaptable features like adjustable or removable racks and baskets. As for function, there’s plenty from popular manufacturers to make you happy, including a range of wash cycles, a timer, super-quiet operation, and a childproof lock. Want all the bells and whistles? Spring for a third rack from manufacturers like Bosch, or a built-in water softener from <a href="https://www.jennair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenn-Air</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial-Style Kitchen Faucets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The introduction of the pull-out <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-trends-kitchen-faucets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faucet</a> two decades ago forever changed our impression of this indispensable kitchen tool. Finally, with minimum effort (and splashing), you could spray the entire sink—as well as the inside of a pasta pot. Commercial-style kitchen faucets take this advantage a step further. Many offer single-handle operation, a higher-than-average arc, and a spray that can swivel 360 degrees. Look to plumbing experts like <a href="https://www.isenbergfaucets.com/kitchen/">Isenberg</a>, <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/kitchen-faucets/article/CNT125900008.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler</a>, and <a href="https://www.grohe.us/kitchen/kitchen-faucets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grohe</a> for more handy options. There are even options for foot control, for completely hands-free operation, like the pros enjoy. If you love sparkling water, Grohe also makes a pro-style faucet that puts fizz in your tap water when you want it.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peek inside a commercial kitchen and you’re likely to see stainless steel on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counter surfaces</a>. The sanitary, odor- and moisture-impervious benefits are obvious. However, dings and scratches become pretty obvious. If the patina of usage isn’t for you, check out natural or engineered stone. Professional chefs love it for the same reasons homeowners do: it can take heat without scorching, yet stays cool to the touch. Natural stones such as granite and marble will, nevertheless, show stains, so if you don’t want to risk marring the perfect surface, consider an engineered stone like <a href="https://www.dekton.com/usa/what-is-dekton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dekton</a> or <a href="https://www.caesarstoneus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caesarstone</a>, which claim to resist all liquids, including wine and juice.</p>
<h4>Creating a commercial-style kitchen at home</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning a kitchen renovation involves loads of decisions as you work your way through all the choices for appliances and materials. Commercial style kitchens, while at the higher end of the budget spectrum, remains a classic, and a trend with staying power, if you take the time to find those products that sync with your individual cooking style.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Whether granite slabs or a full-on marble bathroom, natural stone offers durability, resistance to bacteria, and the flexibility to match every style</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20725 size-chrono" title="natural stone" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-723x496.jpg" alt="natural stone" width="723" height="496" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-723x496.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-300x206.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-600x412.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Laura and Peter&#8217;s bathroom features <a href="https://Sink, shower, wall and floor tiles in marble shower" target="_blank">floor-to-ceiling marble</a>, including radiant heat flooring</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">When it comes to the bathroom, nothing says luxury like real stone. Covering a wide price range, it makes it an easy go-to when designing the bath space. </span><span class="s1">Greater accessibility to quarries, wider distribution, and competition from dealers have all made this possible. An impervious (or nearly) surface also makes it suitable for almost every surface from walls, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank">floors</a>, countertops, and tub surrounds. Not all natural stone is alike, however. Some are more durable than others but with thoughtful attention to use and placement, you can enjoy this classic material in the bath. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choosing real stone</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Typically, the most common reason to choose one stone over another is to achieve a specific aesthetic,” says <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank">Sweeten contractor Phil</a>. “There are just some specific nuances that people look for that can only be found in a specific stone.”</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b></b>The most popular choice for stone in the bath is marble, thanks to its timeless appearance. Before you make your decision, consider other natural elements each with their own distinctive qualities. </span><span class="s1">Granite, travertine, and slate are all hard stones that hold up well to water in the bath, and each offers a particular look. Shop around as every slab is unique.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Think about where you would like to see it used. Will it be used to cover vertical and horizontal surfaces, or as an accent? If you’re working with a strict budget, you can enjoy a small application of stone, as a border around porcelain tile or behind the sink, or as a slab for the countertop. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Marble</span></span><span class="s2"> <b><br />
</b></span><span class="s1">A classic and versatile option, marble works in both traditional and contemporary settings. Distinguished by rich veins, it comes in many shades of white, as well as subtle grays, pale gold, and black. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Among the most popular are the white marbles: Calacatta and Carrara. The veins on Calacatta tend to be bolder than those on Carrara. Calacatta Gold, as its name indicates, includes gold-colored flecks. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Crema Marfil offers a creamier tone, almost like ivory. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Bardiglio is a deep gray stone with a blend of paler gray and black veins. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Nero Marquino is a black marble with white veins. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">All of these marbles take a polished or matte finish. On a floor, use a matte surface or a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/blueprint-comes-life-family-duplex/" target="_blank">mosaic</a>. The smaller pieces, with lots of grout lines, help prevent slipping.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Marble is one of the more porous materials. </span><span class="s1">If you use it in the bath, be prepared to seal it. Ask the fabricator to recommend a sealant product. “Homeowners can seal stone themselves, and there are many easy-to-use solutions on the market,” says Phil. Seal the stone first when it’s installed, and twice a year or so. “The frequency can vary due to use and location,” he says. </span><span class="s1">If you use it in the bath, be prepared to seal it several times a year, and you may have to tackle mildew if you place it in your shower pan, where water is likely to hit it daily.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Granite</span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b>For many years, granite was a favorite countertop for kitchens. <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s harder than most stones and nonporous so it can take moisture in the bath.</span> The pattern tends to be more granular than marble making it easier to coordinate with other designs. It comes in many more colors—whites, grays, and browns, as well as blues, greens, and reds. Install it as a slab as a countertop, or if you want to go all the way, apply slabs to the walls and tiles on the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Travertine</span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b>Like marble, travertine conjures luxury. Think ancient monuments and historic buildings (Sacré Coeur in Paris). The surface pattern combines subtle veins and fine granular patterns for a rustic look. Honed or tumbled finishes soften the effect. Colors range from cream or ivory to earthier golds and browns.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Slate</span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b>A fine-grained stone, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-gets-a-nordic-look-for-bathrooms-and-closets/" target="_blank">slate</a> comes in variations of blues, greens, browns, and grays for an elegant yet rustic look. When finished, it’s not as smooth as marble or granite. This makes it more naturally slip-resistant but still needs to be sealed.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Check for variations<br />
</b></span><span class="s1"><b><b><br />
</b></b></span>Stone is mined from a quarry, not manufactured, so each piece is unique. Color can vary by a lot, so if purchasing stone tile, ask to see the identification on all the boxes and be sure they go together. Buy an extra box in the case of repairs so the replacement tiles match.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Choose the finish</b></span></p>
<p>Marble and granite can take many different finishes—polished, honed, tumbled. There are a couple of new finish treatments called “leather” and “flamed” that polish the surface to a matte effect while playing up some of the grain.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Caring for your floors</b></span></p>
<p>Every natural stone requires sealing before it is installed and then periodically afterward. Frequency depends on the stone type and the amount of traffic received. If your bath sees activity every day, particularly from shoes, put down an area rug to catch grit and scuffs. Make sure the rug is rubber-backed so it doesn’t slip.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Consider the pros and cons</b></span></p>
<p>If you want natural, unique surfaces in the bath, stone makes a great choice.</p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• It resists water, bacteria, odor, and fire. Wet areas, like the shower, will require </span><span class="s1">a waterproof membrane underneath. Factor in regular maintenance, such as sealing. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• As hard as stone is, it’s also at risk from scratching, so lift furniture instead of sliding it, and sweep regularly to remove grit.  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• Cracking can occur without proper installation, so make sure your contractor prepares an even subfloor. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• <span style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing a damaged area can be difficult and costly. This is particularly true if the area is large. Play it safe with tiles or mosaic on the floor, where damage, if any, is more likely to occur from a dropped item. The smaller-sized tile and mosaics make it easier to replace a piece or two.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• Naturally cool, the material is a bonus in summer, but not so nice in winter on bare feet. Since natural stone transmits heat well, installing radiant heating before the tile is set may be a nice perk.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Faux stone and alternatives</b></span></p>
<p>With the recent refinements in high-definition printing, the look of stone is convincingly reproduced in porcelain tile. Porcelain is fired with a glaze making it impervious to water and less likely to scratch. This means it doesn’t have to be sealed regularly. At 3/8-inch thick, it’s also thinner and lighter than stone. The lighter weight makes it cheaper to ship, bringing down the cost.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Check out quartz, like Dekton and Caesarstone. This man-made material incorporates finely ground stone in a high-pressure manufacturing process to produce a surfacing material that is as hard as the real thing and claims to be impervious to stains </span><span class="s1">from liquids like wine and cooking oils. This super-hard quality requires less maintenance than real stone and contributes to the recent growth in popularity of quartz. Because it is a man-made material, you have more control over the appearance. </span><span class="s1">Manufacturers offer faux stone looks as well as the whitest whites, blackest blacks, and colors, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Stone in the bath is an investment of time and money. Your payback is a unique yet timeless look that, with a little attention to regular maintenance, will afford you with a room that you can enjoy for your lifetime.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Prepping to pick kitchen countertop materials? Let these 9 Sweeten-remodeled kitchens inspire you</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just because kitchen counters get a lot of use in the home doesn&#8217;t mean they can&#8217;t also look beautiful! But where should you start when picking kitchen countertop materials? Well, there are a few things you should know about each type of countertop material before making your final selection. Here&#8217;s a rundown of our favorite kitchen countertops from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> renovation projects: gorgeous photos <em>and </em>material descriptions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27214 size-chrono" title="countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-723x482.jpg" alt="countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-13618"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Quartz Countertops</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quartz is a type of engineered stone, made from a combination of minerals, pigment, and resin. It is available in a wide range of colors and texture complexity. Quartz has become the most popular kitchen countertop material in <a href="https://sweeten.com/kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten kitchen renovations</a> probably because it is slightly less expensive, per square foot, than some of its other natural stone cousins, and because it is prized for extreme durability, resistance to stains and scratches, and its non-porous surface, which helps retain polish without sealants or waxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Ketrina’s Sweetened Clinton Hill Kitchen – Homeowner Guest Post" href="https://sweeten.com/clintonhillcoops/ketrinas-sweetened-clinton-hill-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13005 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-03.jpg" alt="Ketrina Quartz Kitchen Countertop" width="600" height="901" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-03-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“The stone is my favorite thing about the new space – it’s like having a piece of fine art right in my kitchen.” </strong></em><em><strong>– Ketrina, Clinton Hill homeowner</strong></em></p>
<p><a title="Ketrina’s Sweetened Clinton Hill Kitchen – Homeowner Guest Post" href="https://sweeten.com/clintonhillcoops/ketrinas-sweetened-clinton-hill-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ketrina in Clinton Hill</a> chose a quartzite countertop in cream-colored Madreperola (Mother of Pearl).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Claire &amp; Mike’s Park Slope Kitchen Renovation — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/claire-mikes-park-slope-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-12205 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SWEETEN_ClaireKitchen-08-600.jpg" alt="Claire Quartz Kitchen Countertop" width="600" height="883" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SWEETEN_ClaireKitchen-08-600.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SWEETEN_ClaireKitchen-08-600-204x300.jpg 204w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Claire &amp; Mike’s Park Slope Kitchen Renovation — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/claire-mikes-park-slope-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claire and Mike in Park Slope</a> chose a quartzite countertop in Dolomite “super white”.</p>
<p><a title="Heather’s Sweetened Upper West Side Kitchen Renovation – Homeowner Guest Post" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/heathers-sweetened-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-12971 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SWEETEN_HeatherUWSKitchen-08.jpg" alt="Heather Quartz Kitchen Countertop" width="600" height="898" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SWEETEN_HeatherUWSKitchen-08.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SWEETEN_HeatherUWSKitchen-08-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>“I love having guests over and can invite them to sit at the counter while I’m prepping snacks or a meal.” </strong></em><em><strong>– Heather, Sweeten homeowner </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Heather’s Sweetened Upper West Side Kitchen Renovation – Homeowner Guest Post" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/heathers-sweetened-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather</a> went with <a href="https://www.lgviaterausa.com/productOverviews/33/by-product-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG’s Viatera</a> quartz countertop in Cirrus for her Upper West Side kitchen.</p>
<h3><strong>Granite Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Granite is a natural stone with wide variation in color and detail. Its resistance to heat and scratches makes it a classic in the kitchen. Granite is known for its durability, but can require periodic re-sealing.</p>
<p><a title="Before &amp; After: Robyn and Alejandro’s Columbia Waterfront Industrial Kitchen — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/before-after-robyn-and-alejandros-columbia-waterfront-industrial-kitchen-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13524 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unnamed-2.jpg" alt="Robyn and Alejandro's Columbia Waterfront Kitchen -- Sweetened!" width="600" height="410" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unnamed-2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unnamed-2-300x205.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Before &amp; After: Robyn and Alejandro’s Columbia Waterfront Industrial Kitchen — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/before-after-robyn-and-alejandros-columbia-waterfront-industrial-kitchen-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robyn and Alejandro</a> in Brooklyn’s Columbia Waterfront District chose a granite countertop with gray undertones and luminous purple specks.</p>
<h3><strong>Marble Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marble has become an increasingly popular choice in luxury kitchens. More porous and softer than granite and engineered stone, (marble counters need to be sealed and are more susceptible to stains and etching), design-focused renovators seem to be willing to put up with marble&#8217;s drawbacks for its uncontested good looks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Five Design Tricks Transform an Uptown Kitchen" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/five-design-tricks-transform-uptown-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12607 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_UES-04.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_UES-04" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_UES-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_UES-04-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Lauren and Adam</a> included a Calacatta Caldia marble countertop with faint traces of green, gray, and yellow veining from <a href="https://www.abcworldwidestone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC Stone</a> in an Upper East Side kitchen.</p>
<h3><strong>Soapstone Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Highly heat-, stain-, and bacteria-resistant, soapstone is a non-porous natural stone that is available in a range of light to dark gray matte tones, all with subtle veining. Unlike granite and marble materials that require sealing, soapstone needs regular polishing with mineral oil to help conceal surface scratches and add patina.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Corey’s Williamsburg Kitchen Renovation — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13113 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-06" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-06-599x900.jpg 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Corey’s Williamsburg Kitchen Renovation — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corey in Williamburg</a> chose a soapstone countertop from a local supplier’s stone yard, and extended it all the way down into the sink.</p>
<h3><strong>Dekton Countertops</strong></h3>
<p>A tougher and more durable alternative to concrete countertops, Dekton is an ultra-compacted hybrid of raw materials common to quartz, porcelain, and glass. The result is a virtually impenetrable surface with a grittier, industrial feel.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12659" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_DanKitchen-02" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Dan and Mike’s Manhattan Kitchen Renovation — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan and Mike</a> in Hell’s Kitchen chose a <a href="https://www.dekton.com/usa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dekton</a> waterfall counter in Chrome.</p>
<h3><strong>Butcher block countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ideal for adding warmth and charm, butcher block wood countertops provide a hardworking surface for food preparation. A number of Sweetened kitchens have mixed wood countertop sections with other materials like natural or engineered stone. This mix provides different options for food prep and serving. While butcher block is naturally heat-resistant and affordable, it can stain and age, wear in high-use areas and requires regular sanding and oiling to protect the wood.</p>
<p><a title="Five Design Tricks Transform an Uptown Kitchen" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/five-design-tricks-transform-uptown-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12604 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_UES-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_UES-05" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_UES-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_UES-05-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Lauren and Adam</a> included a maple butcher block prep nook with a knife storage block in an Upper East Side kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12526" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-10.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill Co-op Renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-10.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-10-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A <a title="Scandi in Brooklyn: Sweetened Clinton Hill Co-op Renovation" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/scandi-brooklyn-sweetened-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton Hill couple</a> chose a butcher block counter to compliment the white on white palette with wood accents in their kitchen.</p>
