<p>In the 21st century, an increased awareness around wellness has led renovators and contractors alike to seek ways to turn homes into healing spaces. More knowledge about lighting, paint, non-toxic materials, soundproofing, and heated flooring have helped transform homes into soothing sanctuaries. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, asked some of its contractors and architects the best approaches to bringing a philosophy of wellness and healing into their home renovations.</p>
<h3>Bring in the light</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most affordable way to make your home a healing space is with lighting. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Sean</a> recommended installing dimmer switches on every light fixture. You might have a headache from a day at the office with bright lights, but dimmers allow you to adjust the lighting to your liking in every space. “Coming home should be a sanctuary,” said Sean, who met his business partner at a meditation retreat. Their business is founded on renovating homes for mindfulness, healing, and safety. With dimmers, Sean said it’s important to remember installing the switches will require a master electrician and possibly approval for meeting state codes. After these requirements are squared away, though, you could be coming home to a comfortable ambiance in short order.</p>
<p>When it comes to lighting during the day, windows are key. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5093" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Julia</a> tries to incorporate natural, sustainable materials into homes as much as possible, which includes glass, native plants, and light. You want windows that invite as much natural light into your home as possible. If your windows are on the small side and you’re unable to expand them, there are some creative fixes. Julia has used white epoxy paint and mirrors as reflective surfaces to amplify natural light. Contractor Sean also said he maximizes natural light with mirrors.</p>
<h3>Install radiant heat flooring</h3>
<p>Even the most motivated person might have difficulty leaping out of bed once winter arrives, especially when your feet hit a cold floor. Radiant floor heating is just one way <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Scott</a> said clients feel like they have spent wisely. This cost-efficient way to heat your home provides warmth via electric wires or hot-water tubes hidden beneath the floor. This means no radiators clanking, random heat pockets, or vents with heat surges. An even blanket of heat rises from under your feet, meaning you can turn down the thermostat and reduce heating bills.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37088 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (Above) Sweeten homeowner Christina <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/alcove-studio-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproofed her floors</a></span></p>
<h3>Soundproof walls and floors</h3>
<p>Many New York codes now require <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproofing</a> between floors, and the softening of footfalls can result in other healing side effects—the extra cushion could extend both the life of your floors and your ankles.</p>
<p>Scott said insulation inside walls or on the surface of walls, foam, for instance, can also create a peaceful setting by diffusing outside noise. He added that soundproof windows can help silence everything from garbage trucks to fire sirens. As with all renovations, soundproofing comes with an increased cost based on square footage and labor. The low end of soundproofing walls might increase renovation costs by 5 to 10 percent while the high end could double costs. As for soundproofing floors, Sean gave a range of 10 to 30 percent of an increased expense over a typical floor renovation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Scott&#8217;s clients have been amazed at how healing it can be to keep unnecessary sounds out of their home.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40679 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08.jpg" alt="" width="997" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08.jpg 997w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px" /><span class="img-label"> (Above) Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/mid-century-mad-men-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bathroom renovation</a> with images of nature</span></p>
<h3>Consider the color palette</h2>
<p>The walls could be the next spot to consider for transforming your home. Sean recommended soft, earth tone hues with paints that are low-VOC—or lower in the volatile organic compounds they contain. In some cases, he also employs wallpaper with images of nature. “We can put a garden of birch or cypress in a foyer that can be breathtaking,” Sean said.</p>
<p>Julia has studied Japanese design strategies and recommends minimalism to create an environment that prevents feeling overwhelmed. She likes a focus of one to three colors and offers a reminder that white can be a wise choice to maintain simplicity and enhance mindfulness.</p>
<h3>Think about insulation alternatives</h3>
<p>Feeling safe is essential to being comfortable in your home. Humidity and dampness, especially in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">basements</a>, can create toxic molds. One of the key ways to prevent toxic mold is proper insulation, including in-wall solutions such as MemBrane. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Elizabeth</a> is on the cutting edge of using natural, non-VOC (volatile organic compounds) and non-toxic materials throughout homes. Elizabeth said it might cost a little more for renovators to ensure their home is both environmentally-friendly and safe for their health, but it might not cost as much as they think. “It doesn’t cost twice as much, but it costs a little more,” she said. “I compare it to buying organic foods.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth lists several insulation materials that aren’t harmful: cellulose, rock-wool, denim, mineral wool board, and GUTEX. Rock-wool and denim insulation, she said, are especially easy and low-cost and might lend themselves to DIY. Elizabeth has completely stopped using spray-foam insulation.</p>
<h3>Create efficient cook spaces</h3>
<p>Sweeten general contractor Sean said he ranks the places where we both make our food and eat it as high priorities for creating a healing environment. “We pay special attention to making the kitchen/dining areas, where we nourish and nurture ourselves, into a welcoming space with easy-to-clean, well-lit work surfaces,” he said. “We also encourage the client to choose efficient appliances that keep foods fresh and make quick work of healthy meals and we locate them in the space for the most comfortable, ergonomic layout.”</p>
<h3>Designate a Zen room</h3>
<p>Some people want to create a specific room to serve as a designated sanctuary. In this case, many of the elements highlighted so far can apply to a room for yoga, meditation, or any other restorative activity.</p>
<p>For example, some contractors incorporate elements they’ve used in creating commercial yoga or Pilates studios into the home. When creating a Pilates studio, Julia used natural light to its full effect. After discovering a skylight in the back of the room, she used reflective epoxy white paint on the floors to magnify the abundance of natural light streaming in through the front windows.</p>
<p>Other touches might be used as well. At a yoga studio for children, Scott turned a space behind the building into a grass turf so children could practice yoga comfortably outside.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, Scott said, he wouldn’t have given much thought to the possibility of a peaceful space for yoga or meditation anywhere. &#8220;Now, the option is on his mind constantly. “If a client is comfortable, they feel like they got bang for the buck.”</p>
<p>A healing space can create the right environment that helps well-being carving a new path to your dream home. Said Sean, “If we don’t take this time for self-care, we’re no good to anybody.”</p>
<p>—</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Gut renovate a bathroom in a 117-year-old house in Connecticut</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: In 2016, Joel and Nina, along with daughter Bailey, and their cats, Cookie and Coco, bought a stunning Victorian home in Cos Cob, Fairfield County, Connecticut. They had been living in the area for some time and wanted a quieter street and a house with more space. The 2,700-square-foot home, complete with a two-and-a-half-car garage and stained glass windows in the foyer, won them over pretty quickly. However, their first winter in the home made them realize something was seriously problematic with the bathroom that they couldn’t see. “The room was an icebox, so we knew something was wrong,” said Joel. “We just didn’t know the extent.” Besides the temperature issues, the bathroom had a &#8217;70s vibe and needed updating. It was also small—seven by eight feet—and the couple saw a better way to utilize that space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/21690" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel and Nina were novices</a> with this type of project, so they turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that pairs homeowners with fully vetted general contractors, to find <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a> and help them navigate the process. The unknown source of the cold turned out to be a huge hole in the outer wall, not to mention almost non-existent installation. “The whole room, more or less, had to be rebuilt,” said Joel. New spray foam and fiberglass insulation were installed as needed. To better organize the space, the family had an 18-inch-deep vanity custom made, which was shallower than the previous one. They also moved the entry door slightly for better access. The project took four months instead of the original five-week <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timeline</a>, mostly due to the room being in worse shape than had been expected. Also, custom shelving that Joel ordered took a long time to arrive. One piece of advice the couple has is to avoid delays by having all the materials on the job site ready to go. “We didn’t, which is one of the reasons the project took so long,” he explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The original linen closet had the issue of being too deep, rendering its far corners almost unusable. Joel and Nina’s Sweeten contractor installed moveable shelves that slide in and out of the closet so they could maximize every inch of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Soundproofing walls and windows add a layer of acoustic luxury</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20390 size-full" title="soundproofing" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Soundproofing floors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>(Above) Deniz and Ramon&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/deniz-ramons-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproofed apartment</a> in Brooklyn</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Chances are, if you live in New York City, you’re used to the hustle and bustle of busy streets and vertical living. You’ve learned to sleep through that early morning garbage pick-up, and don’t even notice your upstairs neighbors’ scampering dog anymore. But “acoustic comfort”—as the experts say—is a very personal thing, and certain situations call for some measure of soundproofing to improve your space (for example, you live next to a 10-year construction project or there are six dogs upstairs instead of just one). </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">We consulted Stan Gatland II, an expert on the subject of acoustics and sound comfort at <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CertainTeed</a>, for the basic considerations on how to tackle noise issues and what solutions might work best for your circumstances.</span></p>
<h3>What are the sources of the noise pollution?</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">When it comes to noise pollution, Stan tells us that you can attempt to address the <b>source</b> of the noise—by asking the building’s board to talk to your neighbor, e.g.; you can have the <b>receiver</b> alter his or her behavior—from wearing earplugs to ultimately deciding to move to a different apartment. But given that these two options are not always feasible or desirable, you can aim to minimize noise by obstructing its <b>path</b>, which is how we arrive at soundproofing. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">An important note: Noise takes the path of least resistance, and can be transmitted in two ways. Determining how the sounds are transmitted is crucial to deciding which fixes to apply.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Airborne noise</b> can be either high- or low-frequency, such as your opera singer neighbor or the tuba player on your street corner.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Structure-borne or impact noise</b>, is usually low-frequency. Examples include vibrations from your building’s mechanical systems, a pet or child running in the apartment above, or a chair scraping the floor.</span></p>
<h3>How to reduce noise</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Once you’ve discovered the culprit—and it may be a combination of both airborne and impact noise—you can decide the types of solutions to employ. Airborne sound is usually dampened by adding layers of dense but flexible materials to the surface in question. Impact or structure-borne noise is a more complex matter requiring a professional to &#8220;break&#8221; or minimize the connections between transmission points, usually by adding gaps in the home’s structure (explained below). Some of the major ways to cut the clamor:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Make sure your home is airtight</b></span></span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The level of airtightness will do wonders for your noise problems. On windows, consider double- or triple-pane, as well as weather stripping and caulking, to fill any spaces that sound may travel through. For doors, solid core is best (check out <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">this Sweeten post</span></a> to learn more), and acoustic seals can be applied to the threshold and around the perimeter of the door to fill the gaps. Don’t forget about the small and often overlooked problem areas—such as doorbells, light sockets, and outlets—which are all sound paths. Recessed lighting is a particular offender. Make sure everything is enclosed, capped, and sealed. A tiny gap can amplify the noise exponentially.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>“Float” your walls, ceilings, and floors</b></span></span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Disconnecting the drywall layer from the framing is the best way to address impact noise and reduce airborne sound transmission, and can be done by suspending walls, ceiling, and floors via various methods, says Stan. One way is to add “resilient channels,” essentially metal channels that separate the drywall from the studs so that there are fewer points of connectivity. Another way is by using specially engineered drywall, such as <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SilentFX® QuickCut</a> noise-reducing drywall, a CertainTeed product that uses a viscoelastic polymer between two specially formulated dense gypsum cores that produces the same effect as resilient channels. Floating floors and ceilings use a similar technology to minimize the connections.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Add more insulation and absorptive materials</b></span></span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">&#8220;Light, porous materials are best for absorbing noise, and these can be applied on the surface of the drywall as well as within,&#8221; explains Stan. Often, clay or metal gets mixed into vinyl to create more heft in these acoustic barriers. Additional drywall layers can be helpful too, as can widening the spacing between studs, or using metal rather than wooden ones. In terms of insulation, fibrous materials are best, since they offer the best aspect of trapped air. New constructions will typically have concrete slabs between the floors, which is a great sound dampener. </span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">But fear not—even if you don’t have concrete slabs, there are less involved ways of adding layers to absorb sound. You can add acoustical ceiling tile or wall panel systems to the surfaces in the room. Layering soft materials, such as a tapestry on the walls, thick carpets and drapes, upholstered furniture, and even lush plants will help to reduce noise echo. Placing a shelving unit full of books next to the wall you share with a loud neighbor will also be effective in reducing sound transmission through the adjoining surface. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Can soundproofing be eco-friendly? </span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The measures you take to address sound minimization may also help with energy efficiency and climate control. For example, airtightness and added insulation will guide you toward achieving both goals. As for the materials themselves, most insulation is now low- or no-VOC, and many no longer include formaldehyde. You could go even greener by using <span class="s2"><a href="https://hemptechglobal.com/page15/styled-29/page116.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hemp</a> or</span> <span class="s2"><a href="https://www.goodshepherdwool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wool</a> in place of typical fiberglass insulation. </span> Shredded blue jeans is also a recyclable material used as insulation. These options are typically more expensive for the same effect, however.  </span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>How much does it cost to sound proof?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Now that you’ve had a crash course in soundproofing, it’s time to get started! If you have a simple problem, such as hallway noise coming through your front door, you can resolve it for a few hundred dollars by purchasing an <a href="https://acousticalsolutions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">acoustic door seal kit</span></a> and asking your super to install it. Unfortunately, more extensive problems require specialized expertise, and it may be worth your while to commission a sound analysis or diagnosis report from an acoustics expert. Every situation is different and a pro can help you determine the source and paths of your sound issues, plus suggest appropriate solutions. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">You’ll need to decide how deep a retrofit you are willing to undergo, what kind of budget you have, and how much you&#8217;re willing to be inconvenienced; all are variables that will factor into the solutions an expert suggests. Extensive retrofitting, which will require you to move out of your home, will range from $50 to $80 dollars per square foot for walls, while ceilings and floors will run you $70 to $110 per square foot. Soundproofing can be a complicated process, but to some, silence is golden.</span></p>
