<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Make a kitchen better suited for entertaining and cooking<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Rob, a musician, purchased an apartment on the top floor of a Harlem brownstone six years ago. Shoko, a writer, moved into the Harlem abode two years ago, and the couple has lived together ever since. Their 900-square-foot apartment dates back to the late 19th century, though the interiors were updated in the early 2000s. Overall, they were happy with how the home looked (except the kitchen). “The kitchen&#8217;s orange-y cabinetry, shiny black appliances, and brown countertop stuck out. Rob travels a lot for work, and every time we&#8217;d FaceTime, he&#8217;d see the cabinets in the background and say, ‘Okay, that&#8217;s it. Let&#8217;s really do it this time.’ Finally, we just decided to take the leap,” Shoko shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Shoko-Wanger-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39660 size-full" title="oak-cabinets-and-black-appliances-before-renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Shoko-Wanger-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" alt="oak kitchen cabinets with black appliances and hardwood floors before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Shoko-Wanger-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Shoko-Wanger-Kitchen-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Shoko-Wanger-Kitchen-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: The couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/33823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to Sweeten and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a>. Aside from the overall appearance changes, the couple also wanted to improve the flow and function—more storage was a must. “We decided to redo the kitchen mainly because as we get older, we find ourselves spending more and more time at home. We love to eat out, but we also love to cook and have friends over,” Shoko shared.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They worked with their general contractor and a web-based design company specializing in IKEA kitchens, <a href="https://inspiredkitchendesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inspired Kitchen Design</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to bring their vision of a minimal, but warm space to their kitchen. The cabinet bases the couple chose were outfitted with custom cabinet doors from Semihandmade (a recommendation from designer </span><a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keren Richter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whose work Shoko has written about and that&#8217;s been <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/food-writer-uses-hotel-inspired-style-art-deco-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">featured on Sweeten Stories</a>). “I loved their aesthetic, and as soon as I saw their Supermatte clay slab, I was sold on that color-wise,” she said. The open shelving and brass drawer pulls are also from Semihandmade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the kitchen didn’t take advantage of the ceiling height. The renovators decided to extend the upper cabinetry as close to it as possible. The extra space has now left them wondering if they should get more appliances, like a stand mixer. “That&#8217;s something I never dreamed I&#8217;d say as a New Yorker in a (relatively) small space,” Shoko shared. Their other design decisions, from the lighting to the countertops, were all part of creating a cohesive, simple look. Together, their finishes and materials feel warm, inviting, and clean.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple worked very closely with their general contractor to bring <span style="color: #333333;">IKD’s</span> design to fruition. “The contractor’s role was incredibly important from the outset—and it grew in importance as the project progressed,” Shoko said. He focused on understanding the full intention of the design, providing recommendations and workarounds (when needed) at every stage. “Not only did he and his team install the entire project, but they were a much-needed set of extra eyes with an experienced concern for aesthetics and functionality. We feel so lucky to have found them, and couldn&#8217;t recommend them highly enough,” she continued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, getting started on the project proved to be the biggest challenge. The renovation process itself only revealed a few minor issues: the walls weren&#8217;t straight and required hidden adjustments to make the measurements work out; and some delivering delays. Regardless, they stayed on time—and budget.</span></p>

Their general contractor provided assurance (and answers) the whole way through.</p>
<p>“We are so happy with our kitchen. It&#8217;s exactly what we wanted. It makes our entire apartment feel brighter and bigger, and it&#8217;s a total pleasure to cook, eat, and host there. We feel even more at home than we did before,” Shoko said.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Shoko’s favorite element of the new kitchen? It’s a tie between then open shelving and countertops. “ I love ceramics, so it&#8217;s fun to have a space to display our favorite things. We were also very excited about our new countertop. That bright white <span style="color: #333333;">Caesarstone</span> is a breath of fresh air,” she said.</p>

<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: This feature, originally published in the summer of 2015, is one of Sweeten&#8217;s favorite dramatic makeovers. An overpowering closet flanking the existing galley kitchen seemed to squeeze the entry even tighter. The changes, though, were striking: the walls came down, and newly-placed high gloss cabinets took the spotlight, amplified in natural light. The affordability of this <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/kitchen-cabinets-fronts-24254/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full IKEA kitchen</a> renovation is an extra bonus. The takeaway: a bit of shiny goes a long way.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lee Hoffman bought a 1+ bedroom, 1 bathroom co-op in Midtown East. The original kitchen and bathroom were beyond forlorn; the kitchen was hidden behind a walled entryway and was more of a hallway than a room. This might have been initially helpful during its heyday in 1978, but not ideal in an apartment that depended on the kitchen window for extra light in the living room. Lee did months and months of research on ways to update the space. He came to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a contractor who could change up a cramped kitchen and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update a plain bathroom</a>.</p>

<p>After reviewing a selection of Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Manhattan</a>, he chose one to re-envision the space with some nice cabinets and tile. However, the renovation turned into much more than that.</p>
<h3>Tackling a cramped kitchen layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lee found himself up against one major, invisible force when he <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started the kitchen project</a>: the co-op&#8217;s previous tenant had been a smoker and the original stock finishes were covered in smoky residue. The layout for the already-small kitchen didn&#8217;t work well. The space was virtually sealed off from the living room, and its big window was partially blocked by cabinetry and a fridge that had been wedged into the galley. Lee knew he could swap in new cabinets and appliances. However, when <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing options with his contractor</a>, he learned that the dividing wall was non-load-bearing. Removing the wall would let light into the living room from two directions. He put together a lengthy list of &#8220;must-haves&#8221; and &#8220;nice-to-haves&#8221; (from wall demolition all the way down to soft-close cabinets). The same approach was used to bring light and modern appeal to the crumbling bathroom.</p>

<h3>An IKEA kitchen fit the budget</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lee took on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gut remodel of the kitchen</a> with the determination of a tech entrepreneur. He spent a month talking to every cabinet maker in NYC before accepting that even the lowest price for a high-end, custom-built set was way <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beyond his budget</a>. Even the next tier down felt costly, and the slightly more budget-friendly options at big-box retailers didn&#8217;t seem like an obvious slam dunk. After reading positive reviews about IKEA cabinets, and realizing that a whole new IKEA line was about to hit the market, he found himself psyched by the look of the white, high-gloss lacquer Sektion option.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-27638 size-full" title="close-up of kitchen drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-10.jpg" alt="IKEA kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="702" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-10-300x211.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-10-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The cost-benefit of <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/galley-kitchen-renovation-jackson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installing IKEA kitchen cabinets</a> for a completely new look was immediately evident: for well under $10K, Lee got a full set of high gloss kitchen cabinets <em>and</em> was really happy with the quality. The downside? Getting delivery right took weeks of follow-up and re-shipments to get all of the pieces on site. It was a great deal overall, but most definitely not without headaches and hand-holding.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27651 size-full" title="IKEA kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-06.jpg" alt="IKEA kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="713" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-06-300x214.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-06-600x428.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>

<p>Lee&#8217;s research paid off in other parts of the kitchen. He loved the look of white marble and spent six months on the hunt for a quartz countertop with a similar feel, ultimately landing on a porcelain slab by Euro West with an almost-identical yet indestructible effect. (Don&#8217;t miss our guide to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/popular-types-of-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comparing countertop materials</a> for your own kitchen!)</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27652 size-full" title="IKEA kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-08.jpg" alt="IKEA kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="715" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-08-300x215.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-08-600x429.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To stay on budget, Lee decided to skip a typical tiled backsplash. With the newly-opened room, and with an upper row of cabinets only on one side, it ended up being a smart choice. Lee thought carefully about cabinet placement<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>drawers only along the left (16&#8243; depth to maximize open space) and a slim row of upper cabinets centered on the right. The team installed the counter-depth Liebherr fridge against the back wall and lined up all other appliances: a Samsung stove, a stainless steel Blomberg dishwasher, and a Blanco Quatrus sink on the opposite side. Their placement left plenty of room in all directions for food prep and hosting.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27630 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-01.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1413" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-01-212x300.jpg 212w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-01-600x848.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>Starting from scratch for the bathroom refresh</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As soon as Lee <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started this project</a>, he knew he had little sentimental feelings about the bathroom. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan for the bathroom</a> was straightforward: Everything had to go. In its place, the room would receive a lot of clean, bright whites and crisp glass. He selected a touchless San Souci Kohler toilet, &#8220;designed for OCD people,&#8221; in his words, and a Kohler recessed medicine cabinet above the Fresca sink vanity. The bathroom hardware is all Hansgrohe; a full shower suite with all of its bells and whistles. Lee&#8217;s heavy research brought in one more big catch: he found a specialty <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frameless glass shower door</a> from Mirage Shower Doors that eliminates the slight green aura that lots of shower doors end up with. Glassos white wall tiles were the final reflective touch.</p>
