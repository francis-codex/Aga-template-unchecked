<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting started on commercial renovations can be both an exciting and overwhelming time. Perhaps you’re launching a business you’ve been dreaming about for a long time, or, if that dream has already proven successful, you’re expanding (congratulations!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches business owners to the best general contractors and helps the renovation stay on track, offers these guidelines for taking on commercial renovations, whether you are gearing up for an office build-out, a restaurant, retail space or some other venture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We based this article on New York City, but it has relevance to wherever you are in the country. The majority of US states base their codes on guidelines from the International Code Council. Cities and towns also have similar procedures when it comes to requirements such as building permits and Certificate of Occupancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few ways to get a head start with your own research. For example, taking a look at your potential building&#8217;s Certificate of Occupancy (CO) or browsing through online building records to get an idea of existing violations. Once you are seriously considering either buying or leasing a property or renovating what you have, that’s the right time to bring in a pro—an engineer, an architect, or a good or knowledgeable general contractor—so there are no surprises down the road.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few things to consider before unleashing the sledgehammer, and in some cases, signing a lease.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40003 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/HowSweetenWorks.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="50" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review the certificate of occupancy</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Number one, two, and three on your checklist before even committing to a lease should be: check the CO, check the CO, and check the CO. The document shows what you can legally use a property for—an office, a private residence, a restaurant, etc. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Here’s a <a href="https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/bsqpm01.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> to search in New York City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changing a CO is a costly process and, in some cases, it’s impossible to shift it to another use, according to Mercedes Hernandez from S&amp;M Expediting. Expediters are an optional addition to your building team to speed up the slow grind of permits, especially for commercial renovations in bureaucratic cities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We get a lot of calls after the fact when they start the process of getting necessary licenses. That’s when they realize they have a problem,” she said. One client signed a lease with the intention of turning a space into a gym. However, the certificate did not allow for a health club in the premises. That client is still trying to change it and it has already been 12 months. The easiest route is to lease or buy a space where the CO fits your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COs can also dictate smaller issues. For example, if you want to use the property’s backyard for additional restaurant seating, the certificate needs to specify that this is allowable. Otherwise, the CO will need <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/cofo_guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updating</a>. Smaller additions such as this are a much easier fix than a change in the legal use of a property, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><br />Understand existing violations on your property</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Especially if the property you’re eyeing hasn’t changed hands or had a new tenant for some time, it’s possible it already has building violations. It could be that someone did work without a permit, installed a rooftop AC unit incorrectly, or the fire sprinkler system isn’t functioning. “When you go to get a permit, these things are scrutinized and discovered,” explained <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. If the violations aren’t corrected, that could mean a costly stop-work order on your construction project later on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To kickstart this process, like COs, city councils often keep online databases where you can search open violations, when a permitted job was last completed on a building, and what that job was. Complaints about the building—such as work without a permit or a business operating without the correct CO—might also give you a hint at what violations you could encounter. The good news is with a commercial lease it is common to get these violations taken care of by the landlord, but the lease needs to specify this, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While you might get a sense of a building’s open violations from your own research, it’s unlikely you will spot every one of them on your own. The best plan is to walk through a potential location for your business with an architect, engineer or a GC, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Mark</a>, another Sweeten general contractor. That pro will help you decide if a property is a workable fit for your vision, he said. It’s also something that pros often do as a complimentary service to potential clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you need to determine if your property can handle the weight of your business. And in some cases, we mean that quite literally. Hernandez’s example illustrates the point: if you want to flip a clothing retail space into a car showroom, it’s a wise idea to make sure the floor can support the added weight. Or how about creating an open-plan office that’s perfect for teamwork? Before drawing up those plans, you need to know what walls are load-bearing and if they can be moved. If moving that wall (or not) is a deal breaker, it’s best to know the capabilities of a space before signing on the dotted line. “You need to ask what are the limits of design,” said Sweeten contractor Colin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessing the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEPs) situation is crucial especially if you’re turning a space into a food establishment with a kitchen. Gas, plumbing and electrical will be under more pressure, so can the property’s existing infrastructure handle it, or is an extensive overhaul required? If it is, prepare your budget and timeline realistically. That’s <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/nycbe/downloads/pdf/nycstarter_guide_restaurant.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another reason</a> besides the existing CO that some business owners take the express route of leasing a property that was previously a restaurant. While it&#8217;s not a given everything will be up to code (don’t forget those existing violations), it is easier and cheaper than starting from scratch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39363" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01.jpg" alt="Babeland storefront" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/babeland-retail-commercial-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A retail renovation</a> in Downtown New York by Sweeten contractor <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Checking on a building&#8217;s envelope</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An envelope is building speak for whatever separates the outside from the inside—windows, doors, roof, etc. It’s another area worth looking into before starting your project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessibility for the disabled is often overlooked. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair. While many older buildings may have had their compliance grandfathered in, major commercial renovations could <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2006/rpt/2006-R-0335.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trigger</a> the need for properties to line up with the ADA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other areas that could change the scope of your project include asbestos in window glazing, which would need to be replaced. A property that is a landmark or in a historic district could also <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/lpc/index.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impact</a> if and how you can alter your building’s facade, including doors and windows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What are your facility requirements?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most health codes will require an employer to provide access to toilet facilities. For offices, this could mean a shared bathroom on a floor, according to Hernandez, the expediter. “They have to make sure employees have access to a bathroom from within the building,” she said. One client suggested sending employees to another building, but this was not permitted under the health code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The size of a food establishment will likely determine how many bathrooms are required for patrons (some sort of bathroom access is always required for employees). In 2012, New York City actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/nyregion/rule-shift-cuts-restroom-requirements-at-new-york-restaurants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowered</a> the required bathrooms, permitting small cafes, restaurants, and bars with fewer than 31 seats to have one bathroom, not two. Those with fewer than 20 seats are <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not</a> required to provide a bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like any project, commercial renovations that are well planned and equipped with the right team of people can be exciting. Just be sure to consider these five areas early to keep your renovation on the straight and narrow.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064728861"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>What is a certificate of occupancy?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A certificate of occupancy (CO) is a document that details what someone can legally use a property for, and the limits to which the property can be changed for that use. For example, a CO could state that a property can be used as an office, a private residence, or a restaurant. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Sometimes, it is possible to change a CO to cover a different use, but this can be costly and time-consuming.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064746876"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to renovate a commercial building</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">First, review the certificate of occupancy. This will tell you what you are legally allowed to use the building for (an office space, a residence, a gym, etc.) Then, research whether there are any existing violations on the property. Review the space with an architect or contractor, and check for unpermitted work. Also review the structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work. Will you be able to move walls? Can the current flooring support your business use? Make sure the building’s envelope–the windows, doors, and roof–are in good working condition. Consider people with disabilities. Is there a way for wheelchair users to enter the building? Lastly, understand your facility requirements, like mandatory bathrooms.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03-600x400.jpg" alt="conference office table" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone wp-image-45503" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>(Above) A <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/an-nyc-office-renovation-to-expand-working-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new commercial office remodel with Sweeten</a> for an NYC-based tech brand</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps you have outgrown your home office or coworking space or maybe your business is in need of a fresh location or configuration. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office renovation</a> will give you a chance to dream long-term about where your business is heading and interpret that direction into blueprints for a space that will facilitate growth. In this guide, we&#8217;ll consider the many pieces of your office renovation cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An office renovation can be as simple as an improvement project that is negotiated between the landlord and the tenant before signing a lease. Often these are very basic renovations such as fresh paint and some new walls that the tenant ultimately pays for in the cost of the lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are after something more custom, there are, of course, many variables that will determine the cost per square foot. Is the location a new or old building? Was it previously an office? What part of the country will your office be in? What are your business needs? And what quality of work will match those needs?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new building with a basic build-out of carpet, paint, and lighting, including equipment such as a photocopier and coffee machine costs about $40 a square foot, according to <a href="https://42floors.com/us/nv/las-vegas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42Floors</a>, a national search engine listing real estate for office space. On the higher end of the scale, a build-out with finishes such as wood veneer doors and a stone reception desk could hit $100 to $150 a square foot. The office renovation cost could also increase if you are renovating in an older building where quirky spaces and issues, such as slanted floors, must be taken into account. Whatever your tastes and needs, here are budget line items to consider.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs to hire an architect for an office renovation </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people will choose to hire an architect or designer. Expect that to take 20 percent of your renovation budget, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Carla</a>. That could mean $40,000 of a $200,000 budget. Bringing in a design professional early on may save heartaches in the long run. Along with the overall look and feel of the project, architects can also take care of code issues, assess if the workspace size will be comfortable for the number of employees, ensure handicap accessibility, design custom work areas, and more. “You can express creativity and individuality,” said Carla.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office lighting and electrical costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While planning an office remodel, first consider who will be coming to your office, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3218">Anthony, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. If clients are making regular visits, “you don’t want it to look like you’re working out of a bomb shelter,” he said. Decent lighting is one of those elements you can use to impress your clients, an impression that will hopefully lead to more business. Basic lighting can cost about $250 a point (a light with a switch is considered two points), according to Anthony. For each 110 volt outlet, put $150 in your budget, and don’t forget things like lighting for emergency exit signs, which are about $300 each, according to the website <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Move Your Office</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for millwork and finishes in an office</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is another area where you can keep costs down while still wowing potential clients with your new office space. “I’ve done work in lawyer&#8217;s offices where inside it is a vanilla box with cubicles that the clients never see,” said Anthony. “Then you have a lobby and conference room that is decked out with custom woodwork and imported marble.” One sample office budget at Buildings.com put the cost of millwork and finishes at about $25 a square foot. The total office renovation cost for that build-out came to $90 a square foot.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWIyD5_VuQ8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40888 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs to build walls</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similar to lighting and millwork, walls can differ greatly in cost. A basic partition wall that is ten linear square feet could cost around $60. Glass walls are not often priced per square foot and are instead sold as a package. However, using executive design elements such as glass walls could push the entire cost of your office renovation towards the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/64oqcghu49v4txd/Kirksey_ConstructionCostUpdate_2015_0.pdf?dl=0%20Paint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$150 </a>a square foot range.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office flooring costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commercial-grade carpet or a vinyl tile can cost <a href="https://naiglobal.com//journal_item_attachments/000/551/662/original/construction_costs.pdf?1421682262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as little</a> as $4 a square foot to supply and install. Wood plank floors can <a href="https://www.remodelingexpense.com/costs/cost-of-plank-flooring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost</a> around $7 a square foot for a 5,000-square-foot office. If there will be an industrial theme in your new office, then concrete flooring might be an economical option starting at $2 a square foot, according to the <a href="https://www.concretenetwork.com/concrete/interiorfloors/cost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concrete Network</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office bathroom costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many office buildings will have a communal bathroom area on each floor for tenants. If there is no bathroom, you must install at least one. <a href="https://americanrestroom.org/the-united-states-code-of-federal-regulations-for-toilet-facilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US code</a> requires one bathroom per one to 15 staff members. That climbs to six bathrooms for 111 to 150 staff.  A single restroom could cost a little under $15,000, according to <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Move Your Office</a>. If your staff likes to shower at work after jogging or riding into the office, a shower (make sure it is handicap friendly as per the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>), will cost just shy of $6,000.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office kitchen costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An office kitchen can help team members feel appreciated. In the office renovation cost outline at the end of this article, Sweeten contractor Anthony installed an office bathroom and kitchenette. The total budget for those two items was around $16,000. The kitchenette, which consisted of a sink and fridge, took about 25 percent or $4,000 of that budget. Because the kitchenette and the bathroom were near each other, the project made double use of the plumbing to reduce overall costs. “It really depends on how much plumbing and millwork you need,” said Anthony. “You could have a simple cabinet or a whole countertop with a microwave, fridge, and sink.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fire protection</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on the building you are leasing, this could (hopefully) already be in place. If there is a sprinkler system, it is well worth spending a few hundred dollars to have an engineer inspect it to ensure it works and that it is up to current code. Installing a system from scratch in a small to a medium-sized office could set you back between $5,000 to $10,000, according to Anthony. He estimates that a sprinkler system will cost about $200 per sprinkler head, plus an additional $2,000 to have a plan drawn up as well as permits and inspections.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HVAC for offices</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping an office well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature can have a big impact on employee productivity. So, installing an HVAC—heating ventilation and air conditioning system—might be worth it if there isn’t already one in your new location. An HVAC system could cost between $15 to almost $30 a square foot or 15 to 20 percent of your entire office renovation cost, according to the Builder’s Association.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Labor costs for an office remodel </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a typical office renovation, labor should take about <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ten percent</a> of your entire budget. However, consider the geographic differences in labor costs. For example, the cost of labor in New York City is 70 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/costs/kitchen-remodeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr</a>. Philadelphia is 40 percent and Dallas ten percent above the national average. Charleston, South Carolina, and Scottsdale, Arizona, are both one percent below the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certain factors in individual cities can add another variable. For example, in New York City, there are union and non-union buildings. For union buildings, tenants are required to use union labor, which can almost double the office renovation cost of a project, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. The basic build-out of an office in a non-labor building can be as little as $40 a square foot or as much as $100 a square foot in a labor building, according to <a href="https://42floors.com/edu/space-buildout/gauging-the-cost-of-an-office-build-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42Floors</a>.</p>

<p><em>With roots in upscale hospitality, such as Eleven Madison Park and The Thomas Keller Restaurant Group, Sandra Di Capua and Anthony Rudolf, along with Jennie Monness, saw a gap in the kind of playtime offerings they wanted for their own children.

They turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> for a general contractor with the expertise and communication skills they were looking for.

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What is Union Square Play?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> Union Square Play is a place for local families. We both have kids and have been in New York for a long time. We wanted to have a space where families could come with their three-year-olds and under—a place to play, take classes, and get out of the weather.</p>

<p><strong>Sandra:</strong> When we opened the play space, it was a result of us having children of our own and living in a neighborhood to find that what was out there wasn&#8217;t perfect for us. So we really built it for ourselves. You could drop in for classes, engage with other parents and other children, and most importantly it’s a place where children could be in a space that was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong>  How did your Sweeten general contractor help you realize your vision?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> The ceilings aren&#8217;t super high but we knew that making it all white and beautiful would make it feel safe, home-y and just, useable. That was really the biggest thing for us. We worked with the bones of the space and didn&#8217;t do major architectural structural changes. Our contractor allowed us to brighten everything up and make it feel fresh. He came in on budget, which was hugely important.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you come to Sweeten? Did you work with Client Services?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> It was our first time using the Sweeten platform. I had a contractor I used exclusively on four or five spaces that I&#8217;ve built out in the past. He came a little over [budget] from what I was hoping to pay to build out [this play space]. So I said, “Okay, let&#8217;s give Sweeten a try and see if we can find a new contractor.” Early on, Client Services helped us with the process. We got five or six bids in, they helped us with the proper timing and decision process, and when to go back and bid for more. Once we selected our Sweeten contractor, it was smooth sailing from there.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do you think Sweeten could help other entrepreneurs like yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Sandra: </strong>I think this process can be really intimidating. If you&#8217;ve never done a build out before, or even if you have, every project is different, and if you don&#8217;t have a super tight relationship with the contractor, or even if you do, you are always trying to figure out, “Am I getting charged properly?” “What&#8217;s the timeline supposed to be?” “What&#8217;s realistic or not?” With a platform like Sweeten, you get to compare different bids, get a feel for contractors&#8217; past work and budget, and what&#8217;s feeling out of my comfort zone or what’s feeling on point?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> It was also just getting to meet as many people as we got to meet through the platform; I think in one day we had eight people come through, which was just insane. The amount of effort it would take you to find, source, and schedule eight appointments is a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What was important for you to find in a general contractor?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> Communication style and having good camaraderie. The relationship is critically important. I think that&#8217;s where our Sweeten contractor thrived. On the commercial side, there is typically capital investment that needs to get a return and every dollar counts. So we needed to get [to the end of the renovation] as fast as possible to start making money and start paying it back. We needed to do it as efficiently as possible. Not only was the contractor on site and knew the light fixtures and the nuts and bolts, but his partner was office-based and was our main point of contact where we were able to go back and forth. Things not only moved faster, but stayed on budget and we got the paperwork through very quickly.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting a business is both daunting and exciting. It could mean that you will finally be your own boss, or have a chance to execute on an idea that has beckoned you for years. But that good idea and that excitement do not pay the bills. It will take some meticulous planning to get through a business renovation and end up with an enterprise that not only feeds your soul but pushes your business into the black.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">About 80 percent of small businesses fail in their first year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. One of the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/small-business-central/2017/05/21/what-percentage-of-businesses-fail-in-their-first-year/101260716/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest reasons</a>? They get to the end of their budget by either not making a profit or underestimating the amount of time and capital they will need before crossing over into a profitable business. At <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, we want to see every business succeed. It’s one of the reasons why we offer a free service connecting business owners with fully vetted general contractors when it&#8217;s time to start or expand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are a few ways to make sure you don&#8217;t burn through your business&#8217;s renovation budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-40003 size-full aligncenter" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/HowSweetenWorks.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="50" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Minimize change orders with precise planning</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jimmy Haber knows a thing or two about successfully surviving a business renovation. His company, <a href="https://e2hospitality.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esquared</a>, has a long list of successful restaurants, including the popular vegan dining chain <a href="https://eatbychloe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by CHLOE</a>. For Jimmy, the biggest disrupter to a budget is change orders. These can occur once the scope of work and budget are agreed upon by business owner and contractor, serving up an unexpected addition to the cost and complexity of a project. “A change order can happen for a thousand different reasons,” he said. “It could be as simple as ‘that outlet doesn’t belong there. It is better if it is here.’” Or more complicated such as needing to redo a design feature that doesn’t quite look right or drawing up a budget from a preliminary set of plans rather than a final set.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“You have to go through and meticulously plan everything out,” said Jimmy. Not only will the change order likely add to your budget, since you’re already in agreement with your contractor, it is more difficult to get a competitive price on that additional scope of work. “Because they already have the job, you no longer have any leverage, but they do,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Contingency for staff costs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having a delay in a construction project once new staff already has a start date will put any business owner in a dilemma. If you let those staff members go, then you&#8217;ll have to go through the time-consuming process of re-hiring replacements once you are ready to open. Or, if you want to secure the team you&#8217;ve hired, keeping them on the payroll might be the only way to stop them from going elsewhere. “This can be the most painful and difficult stage that can crush your budget,” said Jimmy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One solution is to be prepared with a contingency line item in the budget for staff costs in the case that construction is delayed and you’ve already hired your staff. Other times it might mean holding on to key staff, like executive chef for a restaurant or a general manager for a retail space, while letting go of those in high turnover positions such as servers.</p>

<p><strong>Keep a line of credit handy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just like a lifebuoy in a pool area, a line of credit should be ready to go if your project needs additional cash to stay afloat, said Andrew Flamm. He is the director of the <a href="https://www.pacesbdc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pace University Small Business Development Center,</a> which connects small business owners with funding as well as support and mentorship. A line of credit is different from a typical term loan. With a term loan, once you are approved you receive it in a lump sum and begin paying interest on it immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A line of credit requires approval; however, it remains in the lender&#8217;s possession. You only access it if and when you need to. You also only begin paying interest on the loan once you start using it and you don’t need to draw on the entire amount available to you. Only take what you need. “Then you are not scrambling to pay a bill or overextending on your credit card,” said Andrew. “That could have implications on your credit score and affect future funding down the road.” Lines of credit usually have a slightly higher interest rate than a term loan, but it could save your business and your personal credit score if you get into a bind.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare to pay operating costs early</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One area that trips up many new businesses is forgetting operating costs while a renovation is in progress, according to Alek Marfisi, a small business consultant with <a href="https://upwindstrategies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upwind Strategies</a>. If you’re building out a space, you will still need to pay utility bills like gas and electricity, internet connection, business liability insurance, and property insurance. Having plenty of temporary working capital on hand is a must for these situations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40462 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Dan-Nelken-UnionSq-Lobby-19.jpg" alt="lobby" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Dan-Nelken-UnionSq-Lobby-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Dan-Nelken-UnionSq-Lobby-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Dan-Nelken-UnionSq-Lobby-19-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Dan-Nelken-UnionSq-Lobby-19-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/union-square-lobby-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A residential lobby renovation</a> in Union Square by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Tim</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Temporary working capital</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition to the contingency funds you need to have to pay for overruns in the cost of construction, you should have enough temporary working capital <span class="s1">to cover at least two months of operating expenses should the construction project take longer than planned. This is p</span></span>art of your entire budget for working capital, and is what helps you handle any unexpected costs compared to permanent working capital, which is what you typically need to run your business. “It will get you through the losses from starting or expanding your business and while you’re not making any money,” said Alek. Temporary working capital covers the construction period and the period of time <span class="s1">in which the business is losing money before it breaks even.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with so many other expenses, these operating costs will need to be paid regardless of whether your renovation project runs on schedule or gets delayed. That’s why these costs should also be factored into a contingency plan in case your opening date gets bumped back.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Managing a successful renovation in your business comes down to detailed planning. Plus, it’s never a bad thing to be overly generous with your contingency line item in your budget so you are ready if something goes wrong. And if it all goes to plan, then there&#8217;s more capital to invest back into your dream business.</p>
