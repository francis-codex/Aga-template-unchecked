<h3>Keeping their Jackson Heights remodel in view<span>—for years</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">We purchased our co-op roughly three years before embarking on the renovation. Our goal was to totally revamp the apartment into open-plan spaces, while preserving its period features. Like many pre-war homes, it had a lot of small rooms. I think our result is proof that, even if there’s no perfect moment to remodel, intensive planning pays off.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Keeping historic details</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The 1,400-square-foot unit is located in a 1921 historical-district co-op in Jackson Heights, Queens. The place hadn’t been touched since the 1970s and was in rough shape. But there were nice original details, like beautiful wood floors with inlaid borders and a period fireplace. It needed a significant overhaul.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Dia and I didn’t rush it. We’d rented in the neighborhood for a couple of years to make sure we liked the area—and we did. After finding the co-op, we wanted to take our time and put our stamp on it. We spent almost two years planning the remodel. By the time we were ready to proceed, Dia was pregnant with our daughter, Madeleine. We were eager to get the job done, and ready to pick up the pace. </span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">In-depth research and planning </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/50730" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project</a> on Sweeten. We made clear in our overview that we were ready to obtain our co-op board approvals, navigate the permitting, order materials, and get started. By then we’d spent a lot of time planning the layout, materials, and finishes. We had 40 pages of diagrams, renderings, and materials lists. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Five or six Sweeten contractors came for site visits and gave us estimates. Right away, one stood out. He had printed out our mammoth set of plans (which he jokingly referred to as “the bible”), came armed with excellent questions, spoke knowledgeably about what would and would not be possible given NYC building codes, and gave us a detailed and reasonable estimate. We knew immediately that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we wanted to hire him</a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">A gut remodel with an extensive to-do list </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Going in, we made sure the contractor understood that we had a specific vision, and that we were demanding. We planned to open the kitchen, living, and dining rooms, build a modern kitchen, renovate both bathrooms to spa standards, and add closet space. At the same time, we intended to keep original details, and even increase them by adding period chandeliers and other fixtures that would complement the co-op’s 1920s style.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07.jpg" alt="Dark blue built-in cabinets and shelving with white counter" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52013" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Kitchen-Closet-01.gif" alt="Built-in kitchen closet storage with doors opening and closing" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52006" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Our renovation scope was specific. It included replacing and relocating the breaker box, and installing new switches and sockets. We wanted to remove several unnecessary walls, and rebuild two walls and two water-damaged window encasements. We requested new baseboards and crown moldings. In the kitchen, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned to add a peninsula</a>, a custom pantry, and a sideboard. We wanted to build closets in the bedrooms and entryway, as well as custom cabinets and radiator covers. We’d paint every room and refinish the floors.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Problem solving with the general contractor team</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Several miracles occurred in the kitchen. When we removed a wall to make way for the new peninsula, it resulted in a break in the floor inlay, but the floor subcontractor recreated the </span><span class="s2">multi-wood pattern so skillfully that you can’t tell what is original and what is new. Our appliance vendor’s repeated delivery delays caused a need for our countertops to be installed before the appliances. Our Sweeten contractor got them in when they arrived, despite incredible difficulty—installing our refrigerator even required removing the baseboard temporarily.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2">When our single-piece sideboard countertop was too big for the elevator, the guys carried them up five flights of stairs. And when the new electrical box occupied the former microwave place, the cabinetmaker came up with a built-in pantry, designed with an interior cutout to fit the oven.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In our bathroom, we had other inspired solutions. We wanted to move the toilet but a steel beam prevented placement in the new rough-in location. Our contractor proposed a wall-hung toilet that freed up space for it to stay in the original location and squeezed in a vanity, which wasn’t possible with the traditional commode. Thanks to supply-chain disruptions during Covid-19, we ended up sourcing bathroom tile other than that from our original wishlist—and the manufacturer offered no coordinating trim. Our general contractor found a trim that matched and drove more than 700 miles to collect every piece they could find.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Homeowners share their renovation advice</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">As first-time renovators, our biggest questions from the beginning were about how to manage the many subcontractors and aspects of the work happening simultaneously. But our Sweeten contractor pulled it all together. Our initial instincts about planning carefully were validated, but the process also taught us to always have a Plan B. We certainly learned the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweeten-renovator-reviews-10-things-they-loved-about-their-general-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">value of picking the right contractor</a>—one who inspires confidence and keeps your best interests at heart.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2">We couldn’t have asked for a more professional and dedicated team. At the start, he helped us gather the necessary co-op board sign-offs and connected us with an architect. He managed the permitting process seamlessly, despite NYC Department of Buildings changes during Covid-19. At every step, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our general contractor</a> went above and beyond to help us realize our vision.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">I’m not sure anyone comes in under budget in a renovation. We didn’t, but we stayed </span><span class="s2">roughly in line with our expectations. There was a payoff, in any case. Our beautiful result! Even having done the project six months after having our baby and during a pandemic, we feel peaceful. We are in love with our home.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Monique</span></i></p>
<h3>Moving from co-op to a house</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After living in Brooklyn for nine years, I decided to move back to Queens in search of more space and a slice of the outdoors. I purchased a 1,300-square-foot attached brick rowhouse from the ‘40s. It had a small front patio where I could sit and drink my coffee on the weekends, plus a small front garden to plant vegetables and do some xeriscaping (landscaping that requires little or no irrigation).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="happy-homeowner-dining-area" class="alignnone wp-image-50383 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-20-2.jpg" alt="happy homeowner in the dining area with white round table after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-20-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-20-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-20-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50364 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01.jpg" alt="Image of the exterior of a brick Queens rowhouse" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, the purpose of the purchase and subsequent renovation was to create a sanctuary where I could relax after a long day of work. I wanted to make sure to bring in the things that I had loved about my Brooklyn brownstone co-op, while enjoying and making good use of my new space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always wanted to live in a Craftsman cottage but knew I couldn’t find this style of building in New York City. Instead, I decided I would incorporate cottage-style elements into my interior design choices. A few things would need to be changed immediately; there were lime green walls in the bedroom and a vibrant orange hallway. I also wanted to rip up the linoleum and carpet floors, replace the house’s original windows, and update the kitchen, bathroom, and entryway.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h3>Spicing up the entry</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">entryway </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was very important to me. Moving from an apartment to a house, I could now fully set the tone that welcomed everyone into my home. The entryway had been functional, but bland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="patterned-tiles-entryway" class="alignnone wp-image-50365 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1.jpg" alt="patterned tiles at entryway with two wooden doors after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-wallpaper-entryway-blue-door" class="alignnone wp-image-50406 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23.jpg" alt="white wallpaper in entryway with blue door and blue patterend floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I added some touches that brought the outside in and made me smile whenever I opened the front door. I chose to custom design the steel front door in a Craftsman style that felt warm and inviting. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the flooring</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, white-and-blue handmade cement tiles added a lot of personality. I didn’t want the walls to pale in comparison to the bold floor, so I found a textured and paintable wallpaper that mimicked an abstracted cloud design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-room-separator-brown-floor-tile" class="alignnone wp-image-50368 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-05-1.jpg" alt="white room separator with passageway to room on one side and the living room on another with brown floor tile after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-05-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-05-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="wooden-flooring-white-living-room" class="alignnone wp-image-50367 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-04-1.jpg" alt="wooden flooring in white living room with blue couch after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-04-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-04-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-04-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I didn’t have enough space for a grand entrance, I still wanted to make a statement for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">front entry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by using a modern fixture and opening up the arch to double the size in the living room.</span></p>
<h3>Design elements to make it truly home</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized how important incorporating the outdoors into the space was for me. When I was a kid, we couldn’t really afford to renovate the wood-paneled walls that were in my bedroom. Instead, my mom gave my room a woodland theme and installed green carpet that was the color of grass and would encourage me to take off my socks so we could play barefoot in the “grass” together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-room-black-couch-wooden-floor" class="alignnone wp-image-50369 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1.jpg" alt="white room with black couch and white pendant light and wooden flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-living-room-blue-couch" class="alignnone wp-image-50372 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1.jpg" alt="white living room with blue and red couch and white floor rug on wooden floor and large window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was so excited when my Sweeten general contractor suggested I install European tilt-and-turn-style windows. You can open them all the way and really feel like you are inviting in the outdoors. We were able to remove the linoleum and carpet throughout the house and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stain the wood floors</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> underneath. I debated going with a modern, gray stain, but ultimately decided on a timeless walnut that felt more appropriate to the cottage style. I loved the original </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">built-in shelves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the living room, so I just asked for the design elements at the top to be cut off, which made the built-ins feel timeless versus dated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-black-counter" class="alignnone wp-image-50377 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-14.jpg" alt="white kitchen with black countertop and closed kitchen cabinets with handles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Form and function for a Cottage-style kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kitchen,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I decided to mix cooler colors and neutrals like blues, whites, and grays, balanced with a bit of warmth from some champagne bronze accents. I wanted a certain set of cabinet pulls that were too expensive for my budget, but was thrilled to find a similar version for a third of the price.</span></p>
<h3>Small kitchen details made the difference</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was these kinds of details that really started to matter to me throughout the process. I spent hours looking at doorknobs and faucets, which I hadn’t expected. I didn’t realize how much I would want a say in every design choice and how much I would care about all the little details that were going into my home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I have room to eat in the kitchen. My contractor transformed a small broom closet in the hallway into a pull-out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pantry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It stores all of my dry goods and is so space-efficient. Without it, that closet would have held trash bags and a Swiffer, but now I use every inch of that space for my spices, peanut butter, and pancake mix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One small accent that was a big deal for me was the ceramic crackle push plates for the swinging doors between the kitchen and the bedroom. I’m a big fan of British television and had been inspired by the homes in shows I watch. It was hard to find this kind of push plate in the U.S., so I ended up having them imported from England. I was so nervous about them making it over in one piece, but they did, and I’m so glad I was able to incorporate them into my space. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of my decisions were functional, but everyone thought I was crazy when I installed wainscoting in my very tight </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">powder room</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I understand why—the wainscoting literally took away space—but I went for it anyway. As a trade-off, I saved space with a corner toilet and a size-appropriate sink. I am really happy with how it turned out.</span></p>
<h3>Remodeling with peace-of-mind</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t really need to take up Sweeten’s check-ins during the renovation. It was reassuring, though, to know they were there should issues come up, as this was my first major home renovation. It gave me peace of mind—like that optional purchase protection on a big product purchase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a first-time renovator, I wasn’t sure how long everything would take or how involved I would be in the process. I was glad that I was able to be involved in most of the decisions, even though I <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work full-time and couldn’t be physically</a> present all day. I don’t know how working people managed projects like this before email!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My renovated space feels like a peaceful retreat. I love how welcoming and warm it feels for my friends and their kids to come and hang out. My contractor understood my vision and now I’m able to relax and fully be myself in this new space.</span></p>

<li class="li2"><span class="s3"><strong>Architect:</strong> Can Vu Bui and Lane Rick, principal architects at the Office of Things, and in collaboration with architect Matthew Storrie, found a general contractor by <span class="s4">posting the </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/43173#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s4">1920s rowhouse project</span></a><span class="s4"> </span>on Sweeten<br />

<li><strong>Architect&#8217;s quote:</strong> <span class="s1">“As architects, we spend a lot of time designing custom details—our relationships with the contractors who can make them are critical. It’s great to work with craftspeople who bring insight and expertise to the project.”</span></li>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Opening up a claustrophobic layout</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Be patient and be bold,” Can Vu Bui, a Brooklyn principal at <a href="https://oo-t.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of Things</a>, a collaborative architecture and design studio, likes to tell his clients. This was his mantra going into the main floor gut renovation of an Art Deco–era rowhouse in Glendale, Queens. Bui’s slow, steady approach led to a striking result.</span></p>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<h5></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The homeowners had been living in the home when they hired Bui, and were ready for dramatic change on the brick building’s first floor. They planned on revising the existing layout to bring air and light to a chronically dreary space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After coming up with a concept reflecting light modernism,</span><span class="s1"> Bui created a project plan and posted the job on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our website</a>. They worked with the homeowner to review bids and portfolios before hiring a contracting firm in Queens.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Starting out, the team had their work cut out for them. “The house’s primary problem was a direct product of its 1920s design,” the architect said. The brick-and-mortar building, surrounded by townhomes, had a narrow, chopped-up floor plan.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The challenges of opening the 600-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main floor space</a>, according to Bui, were abundant. A load-bearing masonry wall blocked light from reaching the living and dining rooms. Walls that separated the stair, kitchen, and dining area inhibited flow, creating “small, claustrophobic” spaces, he said.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">“We designed custom millwork that provided a pantry, cabinets, and a low bench.”</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51433 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03.jpg" alt="Image of the family room with black couch and arched entry to dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Art Deco-approved arches</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The light and space problems at the top of Bui’s task list were only the beginning. “This project presented an opportunity to fix those pragmatic issues,” he said, but also to pull together and “artfully unify” the divided ground floor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Door frames and wall openings were inconsistent, but the building held some inspiring original details. Fortunately, a few with gently rounded upper corners caught the architect’s eye.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bui envisioned sloping designs to link the spaces together. “We replaced existing walls with elegant structural arches,” the architect said. “The rooms open generously into each other, allowing light to pour into the home’s interior.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Stairs open up with storage</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite the desire for openness and light, maximum storage space was still needed for functionality and day-to-day life, particularly in New York City homes, according to Bui. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to his plan, the general contractor opened the wall between the existing stair and dining room, removing a large, square center section. Next, the contracting team revised the staircase, adding a landing a few steps from the base and then introducing a turn, so that the last few steps led into the dining room. The changes helped the narrow stairs and small dining room feel instantly less claustrophobic.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51448 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-18.jpg" alt="Image of an open stairway with custom storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-18-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-18-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51449 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19.jpg" alt="Image of built-in storage with drawers and cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the breaking through of the wall eliminated key storage space. Bui found a fix. “We designed <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom millwork</a>” surrounding the new wall opening, he says, “that provided a pantry, cabinets, and a low bench,” as well as custom handrails. In the end, a partially exposed stairway brings light and drama to the home.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Paint colors and bright finishes</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walls and the interior planes of the arches are painted in muted shades—green, ochre, and blue. Curved millwork is also seen on a full wall of open storage in the dining room. The brushed oak is stained with a hint of gold. Brass accents bring warmth to the rooms.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Many homeowners and designers fear color,” he said. “It makes sense—you don’t want to be stuck with the wrong one.” The architectural team worked closely with the homeowner throughout the process, providing renderings, tests, and mockups to prevent surprises. For instance, the shade of gold on the walls in the foyer and dining room carefully bookends the space without overwhelming or darkening the area.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The pale <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">green in the kitchen</a> and reading nook plays homage to classical French country homes,” Bui said. The effect is an inviting color path leading one through the house. “Our goal,” Bui said, “is to let color boldly elevate the feeling of a space.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Architect + Sweeten general contractor = Teamwork heaven</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout the process, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architect and Sweeten general contractor</a> worked together closely, executing Bui’s vision. “As architects, we spend a lot of time designing custom details—our relationships with the contractors who can make them are critical. It’s great to work with craftspeople who bring insight and <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/queens-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expertise to the project</a>.”</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the end, Bui explained, the renovation made over the once spiritless space—it feels bright and modern, but not harsh or humorless. Furthermore, color and flow now have a direct impact on the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comfort one feels in their surroundings</a>. “This is a home, after all,” Bui said. “It should feel special.”</span></p>

</ul>
<p><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowners</i></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">An empty room becomes a handicap accessible bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The family has lived in their colonial home in Saint Albans, Queens since 1975. The space was working for most of them, but the daughters’ aging mother needed a one-floor living situation so she wouldn’t have to go up and down the stairs to use the bathroom or kitchen. That meant converting an extra room on the first floor into a senior-friendly bathroom adjacent to her bedroom.</p>
<div></div>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-35989 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Adding a walk-in shower and ADA-compliant toliet</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the room was demolished, reframed, and equipped for plumbing, the family worked together to choose materials and products for the bathroom. The biggest consideration was the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass-encased</a> shower.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="ADA bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-44061 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-08-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="accessible bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-35991 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to build the frame for the shower, it was initially discussed that one of the back windows would have to be blocked off. Their contractor found another solution, adding a tiled extension off the existing half wall to support the glass.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-35996 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-35990 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Adjusting to make more room</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The radiator had to move down closer to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilet</a> to make room, too. The contractor also ensured the shower entry was large enough to fit a shower chair and made the entry curbless.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="curbless shower" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-35995 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-10-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Other accessible features included the disability bar inside, as well as the handle on the outside of the shower. The daughters wanted a convenient place for their mother to be able to hang her robe, so the contractor added a robe hook just outside the glass door.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="aging in place bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-35992 size-full" style="text-align: justify;" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Accessibility is key</h3>
<p>As for the other details, they decided on a cabinet vanity instead of a pedestal sink to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">optimize storage</a>, built a niche on the adjacent wall, and installed a higher, comfort-height 17-inch toilet that matches ADA-compliant standards. Accessibility was the most important consideration throughout the project and that need was definitely met. “Our contractor did a great job overall,” the family shared. “He came up with solutions and we worked through different ideas.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="accessible bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-35997 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Their contractor installed an easy-to-slide pocket door between the bedroom and bathroom.</p>

<p><em>Guest post by homeowner Michelle</em></p>
<h3>Finding the right contractors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My journey down the renovation rabbit hole began when I found myself picturing the dilapidated garage in the backyard as my dream “diva den,” as my best friend calls it. While researching different designs and models, I remembered an article on Sweeten I&#8217;d read a few years ago and had always wanted to use their services. It seemed like a no-brainer to have an intermediary help locate vetted contractors. It also solved the huge question of where to begin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since this was my first ever renovation project, I had no idea what my renovation would cost. Sweeten helped me modify my scope of work and nail down a realistic budget. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced me to a few contractors</a> who were a good match for my project. I finally felt like I had a team behind me, which is great once you start writing big checks.</p>

<h3>Planning the &#8220;she shed&#8221; garage remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I knew instantly that the first Sweeten contractor I met was the right fit for the job. Finally, I found someone as excited about my garage as I was! At that stage, I only had a basic idea of what I wanted. We took down most of the existing structure, retaining only the foundation. Since I was renovating a 12&#8242; x 19&#8242; garage, I wanted the interior to be basic and for the structure to retain the identity and functionality of a garage. That meant concrete floors, no molding, and a statement-making garage door. If you took out the rugs and furniture of the she shed, the structure could have use as a garage or workspace. I also wanted a calming space with one stipulation: no white walls.</p>
<h3>Experiencing a real-life renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with everyone on my contractor’s team was amazing. I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way. Most importantly, nobody exposed me for the complete novice that I was. Gaining an understanding of how everything worked also helped reign in some of my design ideas. To top off the contractor’s great service, he downloaded WhatsApp to stay in touch with me when I left for Cuba mid-project. I greatly appreciated his dedication to my peace of mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather was one of the biggest challenges during my project. It wasn’t an issue when my project started in August. However, when November arrived, it was either too cold, too rainy, or was supposed to rain but didn’t. Either way, there were a few bad weather days that halted work on The Shak. My contractor also had to juggle other clients. In my naiveté, I thought contractors worked on one project at a time. I came to understand that The Shak was my highest priority, but contractors work on other dream projects at the same time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25862 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-07-09.gif" alt="ladder to garage attic" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>Building a ladder to the attic</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the exterior took shape, and the interior work began, I became more involved in the project. That is also when my attention to detail heightened. For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage, we utilized the space</a>, we utilized the space above the ceiling. How to access that space became an hour-long discussion. I asked the contractor and his partner how I would get up to the storage space. &#8220;Use a ladder,&#8221; they said. &#8220;That’s what I do in my garage.&#8221; I’m no mathematician, but a nine-foot-tall ceiling plus a five-foot-tall girl does not equal easy movement of big boxes up a six-foot ladder. And where would I keep this ladder when I wasn’t using it? After a bit of selling on my part, they agreed to install an attic ladder. It was worth hashing out and in the end, my contractors loved the ladder too.</p>
<blockquote><p>I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Personalizing the &#8220;she shed&#8221; bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It may sound weird, but finding my dry-flush toilet was exciting. The she shed did not seem usable to me if you had to keep going into the house to use the bathroom. After endlessly searching for a toilet that did not need to be hooked up to sewage lines or have an odor, I came across a dry flush toilet. It is a great invention. It works like a Diaper Genie disposal system with a continuous bag that self-seals when “flushed,” then, a new portion of the bag opens for use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the bathroom is a small 3’ x 4’ space, I definitely wanted some over-the-top designs on the walls. I initially thought of using three-dimensional self-adhesive wall panels but decided against that since I wanted a mix of color and patterns. As a naturally curly-haired girl, the print I chose was a perfect fit for my preference of streamlined chaos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25844 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg" alt="garage bathroom remodel" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A tip on DIY wallpaper hanging</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, by the time I found the mural, the contractors had completed the interior space. So, my best friend and I enrolled in the university that is YouTube. After watching about twenty videos, we felt qualified to hang wallpaper, something neither of us had ever done before. I love what we accomplished, but some things take more skill and patience than she or I possess. I will never hang wallpaper again.</p>
<h3>Ultra-bold backsplash tiles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the contractor installed the sink and countertop, my <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next big project was the backsplash</a>. I wanted something different and eye-catching, something that would not bore me. I came across graffiti tiles but the designs weren&#8217;t bold enough. After feeling empowered with my new construction knowledge, I decided to decoupage my own tiles. We figured out the dimensions for the backsplash and measured out 5&#8242; x 2&#8242; worth of decoupage tiles as well as some purchased ones. It is one of my favorite things in The Shak. Now, when my friends come over, they all choose their favorite tile. I love how they invite interaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have never embarked on a project of this size. At times, it was scary. I would get a call at 8 a.m. from my contractor, asking <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which direction I wanted the French doors</a> to open or what size I wanted the windows to be, with no clue of how to respond. My advice to anyone starting a project would be to pick a contractor that listens to your ideas. It is also helpful to watch some YouTube videos, home improvement shows, or however else you like to educate yourself. The more a homeowner knows, the better he or she can direct the construction of their masterpiece. I couldn&#8217;t be happier with everything I accomplished in making The Shak a reality.</p>

<li class="li1"><span class="s1"></span><b>Homeowners:</b> Kate, and her husband Daniel posted their gallery kitchen renovation on Sweeten</li>

<li class="li1"><span class="s1"></span><b>Sweeten’s role:</b> Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keeping the gallery style</h3>
<p>Since<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/"> galley kitchens</a> are, by definition, usually small and narrow, renovators typically decide to open up the layout as much as possible when remodeling—whether it involves partially removing a wall or creating a passthrough. However, Daniel, a Culinary Director at Serious Eats and his wife, Kate (a director at <em>VICE</em>) decided to buck the trend and embrace their floor plan, updating it to make it a true chef&#8217;s kitchen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="669" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21198" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<p>There were some very visible problems that had to be addressed. The kitchen’s floor tiles had developed corrosive stains over time that could not be scrubbed clean, the cabinets extended to a generic height that wasted space, and some unfortunate layout decisions positioned an old, hulking fridge at the entryway. Worse, the fridge and stove footprints forced the right side of the galley into three abridged sections that were not useful for real food prep. On the other side, plumbing risers in the wall pushed one section of cabinetry out by a few inches, creating an odd corner in the middle of the countertop and adding a few inches of cabinet bulk right at eye level above the sink.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44783" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21173" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>In need of more functionality</h3>
<p>Design flaws aside, the room felt claustrophobic, so most visitors assumed that the problem was with the galley itself. Common in pre-war apartments, the dividing wall between the kitchen and dining room could conceivably have come down, and everyone asked about it. But Daniel and Kate found themselves advocating for preservation as the galley began to play a central role in their big-picture decision-making. Ultimately, Daniel felt really comfortable in a galley: It was like a residential approximation of a commercial restaurant line. Rather than lamenting its limits, he saw it as a pro’s set-up. Wherever you’re standing, everything is within reach!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel and Kate turned to </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for help in finding a design and build firm. They had saved up for this renovation and wanted it to be right—making their two-bedroom, pre-war apartment in Jackson Heights, New York, even more desirable.</span></p>

<h3>Perfecting the details</h3>
<p>The general contractor that Daniel and Kate found through Sweeten shared the couple&#8217;s vision, committing to getting the fridge out of the entryway as well as installing custom cabinets to expand storage vertically. Offset cabinets were traded in for open shelving above the sink.</p>
<p>Daniel also appreciated the contractor&#8217;s focus on design decisions like cabinet door orientation and space between features, freeing him up to get a few chef’s details exactly right. Daniel wanted to avoid putting the microwave in a prominent spot and was concerned about cleanliness in an above-stove location. It now lives on an open shelf underneath the counter, where it’s an accessible tool but not a visible feature.</p>

<h3>Custom kitchen cabinets</h3>
<p>The Sweeten contractor created a dedicated cabinet for cutting boards, and most pots and pans are found in pull-out sliding cabinets rather than stacked in drawers, so they take up less space but are still easily grabbed. A towel bar, mounted just below the counter by the sink, has become major real estate with S-hooks added for small items for hanging.</p>
<p>Daniel and Kate decided on marble hex tile for the floors. It brings a natural element of warmth with a shape that is familiar in homes of a similar era, and it bounces light from the kitchen window with a little glow. Color for the custom cabinets became a tortured decision. Daniel and Kate paid extra for additional cabinet samples when they found that paint swatches didn’t really help them envision different tones, and agreed on a navy finish that paired well with brass accents already in the home.</p>

<h3>A kitchen for cooks</h3>
<p>Daniel aimed for a real chef’s prep space with sections of cherry butcher block. It needs mineral oil but is otherwise not that hard to maintain with cutting boards regularly in the rotation. Around the sink, the couple chose a section of white quartz for easy maintenance and to protect the butcher block from water stains. Standard white subway tile adds a simple gleam and contrast between the cabinet lines.</p>
<p>Being avid cooks, Daniel and Kate really wanted to have appliances that could elevate their culinary skills. Key considerations for a new stove were powerful burner output and controls on the front of the oven; having the control panel on the back stand was too out of the way. Recipe experiments and heavy use mean that a food writer’s oven can get pretty gunky, so extra points for minimal nooks and grooves went to the stove they chose. The sink is an undermount with nice depth for lots of pots and pans, and the faucet is a simple gooseneck model with no side accents that might get in the way of a scrub down.</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="s1" style="color: #76808f;"><i>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Gordon</i></span></p>
<h3>A new start for an old home</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our home, a brick townhouse in the Sunnyside Garden Historic District, was built in 1925 in one of the first planned communities inspired by the <span class="s2">English Garden Movement </span>in the United States. This enclave in the borough of Queens was originally developed to promote green space and community while providing affordable housing to working-class folks. Tracy, a financial analyst, and I, a teacher, had been living in the neighborhood for some time when we purchased the house, a former rental that hadn’t been improved since the early ‘90s. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/">We had a lot of ideas for updating it</a>.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">We felt lucky to find a three-story home of roughly 1,200 square feet, or 400 square feet per floor. The townhouse had three bedrooms and two bathrooms, and that was more than enough for the two of us, our cats, Laurel and Juniper, and our dog, Ballou. We wanted to gut-renovate both baths and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overhaul our underutilized basement</a>. If we could squeeze in maximum function on every level, the house would feel more modern and bigger.</span></p>

<h3>Remodeling a landmarked townhouse</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We had <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/">renovated the kitchen</a> just after buying the house four years ago. The job, a mix of DIY projects and subcontractor commissions, was successful but laborious. We were recovered and ready to tackle the next phase, but understood that <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">the difficulty of the work would exceed our own abilities</a>, as would the red tape. Because we own a landmarked building, we would have to secure not only the expected Department of Buildings paperwork but also obtain Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) permits and approvals on all work impacting the building’s exterior. We knew our general contractor would assume much of this burden, which made us feel more comfortable diving in.</span></p>

<span class="s1">We dreamed of a polished concrete floor but settled for large, matte concrete-effect tiles instead.</span></p>

<h3>Giving new life to the basement</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of the whole renovation, the basement would be the larger piece, the goal was to increase the house’s usable space. Before we started, the basement was a large, unlevel room. Thanks to the old home’s process of settling, there was a two-inch difference in floor height from the walls to the room’s center. It had an outdated bathroom and poorly planned utility areas. A previous owner had installed an awkwardly placed cabinet and sink in the middle of the big room, and the washer and dryer next to the 40-year-old boiler, making laundry day a sweaty affair. The basement bathroom was dark and dank. We wanted to recreate the basement as a study, gaming/movie space, music center, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/healing-home-space/">cat sanctuary</a> with storage, laundry, and a hospitable second bathroom.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42868 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2.jpg" alt="washer and dryer basement" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A Queens basement remodel to be livable</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We started in the downstairs, where we first had to level the floor. We dreamed of a polished concrete floor but settled for large, matte concrete-effect tiles instead. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/">The cost and challenge of doing a poured floor</a> just didn’t make it practical, and we were ultimately happy with an alternative that gave the room a similar feel at a lower cost. After losing two inches of headspace in the leveling of the floor, our Sweeten contractor suggested raising the ceiling by exposing and painting the heating pipe—easy, since they were replacing the room’s drywall, anyway. A new basement door, window, and vents for the bathroom and boiler room were installed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next, they subdivided the space, creating a new living area, a storage room, and an expanded bathroom. LPC approvals, necessary for the new exterior basement door and window, as well as bathroom and laundry venting, went through smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42855 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7.jpg" alt="bathroom image after remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><em>(Above) &#8220;After&#8221; basement bathroom</em></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42851 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3.jpg" alt="concrete bathroom sink" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That leads me to the renovation’s second and equally important part: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/">the bathroom remodels</a>. The basement bath would get a complete gut job to remove a creepy stall shower, and an expansion to make room for a freestanding bathtub. The windowless downstairs bathroom needed to be bright and clean. We went for a spare look, choosing large wall tiles, a custom concrete sink, and a wall-hung toilet, in addition to the beautiful bathtub. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">A tub-turned-shower for the master bath</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our upstairs bath would also be gutted and refreshed, with a glass-walled shower replacing the old tub-and-shower setup. We couldn’t make the</span><span class="s3"> 30-square-foot room bigger, </span><span class="s1">but <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/renovation-tips-bigger-bathroom/">we could up its storage and functionality</a>. Upstairs, we went for a modern toilet and a compact, wall-mount sink, along with a recessed medicine cabinet, and toothbrush niche. We installed rectangular wall tiles vertically for a playful effect. Both baths got recessed lighting.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><em><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42840 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3.jpg" alt="black hexagon bathroom floor tile, clear shower doors" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(Above) &#8220;After&#8221; upstairs bathroom</span></em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it was finally time to finish the basement, we were excited to be able to install the shelving system ourselves; the contractor made it easy by mounting wood blocking between the wall studs. <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/">We wanted built-ins</a>, but the wall-shelving was more cost-effective and looks great. We offset neutral surfaces with books, wood accents, and colorful velvet furnishings. One takeaway we agree on: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/">Don’t cheap out on hardware</a>; the difference shows as it wears.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The only downside, in the end, was that the price of the project came in much more than we anticipated after we had to replace the boiler and a rotted drainpipe. Once we finalized the task list, though, our Sweeten contractor stuck to the budget. Doubling our living space has had such an impact on our daily life. We don’t have a single regret!</span></p>

</ul>
<h3>Bathroom need color</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Owners Rachel and Michael didn’t want to go super modern with their bathroom update, so they went with a classic look that complemented their apartment’s prewar roots. The original space was dark and in an uninspiring neutral, the shower was cramped and confined by uneven walls, and old chipped tile throughout had clearly seen better days.  A remodel was in order. The couple posted their project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose their contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43078 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Creating more space without changing the layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping the existing layout intact, Rachel and Michael made crucial updates, starting with tearing down the unnecessary wall framing of the shower<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>which added an extra nine inches to the height of the shower<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>and swapping the old glass door for a new one. With a bigger and brighter space to fill, a waterfall of penny tile in various shades of blue shines as a showpiece. The open and light-filled shower with its mosaic of tile is now Michael’s favorite part of the bathroom.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43069 size-full" title="Blue and white bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1.jpg" alt="blue bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43072 mb-0 size-full" title="Console sink and medicine cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3.jpg" alt="console sink" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A contrast between colors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A dusky shade of blue paint dominates the upper half of the walls while balancing the crackle-finish white subway tile with the right amount of contrast. White hexagon floor tile adds another layer of pattern. The tub also experienced a major improvement: out went the old tub with a clunky, external drainage system, and in went the new with an integrated system, vintage-style wall-mount tub filler, and a tiled tub surround.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43077" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43076" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Same bathroom, bigger feel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a month of going back and forth on deciding on the replacement, the couple switched out the boxy, builder-grade vanity for an open console design, making the space feel considerably larger. A mirrored medicine cabinet and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">triple-light fixture over the vanity</a>—Rachel’s favorite details—complete the look. The result? A room once bathed in beige gets new energy. [For these homeowners, an open-console vanity was a must.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Dust bunnies averted! Michael noted that his contractor did a spectacular job of keeping the bathroom clean, combating the huge amount of debris generated by the work.</p>

<p><em><span class="s1">Owner Mike Stamatelos felt a space to decompress from the outside world was needed and, as his debut in hospitality, opened Porcelain in the Queens, New York neighborhood of Ridgewood. To help him navigate his Queens café remodel, he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/commercial/39799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a renovation platform matching renovators with vetted contractors, to find his general contractor. He tapped <a href="https://elizabethingram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">designer Elizabeth Ingram</a> to craft the visual story. Objects and materials were culled to represent a designed-through-the-decades feel </span></em><em><span class="s1">that inspired the community space.

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Where did the idea for the business come from?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> The desire to give folks a space to spend time with those they care about and mindfully pass time to think. I wanted to create a setting definitively separated from the outside world that gives people that space to appreciate the sights, sounds, and smells of everyday life. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the opening of this new brick-and-mortar space? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> This was both my first serious entrepreneurial venture and my inaugural introduction into hospitality. That said, the path to opening was marked by trial-and-error, sage advice from friends, and a great deal of uncertainty. Major thanks to Google. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Requirements for most major milestones and the steps to get to them were done through research and calling up people in the industry. The regulatory environment in NYC is necessary but very complex. At the end of it all, though, we opened strong and ready for business. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do your new design and the materials represent your brand? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> The design, led by designer Elizabeth Ingram, is built off of a fictional story inspired by the history of the neighborhood: A century ago, an Austrian immigrant created a space that emulated his hometown cafés using humble means. It was “upgraded” by family through the generations based on what was popular at the time. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The result is a space that looks like it’s been here forever. We were very particular in the materials used to create something humble and honest, which is core to what Porcelain represents.</span></p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth:</strong> <span class="s1">We inherited certain important elements from the movie set left in the space by Martin Scorsese’s film <em>The Irishman</em>. The linoleum floor and the bar, both imbued the space with an early to mid-20th-century feel and we decided to embrace that era, but, instead of an old Irish bar, we felt that, in keeping with the neighborhood, we would look to the rich tradition of Viennese coffee houses with a humble grandiosity. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">We designed a space that seems to have nearly been unchanged for 80 years so that people felt like they had discovered a place that time had forgotten. One that had developed organically throughout decades, not designed last week and installed. The stenciled walls and tattered chandeliers bring a sense of ornamentation that has weathered the years and softened with age. The restroom is a bit more &#8217;70s funky, as though the third generation of the original owners had done some modernizing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have a great source for antiques and decorative items in Atlanta, so many of the light fixtures, hand-blown glass cake stands, and upholstered furniture were purchased in the area and trucked up. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do you think Sweeten can help entrepreneurial business owners like yourself?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> Navigating the construction process is a complete maze and working directly with a good contractor is helpful. There is a level of overall consultation that is needed for inaugural brick-and-mortar store creators, such as help defining and providing templates for the various stages of a project.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Can you describe the “before” space? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> The space was originally built in the first decade of the 20th century, with 12’ high original tin ceilings. The Boy Scouts met in it for decades, and it was most recently used as the film set for Martin Scorcese’s movie T<em>he Irishman.</em> The bar, flooring, and doors built for the movie were used in our final design. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What’s next for the brand?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> Aside from introducing a number of wonderful brunch and breakfast to-go items, we’re excited to start holding performances at the space during brunch on weekends!</span></p>

</ul>
<h3>A new kitchen layout</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Gina and Andrew, who met while working on the Broadway production of <em>Billy Elliot</em>, purchased a pre-war two-bedroom apartment in Sunnyside, Queens, the year they married. The kitchen did not inspire them to cook <i>at all</i>, with its drab stock cabinets and awkward layout, completely sectioned off from the living area. After 2.5 years of ownership, they decided they were ready to tackle the renovation. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42274 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-14.jpg" alt="Renovators' family portrait" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-14.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Inspired to cook</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">What was a dim and cramped space is now an oasis. Andrew says, “I never used to cook and after our renovation, I’m cooking up a storm!” The homeowners worked with their </span><span class="s4">Sweeten general contractor</span><span class="s2"> to bring the color from their co-op courtyard into the home. They wanted to extend the natural green and chose a beautiful agave for the lower cabinets, while going with white for uppers to better reflect the light.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Warm brass hardware pops against the cooler tones of the cabinetry and white sink. A new stacked washer and dryer replaced the refrigerator, which relocated to a space closer to the kitchen window. Opposite the new fridge, a floor-to-ceiling <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-cabinets-in-motion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry with pull-out drawers</a> provides plenty of space for dry goods storage. </span></p>

<h3>Living at home during a renovation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">As first-time renovators, Gina and Andrew learned a lot during the experience. They report that their biggest challenge was <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living at home during the renovation</a>, with their dog, Brewster. However, Andrew also found it useful to be on-site during the renovation since he was able to check in regularly with the contractor and was able to follow along on the progress. While the removal of a load-bearing wall required architectural drawings to be submitted for approval, it was well worth it to have a kitchen more connected to the living and dining spaces. They also gained a breakfast bar by opening up a pass-through. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42271 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="kitchen, brushed gold faucet" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-11.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-11-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-11-585x878.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-11-1170x1755.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s5"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span class="s6">: Fifty feet of unusable hallway space was repurposed into a dining area thanks to borrowing square footage from an adjacent second bedroom. Pocket doors were installed so that the interior space could remain “open and light could flow into the dining room.” They doubled their entertaining space by doing this! </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>If you want to have your way with a New York City apartment, “handyman special” is the phrase to look for in the listings. And that’s exactly what our discreet homeowners—we’ll call them MR and SV—found when they walked into this one-bedroom Kew Gardens, Queens co-op. The 1,000-square-foot unit was chock full of prewar features, but would make way for a clean and modern look focusing on the kitchen and bathroom.

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My wife, SV, and I purchased a co-op in a nice prewar building, where it looked like nothing had changed since the doors opened in 1939. Having renovated our previous Brooklyn co-op, we had some experience. We had no intention of turning this vintage one-bedroom into a jet-age European fantasy apartment that would look laughable in less than a year. Still, every inch of the interior, with the exception of the windows, which are the property of the co-op itself, needed work. We had a draftsman and architect draw up plans. </span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Meanwhile, our Sweeten bids came in; we interviewed four contractors and agreed on one. </span><span class="s1">We’d written in our project profile that we were looking for complete renovations of both the kitchen and bathroom. We’d stated upfront that we intended to source all of the appliances, cabinets, fixtures, and flooring ourselves. In the interest of full disclosure, I also wrote: “Please be aware that there are both cosmetic and structural alterations involved that will require meeting the co-op building&#8217;s management requirements and any DOB requirements.” I prefer to head off surprises whenever possible. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We began by gutting the kitchen. In addition to the cabinets and appliances, we removed the 1930s-era architectural elements including an arch and ripped out the dated kitchen door and its frame. The floor was covered in linoleum tiles. Out! Our contractor put down new </span><span class="s3">ceramic floor tiles</span><span class="s1"> and white </span><span class="s3">subway tiles</span><span class="s1"> as a backsplash for our gray-grained cabinets. The six-burner gas range was a splurge, but we did everything else clean and spare. </span><span class="s4">With proper electrical updating, we even managed a dishwasher in the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s2">We gutted the bathroom next, in the end deciding to refinish the bathtub rather than replace it with the stand-up shower we’d planned. </span><span class="s1">SV decided on wall tiles with a beveled edge and a wispy smoke pattern. For the floor, crosshatch floor tiles were laid down in a chevron design. With input from our contractor, a glass-paneled barn-style door mounted on a track was installed which saves space in the bathroom and hallway.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our contractor stripped and stained all of the original parquet wood floors in the living areas. </span><span class="s1">We also installed smoke and carbon monoxide detectors throughout.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During every new phase, our upstanding Sweeten contractor looked at our plans, went over the steps necessary, and helped me answer questions from the building management company’s construction engineer. </span><span class="s1">SV and I grilled our contractor before we began, so we knew what we were getting into. He gave us a contract including a price and an exhaustive list of the work he’d be responsible for. He stood by the price and the work, re-negotiating our agreement only as changes came up. Whenever I had questions, I was able to contact him or his office manager. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We purchased most of the materials and ran each item by our contractor, I got a thumb’s up or an explanation for why something wouldn&#8217;t work. </span><span class="s1">I made it my business to be at the job site daily. I knew enough to stay out of the way of the workers and, if necessary, to sweep up or run out to get coffee for the crew.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We suffered a few stops and starts, primarily due to disagreements with the co-op’s management over construction elements. </span><span class="s1">Did everything come out according to plan? Look at the photos and you decide. I’d write more, but SV wants me to install a wall-mounted broom rack. We’re getting a little closer to finished every day. And we love this old place. Especially now that it’s brand new.</span></p>

<h3>From Manhattan to a tighter-knit neighborhood</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A series of events, including a new job, took Anita from Manhattan’s Chelsea to a co-op in Jackson Heights. “I wanted to live somewhere where I felt part of a community and that my connections could really make a difference. I also left the private sector for the nonprofit world,” she shared. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57122 size-full" title="Sweeten renovator portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowner" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her new 850-square-foot apartment in a 1950s building was the right fit for her reimagined life—minus the kitchen. “I knew I’d gut renovate the kitchen the second I saw it,” Anita said. She’d been living simply (with just a bed and kitchen table) in the apartment for three months when she embarked on her first renovation. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he project was posted to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sweeten and was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a selection of vetted <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/queens-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Queens</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h3>A white and wood kitchen for gathering</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anita’s mission for the bland and dated space? To create a warm and modern room with plenty of storage and room to host friends. There were no outlets along the entire counter wall either, so updating the electrical panel was essential.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anita used Ikea’s kitchen planning tool, working with an Ikea designer to measure the kitchen and select all of the materials she needed to order. Pairing a simple contrast of colors, this combination offered an interesting spin on traditional design for added visual appeal. The dual finishes even carried over into the drawer-within-drawer system for a coordinated look. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her years spent living in Germany (where she says everyone renovates kitchens, even in rentals) inspired the appliance choices, as did prior work experience. “I had also worked in refrigeration for vaccines in developing countries and know way too much about refrigerators,” Anita said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking out kitchen floor tile proved to be a more difficult decision. Her contractor recommended a supplier in Queens where, after several trips, she found a cement-look tile made in Italy.</span></p>

<h3>The right contractor is in sync with their client</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a first-time renovator, Anita worried most about timing, budget, and working with a professional she could trust. Her Sweeten contractor delivered on all three, offering a reasonable estimate based on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen remodeling costs</a>, a clear timeline from the get-go, and following through during the project. </span></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M46pF7SpsME" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My contractor sent me to reputable places priced within my budget that had items in stock. So, I didn&#8217;t have to rely on catalog pictures or internet images. He also respected my budget but knew when to push me toward better quality items or when simpler materials would suffice,&#8221; she said. &#8220;One of his best traits was being really good at reading people. He knew when my freaking out was legitimate and when I was falling into a trap of keeping up with the next big trend.&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contractor’s team was also respectful of the building, taking the right precautions and cleaning up every day. Anita said her building super still compliments them on their professionalism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, she has a brand new kitchen, where she can throw “kitchen parties,” sip wine, and just enjoy the space.</span></p>

<h3>A home search is serendipitous</h3>
<p>We were living in a one-bedroom apartment on the third floor for almost a year when an opportunity came knocking. Tina’s father, who used to be the superintendent in the building, heard about this apartment through the grapevine. The two-bedroom, one-bath with an eat-in kitchen on the ground floor had been occupied by the same owner for decades. The apartment hadn’t yet been listed, so we didn’t know what to expect. As we eagerly walked in, it became clear that it needed a lot of TLC.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41734 size-full" title="portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-21.jpg" alt="home remodel" width="1856" height="2784" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-21.jpg 1856w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-21-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-21-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1856px) 100vw, 1856px" /></a></p>
<p>Its dimensions were a little over 900 square feet. We saw plenty of potential, but the original layout was partitioned and closed-off. The dated 1970s finishes and dark saturated colors throughout made the space feel extremely dark and cavernous. It was certainly a fixer-upper, but we agreed it was worth taking on and jumped in feet first.</p>

<h3>A successful general contractor match</h3>
<p>Living in the same building, we could easily visit the space for measurements, planning, and the actual renovation. Enter <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>. After interviewing nearly ten lackluster contractors, we discovered Sweeten and signed up immediately. Their contractors were a godsend, very professional, and responsive. We got an estimate the same day when others would take days or just ghost us completely. And they took the time to answer all our questions and negotiate prices before they were even hired. Choosing a contractor was probably one of the most stressful and time-consuming parts of the renovation process.</p>
<h3>Planning a coastal look</h3>
<p>Our vision was to make the space airy, bright, and modern while still complementing the building’s prewar style. Tina, a designer by trade, used her skills to sketch layouts, create mood boards, and research finishes. French bistros, Vermont farmhouses, and Hampton beach bungalows were inspirations. The apartment was grounded in light neutrals with navy blue and oak wood accents for a coastal look. We loved the clean lines and texture of the shiplap, board and batten, and exposed brick. Touches of brass and Carrara marble helped warm up and elevate the space.</p>

To brighten the space further, we doused every surface with white paint and installed French doors to all the bedrooms. The carpets were removed to reveal the original 1930s hardwood floors. To our relief, the parquet still had plenty of life left in them. We went with a clear matte finish to give it a natural look and feel.</p>
<h3>More natural light in the living room</h3>
<p>The windows in the living room and spare room were recessed nearly a foot into the wall which blocked a lot of light from coming in. Exposing the brick on these walls would open things up. Our contractor built beautiful custom window frames to finish the windows off. We used a natural limestone paint to whitewash the brick for an aged look.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41698 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-13.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-13-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Bounce your wildest ideas off of the professionals; that is what they are there for.</p></blockquote>
<h3>A kitchen opens up—partially</h3>
<p>We took the plunge and opened up half the kitchen into what would become the living room—the brightest space in the apartment. It also gave back a nice chunk of square footage previously wasted with an awkwardly-curved wall. A small linen closet was removed to fit a large countertop between the kitchen and living room.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQtbfhBsVrk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>As a family that loves to entertain and cook together, we wanted a functional space with a lot of storage. Because kitchens take up a large portion of a renovation budget, we tried to be clever and save where we could. Instead of custom cabinets, we went with Ikea but purchased the cabinet doors from a company that specializes in stylish and modern cabinetry for Ikea kitchen systems.</p>

Marble tiles are more affordable than a marble slab (and a lot less maintenance). All of our state-of-the-art appliances were purchased at an outlet in Long Island where appliances were like-new floor samples. If you have the time and patience to hunt for deals, it can really save you a lot in the long run. We did splurge on the “jewelry” of the kitchen—the faucet and cabinet hardware.

<h3>Details make a difference</h3>
<p>The bedroom with two large closets became the master bedroom. Two closets were combined into one big walk-in closet. We painted the room white and added board and batten paneling on one wall for dimension. The double french doors our contractor installed (also in the spare room) were our favorite part of the room. It gave the space a grand look and let so much natural light come through.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41691 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>The bathroom was on the smaller side and didn’t see a need to sacrifice any space to expand it. We included some fun touches, like a brass light fixture (plus dimmer switch) and a vintage-style exposed shower body. The extra-wide medicine cabinet and custom-built vanity helped make efficient use of limited storage.</p>

<h3>Experiencing the renovation process</h3>
<p>Our contractor and his team deserve a lot of credit for their hard work and patience with us. Everybody should know that these jobs are never simple. Scheduling can get tricky.</p>
<p>Being detail-oriented and working with a contractor you can communicate with were really important to us. Our Sweeten contractor had no problem emailing back and forth about even the smallest detail. Bounce your wildest ideas off of the professionals; that is what they are there for.</p>
<p>One thing we would caution is the amount of work, if any, you decide to take on yourself. To keep the budget under control we decided to paint and do some other finishes ourselves. We saved thousands of dollars but doing all that work when we both have full-time jobs was exhausting.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41706 size-full" title="dresser" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-17.jpg" alt="dresser" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-17-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-17-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Our new home really feels like a dream come true, and we feel very fortunate to call it our own. It was no cakewalk, but we had a blast every step of the way. Coming after work and seeing the progress made was so exciting. The hope and promise of creating a space all your own, to us, is what renovations are all about. We hope our fellow renovators find it as <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rewarding of an experience</a> as we did.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Tina and Andrew, for sharing how your new home came together!</em></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: After years of living with roommates, the renters saved up to buy a place of their own: a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in Flushing, Queens. As new homeowners who finally had the option to make their mark on a space, they decided to renovate the kitchen. It was cramped and inefficient for cooking, with unusable corner cabinets and appliances that were too close together. The couple hired an architect, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/troupesong/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jumi Song</a>, who sketched out a few ideas based on their planned use of the space. “They also had a Pinterest page of design items they liked, and I used that as a reference for how to select finishes—they wanted a modern feel with a muted palette,” Jumi shared. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/36917" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> to Sweeten on behalf of her clients and was matched with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5310#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor</a> to bring the plans to life. </span></p>

To gain more space and give more separation between the master bedroom and kitchen, the contractor built a two-foot extension wall. The stove and sink stayed in their original location, but the refrigerator and dishwasher moved to an adjacent wall, directly across from the island, to establish a more efficient flow.</span></p>

<p>Nellie, who works in television, and Lauren, a designer, had a nagging thought every time they paid their rent: their hard-earned money could go toward their mortgage rather than paying for someone else’s.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-19.jpg" alt="couple portrait" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-41403 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-19-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-19-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With the looming closure and repair of their main transport artery, the L subway line in Brooklyn, they finally took the plunge and bought an apartment. The 700-square-foot, one-bedroom co-op was built in Jackson Heights, Queens, in 1936. “It’s a peaceful vibrant neighborhood that we’ve come to really enjoy,” Nellie said. (As fate would have it, a job relocation brought the couple to Minnesota following the purchase and renovation, so they maintain their Jackson Heights pad as a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pied-à-terre in NYC</a>.)</p>

<p>The apartment’s initial appearance was bland and uninspired, calling for <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opening up the kitchen</a>, giving the living room more flow, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updating the bathroom</a>. A fire a few years earlier had destroyed much of the original prewar detail, which took the pain out of the couple’s decision to modernize the space. “Our style, in general, is modern, so we like clean lines and black accents,” Nellie said.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evaluating the whole apartment</a>, it also felt too compartmentalized; opening it up would make a smaller home feel big and airy. To execute their remodel, they posted their project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/queens-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor in Queens</a> to create their vision.</p>

The contractor <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began the work in the kitchen</a> opened it up to the living room and added cabinetry that went to the ceiling and wrapped around the new, wider opening. “This afforded us extra storage space,” Nellie said. “We even fit a dishwasher, which we never had in previous apartments, so that was exciting.” The space was also outfitted with semi-custom Italian cabinets and a hidden pullout trash can (a big plus for Lauren and Nellie).</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-04.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-41388 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>In the bedroom, the first port of call was the closet—there wasn’t any storage in the room. Nellie and Lauren picked out something large, but simple from Ikea. Their general contractor installed it but needed to shift the entrance to the bedroom to accommodate it.  “It was our contractor’s idea to add some molding at the bottom and frame it on the sides to make it look built-in,” Nellie said. Custom knobs also elevated the wardrobe’s appearance.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41396 mb-0 size-full" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-12.jpg" alt="bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>

At the time of the renovation, the couple had three cats. “We turned the bottom of a hallway closet into their food and water area and a little hideout,” Lauren said. There was also a specialized spot to hide the litter box.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning the bathroom</a>, Nellie and Lauren originally dreamt of a walk-in shower. Instead, they opted for a sunken tub with a hinged glass door. Although the couple’s aesthetic was modern, they gave a nod to the apartment&#8217;s prewar roots by installing classic subway tiles on the walls and black hexagon floor tiles.</p>
<p>Their contractor discovered that much of the shower wall could be pushed back four inches. Where the wall couldn’t be pushed back, he added a handy ledge right next to the shower with a niche shelf to store items. Previously, the bathroom door had swung in. Nellie and Lauren envisioned a pocket door to reclaim some of that space. However, wiring in the walls made this impossible. Instead, they opted for a barn door (they also added a barn door for the bedroom near the apartment entrance).</p>

<p>The couple decided not to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live in the apartment during the renovation</a>. “We had heard that living in a space during a reno can be stressful,” Nellie said. “and we knew we wanted to renovate, so we extended our rental lease.” They did move in with an incomplete kitchen. “We set up a makeshift kitchen with a folding table and just ate takeout and food from an air fryer for maybe three months,” Nellie said. &#8220;We did dishes in the bathroom sink.&#8221;</p>

The entire apartment was painted white for a bright backdrop. Voice-activated ceiling fans—“I’m kind of a tech junkie,” Nellie said—have proven perfect for both summer and winter. To further open up the apartment, the duo removed a wall that separated the foyer from the living space to allow natural light to flow into that area. Initially, they didn’t know what to do with the space and eventually turned it into a small seating area. “I think where we’ve landed now makes sense, but it took some time to get there,” Nellie said.</p>

<p>Lauren and Nellie loved the whole renovation process, although decision fatigue did set in towards the end. “You don’t realize how many decisions there are to be made,” Nellie said. One bit of advice the couple has for other first renovators is to be prepared for your project to take longer than planned.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working with their Sweeten contractor</a>, Lauren and Nellie are “thrilled” with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final results of their new home</a>. They see their new-look apartment as an embodiment of who they are as people. “It’s quirky and fun and colorful and modern—all of our favorite things,” Nellie said.</p>

<h3>A style fix</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roxana and Gabriel’s Long Island City, Queens, loft boasts 15-foot ceilings and loads of natural light. The apartment’s kitchen, however, didn’t suit the couple’s Scandinavian, minimalist style. It lacked counter space, the sink was smaller than standard, and the to-be renovators just weren’t vibing with the finishes. They wanted integrated appliances with all clean lines and everything stowed away in cabinets or drawers. The rest of their home has walnut and matte finishes throughout, so they knew they wanted a similar aesthetic in the cooking space, too. The couple, a creative director and software engineer, who also has a three-year-old son, </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/36746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sweeten and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41454 size-full" title="oak-and-white-kitchen-cabinets-combination" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-04-1.jpg" alt="maple kitchen cabinets and white countertop and gas cooking range with oven and white overhead cabinets and open to dining after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-04-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-04-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-04-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h3>New cabinetry</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed with a clear perspective, the couple got to work with their contractor to reimagine their kitchen. Gabriel used the Ikea kitchen planner tool to lay out the space, exploring its customization offerings to suit their needs. The cabinetry is all Ikea but modified to cover the appliances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wall cabinet containing the range hood is shorter and wider than the surrounding units but is still covered by the same door size. The refrigerator, which moved from the main kitchen area into what was formerly a coat closet proved to be one of the biggest challenges. They had to find the right size to not only fit into the existing space, but also align with Ikea panels. “The fridge hunt was probably the single largest use of our time. Ask my wife about chasing our son through AJ Madison,” Gabriel said. Their contractor ended up cutting a 36 inch Ikea panel into three pieces to integrate the refrigerator with the walnut cabinets. They also fit in a cabinet right next to it. All of the drawers and wall cabinets are equipped with LED lighting, adding to the custom feel.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Patience from their general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sleek aesthetic carried throughout their material choices, from the matte black faucet, lack of cabinet hardware, and a single slab counter and backsplash without any seams. “Our contractor was very patient with all my crazy ideas and helped me make them actually work,” Roxana said. “He helped brainstorm a lot of the Ikea ‘hacking’ and was very patient with us,” she continued.</span></p>

<h3>A modern finish</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten Client Services helped from the get-go to find a general contractor who would be on board for such a custom project, setting the stage for a successful renovation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for their new kitchen? “It feels modern, calm, and welcoming. It fits our needs and it feels like home,” the couple shared. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gabriel used an app called Sketch Up to mock up the kitchen and ensure everything would fit with the existing plumbing fixtures. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Rich color and a tweaked façade for a Queens house</h2>
<p><em>Gary, a scientist, and his husband lived in their humble home in the New York City borough of Queens for ten years before they found the nerve to move on their exterior renovation. “We always knew we wanted to do it but we were intimidated,” he says. “We didn’t know where to start.” The partners summoned the strength to tackle the much-needed work, then <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/29899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors. Soon, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4112#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the contractors they chose</a> had a plan to transform the not-so-pretty home to one with serious curb appeal.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gary-Hunnicutt-Home-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41289 size-full" title="exterior-of-two-storey-house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gary-Hunnicutt-Home-05.jpg" alt="exterior of small two storey house with light green vinyl sliding and landscaped front yard after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gary-Hunnicutt-Home-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gary-Hunnicutt-Home-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gary-Hunnicutt-Home-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>The truth is, when I called Sweeten and their Client Services said, “It sounds like you need a GC,” I didn’t even know what that was. This is our first home, purchased a decade ago. Over the years, we’d done what we could on our own, but we knew it needed more TLC than we could manage. We had hired handy people for patches. We’d had poor experiences, and those incidents made us gun-shy. We knew the house needed serious renovation work, but we had no idea how it would be done or what the cost might be. We were terrified.</p>

It’s only 16 feet wide and 36 feet long, with postage-stamp front- and backyards. One of our friends, when visiting for the first time, christened it, “The Tardis.” It reminded him of the time machine on that old British sci-fi show Dr. Who, because it looks bigger on the inside than it does from the street. The house has a basement; a first floor with a living room, dining room, and kitchen; a second floor with three bedrooms and a bathroom; and an unfinished attic. The square footage is about 1,600 with a finished basement or 1,100 square feet without. Built in the 1920s, the house was of a popular style—there are thousands like it in Queens.</p>
<p>We have a 1939 tax photo of the place, given to us as a housewarming gift, and since we received it, we’d wanted to revise the exterior to resemble the original. We’d driven around and looked at a lot of houses in the neighborhood, noting styles and features that we felt worked nicely, and those we knew did not. The homes around us have great potential, but many lost their souls during the vinyl-siding cataclysm of the 1970s and ‘80s.</p>

It also had “yankee” gutters—U-shaped troughs built right into the roof—that would spill over and direct water down the sides of the house. So the first phase of the project was to replace the bad roofing with new shingles and install hanging gutters, which we hoped would resolve the leaking issues. We chose black shingles and black gutters to match, and the job was a relative snap that made a huge difference inside and out.</p>

<p>Next up was to remove the old vinyl siding. We would upgrade the windows and place insulation in the walls, since the house had previously had none, before installing new siding. The front of the house had a bow window that was oddly tall, and did not jive with the eyeline of the door, giving the house a disjointed look. We had it removed and replaced with a window that is a better fit and gives the facade cleaner lines.</p>

We’d read about a technique of using more than one color to visually augment a home’s gables, so we decided on three-toned siding and used an online visualization tool to try out combinations of bold, saturated colors. Once we’d agreed on a palette, we got paint samples and tested the colors on large, flat surfaces. We finally choose our barn brown reds, along with a sage green.</p>
<p>Having committed to our colors, we needed to decide on the style and surface texture of our siding.  We wanted a wood look and had heard we could get that with cement-fiber siding; we appreciated the product’s appearance and durability, and also that we could paint over it if we didn’t like our long-debated hues. We decided to add dimension and offset the house’s gables with shakes, a sort of shingle that is thicker and split, not sawn, in the brown-red color.</p>
<p>Figuring out a trim color was next. With the black shingles, gutters and windows, we were afraid more black would be too heavy. We decided to stick with it for the main lines of the house but went with gray trim around the windows and doors. The storm door is black but our front door is a rich burgundy that pops and says, “Welcome.” In honor of our house’s Tardis-like qualities, we painted the back door in Police Box Blue.</p>

Our Sweeten contractor, who has been doing these jobs a long time, was great. We picked his brain and expertise and took many of his suggestions with no regrets. He was accessible, coming by multiple times a week to check on the progress. We never needed backup, but we liked knowing that Sweeten’s Client Services team was there. There were times when our vision failed us, but our contractor gave us good advice: If you aren’t happy with something, stop and have it done right. It was a challenge to believe that the mess would eventually yield success. But it did.</p>
<p>A few neighbors have been open in expressing their dislike of our home’s new look, but they are a minority. We focus on the many people who’ve gone out of their way to say they love it. One neighbor, who is friends with the director of Project Runway, told us that when the friend visited, he said our house was “amazing.” That really tickled us and made me sure that what we did, we did just right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>For its 100th birthday, two sisters give their family home a top-to-bottom refresh</h2>
<p><em>In some ways, nothing has changed at the Jamaica, New York house that sisters Gayle, Merri, and their family have called home for 50 years. But while the bones of the home, like the family that lived there, have remained the same, most of what meets the eye has changed. Calling on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, Gayle, a freelance brand strategist, and Merri, a corporate accountant, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hired a general contractor</a> to bring all 1,200 square feet of the two-story, traditional-style house up to date. And they did it just in time to commemorate its 100th birthday.</em></p>

<p>Ripping out the dark brown paneling and the shag carpeting of our family’s detached home in Jamaica, a working-class neighborhood in Queens, New York, couldn’t have come soon enough. Our parents bought the home in 1970 and our family has lived in it continuously since then. I’ve been living in the home since 2012, Merri moved in in 2014, and we purchased the house from our mom, who had downsized to an apartment by then, in 2017.</p>

The space was functional, but it was a little worn, outdated, dark, and drafty.</p>
<p>Our main goals for the reno were to dispel the darkness throughout the house and to bring out the home’s original character, which had really been buried. On a purely functional level, we also wanted to make the house more comfortable by upgrading the interior insulation and making sure the electrical and plumbing were up to snuff.</p>
<p>The flooring throughout the house was another element that helped tie everything together. After peeling back the old carpeting, we discovered that all of the original hardwood floors were in great shape for a house built in the 1920s, so we ended up just sanding and staining them dark walnut. Not having to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pay for new flooring</a> saved us a ton of money. We then installed walnut wood-look porcelain tile in the kitchen and bathroom to keep the look cohesive.</p>

<blockquote><p>[we found] a stained glass window behind paneling in the dining room. I wanted to keep it, so the contractor protected it and framed it out without missing a beat.</p></blockquote>
<p>Between Merri and I, there must be dozens of books in the house. Part what we wanted in making over the house was one central place to keep them. I’ve always loved houses with libraries, so we designated one long wall in the dining room for the library, and bought a six-tier bookshelf to hold everything.</p>
<p>The dining room is located right off of the living room and off of that is an enclosed porch, which we turned into a mudroom. To section off the two spaces, we asked for a glass door, but there was a miscommunication with the contractor and an exterior door was installed instead. What we really wanted was a French door with multiple panes of glass from top to bottom. Our contractor quickly swapped it out for exactly what we wanted, but it was a lesson on how to be specific with requests!</p>

<p>But before we got to decorating, there was some renovating to be done. Our biggest challenge was getting the kitchen exactly right. We moved a corner sink to a new spot under the large window overlooking the backyard. We didn’t want to knock down walls or change the footprint of the kitchen, but we needed more storage. So we got cabinets that go all the way up to the ceiling and added a pantry, which had never been in the house before. We also added a ginormous refrigerator, a dishwasher, and we swapped out the microwave over the range for a freestanding hood. The sizes and layout of the upper and lower cabinets had to be precise to accommodate all of these additions without making the room look overstuffed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40780 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40781 mb-0 size-full" title="hallway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08.jpg" alt="hallway" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>For the bathroom walls, we found 12” x 24” rectangular blocks of gray fabric-look tile. It’s very understated but luxe and looks like suit fabric. We stayed in a hotel that used this kind of tile and managed to track down a lookalike. Everyone thinks it’s wallpaper until they touch it.</p>
<p>As first-time renovators, this was actually one of the biggest lessons we learned: Write your requests down! First, it helps you and whoever you may be renovating with (in this case, my sister) get on the same page. Merri and I have very different tastes and writing down what we wanted forced us to find common ground. The first day we met with our Sweeten contractor matches, we had a list ready for them to react to and this saved so much time. We were able to find out exactly how far our budget would stretch. The list also allowed our contractor to help us prioritize needs and wants. We kept revisiting it throughout the renovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40783 mb-0 size-full" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10.jpg" alt="bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Prior to this, I personally hadn’t done more than paint a wall and put up shelves in my apartment, so the thought of a top to bottom house renovation was mildly terrifying. We were most worried about what was lurking behind the walls—the condition of the electrical and the plumbing. The house is almost 100 years old, so you’re never sure what you’re going to find.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw7gQyvamVQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="reno-video-image"  class="alignnone wp-image-40893 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim.jpg" alt="image of behind the reno video" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<p>We did discover that two support beams were missing under the front entryway floor, which was why it sloped so bad. When our contractor called to tell me, he already had a solution to suggest and pricing ready, so we were able to easily make the correction without impacting the timeline. A good surprise, though, was finding a stained glass window behind paneling in the dining room that was removed. I wanted to keep it, so the contractor protected it and framed it out without missing a beat.</p>

<p>I never felt like I was out of the loop on what was going on with our contractor and his team. Even when our mom became ill one month into construction, we didn’t have a lot of time to talk to him or meet with him, but our back and forth communication had been so great before that he was able to just keep going, handling all of the small decisions and only calling if there was a major decision that needed our input. It was a relief that the work didn’t stop.</p>
<p>Our Sweeten Client Services contacts were also great with checking in weekly to see if everything was proceeding as planned. Three months after we started, the renovation was completed. My favorite part was experiencing how the atmosphere of the rooms transformed; I’d grown up here and everything was very clear in my mind, just the way my parents had it. The renovation actually made it feel like a completely new house. Now, it feels like a calm sanctuary. I just love how relaxed I instantly feel when I walk through the front door.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally, a writer, editor, and digital media executive, and Ross, a certified financial planner, bought their two-bedroom apartment in Jackson Heights, Queens in a 1946 Art Deco building. Sally had already been through three renovations in other homes. She typically looked for <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spaces in fixer-upper condition</a> (and at an “unrenovated” price) versus buying a recently remodeled home that was not her style. ”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know that I can invest in my renovation, get the look and functionality that I want, build equity in my home—and be satisfied with the aesthetic because it’s my design,” she shared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="ikea cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-40344 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>An inconvenient kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1,100-square-foot home was definitely in need of a renovation. Luckily, it had good bones: hardwood floors, thick plaster walls, and high-coved ceilings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They decided to wait to renovate and see if they should keep the existing galley footprint. It became clear that as a two-cook household, Sally and Ross needed more open space, as they could never fit in the kitchen simultaneously. When the dishwasher was open, it blocked the fridge. Plus, the storage situation wasn’t working. Case in point? To find small appliances in the lower cabinets, Sally had to get on her hands and knees with a flashlight, pulling everything out and back in again.</span></p>
<h3>High marks for contractor communication</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After five years of <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">envisioning the kitchen transformation</a>, Sally </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted her project</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sweeten, received <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/queens-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matches to Queens contracting firms</a>, and interviewed candidates. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor she chose</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “stood out as the best communicator” and really understood the aesthetic she was looking to achieve. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was able to explain differences in his proposal and showed where his bid foresaw issues the others hadn’t. These were things that were going to come up, and we were going to have to pay for; he was just calling them out ahead of time. I appreciated that,” Sally shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-40350 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen plans took shape</a>, she had two design plans: one with the kitchen totally open to the living area, and, Plan B, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/decisions-galley-kitchen-renovation-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley style with a partial wall</a>. During a walkthrough with her contractor and building manager, they discovered water supply, disposal, and gas lines that couldn’t be moved without disrupting service to the building. That meant Plan B, which (spoiler alert!) Sally ended up loving. </span></p>
<h3>The vision without the price tag</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally wanted all-paneled and integrated appliances that felt more like furniture. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">found myself gravitating toward kitchens that banked all the tall pantries with the fridges to one side, like Poggenpohl. Henrybuilt has a sleekness I coveted, with its signature absence of wall cabinets and a ubiquitous shelf running along the tops of the slab stone backsplashes. I fell in love with the shaker cabinetry of Plain English, their wonderfully functional sink islands, and use of slab marble,” she said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40343" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="white kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-44860 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If I’d had any challenges with my contractor, which I didn’t, I knew [Sweeten was] there to advise and help me out.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marble backsplash, which Sally referred to as “the star of the show,” consists of two consecutive slabs. A fabricator book-matched them to create the dramatic arc just above the center of the cooktop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen design on budget</a>, they designed the kitchen using the IKEA planner tool and sent a PDF of the design to a cabinet manufacturer who outfitted the IKEA cabinet boxes with all custom doors. Opting for stock bases saved the couple $25,000.</span></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="brass and marble kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-45246 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overall flow improved greatly, thanks to the separate wall ovens and cooktop. Plus, with the refrigerator outside of the main cooking area, it’s easy for guests to grab drinks. The refrigerator is also flanked by tall pantries and cabinets that hold cleaning supplies. Similarly, a narrow unit stores brooms and mops, and all of the base cabinets have deep drawers with organizers. There’s also a unit of freezer drawers, ideal for Sally who batch cooks on the weekends.</span></p>
<h3>Researching contractors with Sweeten</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally had a strong perspective and sense of what she wanted for her kitchen renovation, and she found a contractor who brought her vision to life. “The number one thing I did right was to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire the right contractor</a>,” she said. Before she chose her contractor, <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> shared advice with her on how to compare contractors, which she used to great effect. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the job, they reached out several times to see how it was going. If I’d had any challenges with my contractor, which I didn’t, I knew they were there to advise and help me out.”</span></p>

<h3>Tips from a veteran renovator</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, a four-time renovator, Sally has a lot of advice to share with fellow renovators. “Y</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ou’re going to be making so many choices it will make your head spin. Resist the urge to choose the trendiest or fanciest option at every single decision point. You want one thing, like a marble backsplash, to stand out as the focal point, then maybe a few smaller things, like brass cabinet hardware that picks up the brass in the faucets or in the light fixtures. Let the rest of your choices be the plain backdrop that lets these few gems shine,” she said.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40349" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="broom closet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All-in-all, the renovation finished without a hitch. Sally and Ross love their kitchen. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is extremely gratifying to have a design in your head and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see it become a reality</a>. This kitchen is everything that I dreamed it could be. Ross and I cook meals together, clean up together, and everything we need is at our fingertips. And at the reveal party for our floor neighbors, the open kitchen made entertaining so easy and enjoyable.”</span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Sally and Ross, for sharing your renovation with us!</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Written in partnership</em> <span class="s1"><i>with Sweeten homeowner. </i></span><span class="s1"><i>&#8220;After&#8221; photos by Miao Jiaxin for Sweeten.</i></span></p>
<h3>Buy the rental and turn it into a home</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After renting an apartment in Forest Hills, Queens, the homeowner purchased it and officially made it her own. It was a fortuitous find. Years earlier, a move from Chicago to New York left her little time to search apartment listings. She landed in a quiet, yet bustling neighborhood with walkable shops, stores, and restaurants.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/30073-Megan-Kitchen-09.jpg" alt="Galley kitchen with two tone cabinets" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56585" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/30073-Megan-Kitchen-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/30073-Megan-Kitchen-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/30073-Megan-Kitchen-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She saved up for a renovation to replace the dark kitchen cabinets, countertops, and smaller-than-standard appliances. Her Sweeten general contractor helped give the space a facelift without changing the galley floor plan.</span></p>
<h3>Overcoming a hurdle: choosing materials</h3>
<p>Choosing materials for her kitchen galley renovation turned out to be the most difficult during the process. She spent a lot of time researching <span style="font-weight: 400;">countertop materials (and understanding the difference between them) to finding the right appliances that would last.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large pantry cabinet was replaced with two separated cabinets (upper and lower) to extend countertop space. The bar countertop was lowered and the pass-through window was enlarged. Both design ideas would successfully connect the living and kitchen areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She opted for a two-tone cabinet finish that makes the kitchen feel so much more open thanks to the white upper cabinets. “I had a hard time deciding what color cabinets (white or greyish-blue) I wanted, so I went with both! I thought adding in a touch of color on the bottom would be a fun way to add a bit of character,” the homeowner shared. Open shelves above the sink in lieu of upper cabinet also contribute to a more spacious feel.</span></p>

<h3>First-time renovator finds the right renovation team</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her general contractor provided assurance from the beginning, sharing ideas and material options in their initial consultation, and responding quickly to texts and emails throughout. “He made me the most comfortable right off the bat and I felt like I could trust him with my project and home. I would recommend him in a heartbeat,” the homeowner shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a first-time renovator, Sweeten was a vital resource for her in finding the right contractor for the job. “I had no idea where to start. Sweeten made that process so much easier by providing reviews, success stories, matching you with contractors, etc. I don’t know how I would’ve known where to start without them,” the homeowner continued.</span></p>

<h3>Tip: Being flexible with her kitchen galley renovation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowner offers her words of advice: “Things are not always as they appear. Pinterest, Instagram, and blogs inundate you with so many options that you search and search and finally feel like you know exactly what you want. Well, I felt like I had a good idea of what I wanted, but when I saw certain samples in my space I realized that they were not the right fit or was told reasons why a design wouldn’t be functional.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ll-in-all the kitchen came together without a hitch and transformed the feel of the home. “It’s the first thing I see when I walk in the door and every night when I turn on the light I get excited to see it all over again. Having my vision come to life is amazing. I’ve been so excited to show off the space to my family and friends. I’ve been cooking a lot more that’s for sure,” she shared.</span></p>
