<p>Renovating on Long Island? From the South Shore to the North Fork, we have the numbers you’ll need to plan your renovation&#8217;s budget. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> breaks down the costs on four major remodeling cost categories: kitchen, bathroom, basement, and permits.</p>
<p>Although “Long Island” is technically a region that is home to four New York counties, including Kings County (better known as Brooklyn!) and Queens, this cost guide focuses on the portion of the island that is colloquially known as Long Island, which is primarily Nassau and Suffolk counties. This guide does not include the Hamptons, which is a world of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-hamptons-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its own with renovation prices</a> to match.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of typical starting costs that include labor and materials compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-home renovation: Starting at <strong>$100</strong> per square foot (psf) with stock materials; high-end properties start at <strong>$250+</strong> psf</li>
<li>Budget kitchen remodel: <strong>$20,000—$30,000</strong> (under 100 square feet)</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$30,000</strong> (for 200 square feet)</li>
<li>High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$75,000+</strong> (for 200 square feet)</li>
<li>Budget bath remodel: <strong>$15,000—$20,000</strong> (35 to 40 square feet)</li>
<li>Mid-grade bath remodel: <strong>$21,000—$40,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end bath remodel: <strong>$40,000+</strong></li>
<li>Basement remodel: Starting at <strong>$25,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind while it is great to have an idea of your end cost, a contractor will want a detailed conversation and inspection of your home before delivering a more specific estimate.</p>
<h3>What does a Long Island home remodel cost per square foot?</h3>
<p>Long Island’s proximity to New York City and the Hamptons means that the same regional averages apply. However, real estate prices in Long Island are lower than their neighbors on both sides, and this affects renovation costs.</p>
<p>Most full-home Sweeten renovations in villages including Great Neck, New Hyde Park, and Bellport generally start at <strong>$100</strong> psf.<span style="color: #333333;"> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4914#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Aaron</a> estimates that cosmetic facelifts for dry rooms can be <strong>$30</strong>—<strong>$70</strong> psf </span><span style="color: #333333;">for his projects, while </span><span style="color: #333333;">wet rooms (rooms that are connected to a water supply, i.e., bathrooms or kitchens) typically start at <strong>$375</strong> per square feet. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In Sweeten&#8217;s experience, bathrooms in Long Island are typically larger than 5&#8217;x8&#8242; and can measure 8&#8243;x7&#8242; or 9&#8243;x7&#8242;. High-end (full custom, luxury materials) wet room renovations can cost well over <strong>$700</strong> per square foot. This cost range includes everything from architectural design and drawings to fixtures, demolition, expediting, construction—the whole project.</span></p>
<h5>Fewer hurdles in Long Island</h5>
<p>Since most residential renovations in Long Island are for single-family, fully detached houses, the logistics of renovation are more straightforward. Contractors won&#8217;t need to worry about where to park a car or have limits on the permitted construction hours. (Even if there are city ordinances that limit noise, those are much longer than the working hours typically permitted by an NYC co-op.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, apartment buildings, whether condo or co-op, typically require contractors to ensure cleanliness in the hallways. When workers must spend the beginning and end of the workday prepping and cleaning the halls, this can take up precious time! These factors, which don’t impact most Long Island houses, can result in more affordable prices for those renovators.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor Aaron tells us that, since construction was permitted to restart after the shutdown, clients are itching to get back to their renovations. The most common renovations he’s seeing are additions, dormers, kitchens, baths, pool pavers, and decks.</span></p>

<h3>Costs for a Long Island kitchen renovation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Budget kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can cost between <strong>$20,000—$30,000</strong> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot. This typically means making use of engineered flooring, off-the-shelf cabinets, and an economical tile or butcher block for countertops. It also includes swapping out old appliances for energy-efficient models.</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen: Sweeten has seen costs starting at <strong>$30,000</strong>. <em>Remodeling</em>’s Cost vs. Value Report shows that a mid-grade, major kitchen renovation of a 200-square-foot space will run about <strong>$69,910</strong> based on averages for the Middle Atlantic region (as opposed to <strong>$84,484</strong> for New York City). This range covers updating 30 linear feet of semi-custom wood cabinets, an island, new countertops, a double-tub stainless steel sink, energy-efficient range, vented hood, built-in microwave, dishwasher, garbage disposal, and custom lighting. This comes to about <strong>$350</strong> psf.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5543#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Vita</a>, “Kitchens on Long Island typically need a full gut in order to upgrade electrical, plumbing, insulation, and correcting for settling of the foundation.&#8221;</p>
<ul>
<li>High-end kitchen: Expect the budget to start at <strong>$75,000</strong>. The same Cost vs. Value report puts a luxury kitchen renovation around <strong>$137,700</strong> for the region. This will get you top-of-the-line custom cabinets with interior accessories, stone countertops, imported tile backsplash, built-in refrigerator, commercial-grade cooktop and hood, wall oven, built-in microwave, with designer faucets and a water filtration system. This budget also includes custom lighting, including under-cabinet lights, and wood flooring throughout. Broken down to price per square foot, this comes in at <strong>$689</strong> psf.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costs for a Long Island bathroom renovation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Budget bathroom: Sweeten bathrooms can start at <strong>$15,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong> for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes. Sweeten contractor Vita said, “Bathroom remodels often need the same treatment as kitchens, and require a full overhaul of plumbing, electrical supplies, insulation, exhaust ductwork as well as floor and wall straightening. Our base price for a typically-sized, 35-square-foot bathroom renovation starts at <strong>$22,158</strong>, with material and subcontractor allowances.”</li>
<li>Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom remodel for a 35-square-foot area will cost anywhere from <strong>$21,000</strong> to <strong>$40,000</strong>. The Cost vs. Value report provides an average of <strong>$22,158</strong> for the Middle Atlantic region. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, a solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain tub.</li>
<li>High-end bathroom: Sweeten contractors report high-end renovations range starts at <strong>$40,000</strong> and goes up at luxury price points. The same report puts a high-end renovation at <strong>$69,188</strong> for the region. This is based on the expansion of a 35-square-foot bathroom to 100 square feet, within the existing home&#8217;s footprint. A high-end renovation at this price point includes radiant floors, all new ductwork, custom cabinetry, separate shower, and freestanding tub, as well as custom lighting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Costs for a Long Island basement renovation</h3>
<p>Based on Sweeten&#8217;s numbers, the average basement conversion in Long Island comes in at <strong>$117</strong> psf. For a budget, we&#8217;ve seen projects start at <strong>$25,000</strong> and include a bathroom, shower, and laminate flooring. On the high end, a project costing <strong>$75,000</strong> would include a 5’ x 8’ bathroom, shower, a bar area, insulation, and laminate flooring in 20’ x 30’ space.</p>
<p>This is in line with what is reported by Sweeten contractors. For example, Sweeten contractor Vita shares that Long Island basements generally run about <strong>$35,000</strong> for a budget, <strong>$60,000</strong> for a mid-grade renovation, and more than <strong>$60,000</strong> for a high-end project.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the existing condition of the space will impact the budget. Sometimes the floor needs to be dug deeper so the ceiling appears higher, and the walls could require underpinning. Sometimes electricity and plumbing need to be installed, especially if there is no existing bathroom and that’s a crucial part of your plans. Installation and waterproofing can also be a significant cost if needed.</p>
<h3>Costs for permits</h3>
<p>In Long Island, permits are often handled by each town and will likely be tied to the budget you submit. Towns throughout the island all levy different fees. In Suffolk County, for renovations up to <strong>$50,000</strong>, the permit fee is <strong>$250</strong>, and <strong>$500</strong> for renovations up to <strong>$100,000</strong>. For projects above <strong>$250,000</strong>, contractor Aaron estimates the cost is 15%  per <strong>$1,000</strong> for the permit. Plumbing and electrical permits both start at <strong>$50</strong>. For the full list, you can consult this fee schedule.</p>
<p>Hopefully, these facts and figures give you a jumping-off point to begin pulling together a budget. Sweeten’s Renovation Checklist offers you <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a downloadable roadmap to organize</a> all of the moving parts of a renovation including laying out your “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves,” so you can plan and get started off on the right foot.</p>

Based in Westchester, </span></span></span><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4186" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Gregory</span></a> has worked on projects that involve multiple rooms or a gut renovation at the <strong>$250 psf range. </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anything higher, he said, “usually applies to one or more specialty trades, such as architects or engineers, and insurance costs which factors into the overall budget.” Choice of material will also affect the cost per square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Similarly, a higher cost stems from the quality and experience of the skilled workers the contractors hire for the project. “Costs for construction vary based on experience, which increases for a higher-end result,” said a <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor,</span> who handles projects in the Westchester area. For instance, “A presentation representing the finished product—design and organizing, scheduling, and advising on the materials—is a service that adds to the budget.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing to note: While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. Therefore, the prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="s2">Budget kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at </span><span class="s3"><b>$25,000—$30,000</b></span><span class="s2"> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.</span></li>
<li><span class="s2">Mid-grade kitchen: Expect to see starting budgets from </span><span class="s3"><strong>$40,000</strong>—<strong>$50,000</strong></span><span class="s2"> for a typical mid-grade kitchen.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s2">Westchester-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a> has worked on projects costing <b>$40,000</b> for 150 square feet, or about<b> $260 psf</b>. This budget includes mid-grade finishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s2"><i>Remodeling</i>’s<a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span class="s5">Cost vs. Value report</span></a> puts <b>$350 psf</b> or <b>$70,000</b> total, as an average for Westchester County. These figures are based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with standard finishes, like an energy-efficient range, built-in microwave, and ventilation system. It also includes garbage disposal, custom lighting, and resilient floorings such as vinyl, linoleum, or cork.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">High-end kitchen: Sweeten has seen projects start at <strong>$70,000</strong> for a high-end kitchen.<span class="s2"><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><span class="s6">In the Cost vs. Value report, the average high-end kitchen remodel cost <b>more than $137,000</b> for a 200-square foot space. </span><span class="s7">A project in that price range includes custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported tile backsplashes. The appliances can include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood as well as high-end faucets and a water filtration system.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">According to Sweeten contractor Majid, a large part of a high-end kitchen can be attributed to the cabinets. For example, one of Majid&#8217;s clients recently spent <b>$50,000</b> on fully custom European cabinets.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much a Westchester bathroom renovation costs</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="s2">Budget bathroom: A budget bathroom renovation, including demo, plumbing work, and new finishes, can reach </span><span class="s3"><b>$16,000</b></span><span class="s2">, said Oziel. Bathrooms in this category typically lean on big-box stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot to source the majority of materials.<br /></span></li>
<li><span class="s2">Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom in Westchester County will cost on average </span><span class="s3"><b>$22,000</b>,</span><span class="s2"> according to the Cost vs. Value report, which is <b>$628 psf</b> for a 35-square-foot bathroom. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain-on-steel tub.<br /></span></li>
<li><span class="s2">High-end bathroom: Prices can start at around <strong>$32,000</strong> for a standard full bath with high-end finishes. However, homeowners are more likely to splurge for high-end in their master baths, bringing the starting cost for a typical high-end bathroom to around <strong>$46,000.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With a higher budget, clients are looking at faucets that can cost $2,000 apiece, marble flooring, custom vanities, built-in medicine cabinets, a rain shower, and top-of-the-line lighting fixtures. At times, those pricey finishing materials can amount to half the budget. Whether it is budget or high-end, good general contractors can strategize with a reasonable budget to help clients achieve renovation goals.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for a basement renovation in Westchester</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractors have worked on basement renovations that cost anywhere from <b>$20,000 to $75,000. </b>A<b> $20,000—$30,000 </b>or <b>$50/psf </b>budget would update an already finished basement. This includes painting, flooring, and lighting. If the space is raw and being <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovated to a finished living area</a>, the cost is around <b>$75,000</b>. For this budget, a bathroom, a kitchen, and HVAC can be added.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Majid, a simple basement remodel can cost as little as <b>$50 a square foot</b>, which works out to be about <b>$40,000</b> for an 800-square-foot space. Adding a toilet or shower could increase your budget, plus any necessary work to bring the room up to code. Waterproofing and drainage can also push up a basement project’s cost. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some town regulations might require two forms of egress or natural light (by adding a door or a window) or a certain ceiling height, which means digging down and lowering the floor. An average basement conversion in Westchester is <b>$75,000</b>, according to the Cost vs. Value report. A project with this budget includes a 20×30 foot room, a 5&#8217;×8&#8242; bathroom with a shower and bar area, plus insulation and laminate flooring. This example project works out to<b> $117 psf</b>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for permits in Westchester</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cost of permits changes from town to town in Westchester County. Typically, home renovation costs will be determined by your budget, and require some basic math to figure out. For example, the permit costs below are broken out among the different towns across the County:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Pelham</span></span><span class="s1">: Building permits cost <b>$250</b> for a project costing under <b>$5,000</b> plus <b>$12</b> per each additional <b>$1,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Scarsdale</span></span><span class="s1">: Building permits cost<b> $255</b> for a project costing between <b>$10,000</b> and <b>$50,000</b>. For projects budgeted over <b>$100,000</b>, a permit costs a flat fee of <b>$1,755</b> plus <b>$14</b> for each <b>$1,000</b> or fraction over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Katonah</span></span><span class="s1">: Permits cost <b>$14</b> for every <b>$1,000</b> of a budgeted project.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Hastings-on-Hudson</span></span><span class="s1">: The fee will cost <b>$17</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of the estimated construction cost.<br /></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="black-sink-vanity-with-legs"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48761 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="Black sink vanity with legs on white sink in a white and black bathroom after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Refresh a guest bathroom </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nearly 25 years ago, the homeowners were on the hunt for a three-bedroom rental with more space for their two children—who’d long been sharing a bedroom. They stumbled upon a Chelsea apartment, converted from a factory space, that was actually for sale. They agreed to go through with buying their first place—where they’ve lived ever since. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the couple had their kitchen renovated, but left every other room intact—until they decided to remodel the guest bathroom. “It was embarrassingly retro. The faucets didn’t work, there was a gap behind the sink. It just looked old,” they shared. Another priority? To convert the bathtub into a walk-in shower. “My dad, who is in his 90s, stays with us a lot, too,” one of the homeowners shared, so that update was especially important to give him easier access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/admin/projects/32293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project to Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4845#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who would provide design and build help to modernize the space. Guidance picking out and sourcing materials was the main factor in their decision. “Other contractors facilitate the project, file the permits, demolish, install, etc—but then I would’ve had to go find the sink, the toilet, the faucet. This contractor offered to help us find all of our materials, it was part of their service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img decoding="async" title="beige-bathroom-wall-tiles"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48774 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Beige bathroom wall tiles with white pedestal sink along with white bathtub and toilet before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><strong>After</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Before work could begin, the building’s co-op board engineer presented a list of possible requirements, from waterproofing to disability access.  The contractor had to apply for a lot of permits, and at one point in the process, the Sweeten Client Services team stepped in to facilitate an issue and get communication between the homeowner and contractor back on the right track.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubNuCmtu1M8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the approval and permits were all set, the couple and their Sweeten contractor got to work on finding materials that aligned with their vision of a clean, classic black-and-white bathroom. They all went to a showroom together to see what caught the renovators’ eyes, including a dotted marble floor tile. The homeowners love natural stone material, so they opted for a Calacatta porcelain tile for the shower walls. The vanity is a custom piece that ties in the bi-tonal color palette and offers plenty of storage. An offset sink (we’re seeing more and more of these) lends one side of the counter for more storage, too.</span></p>

The contractor&#8217;s designer was the perfect partner for us,” they shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contracting team was diligent about cleaning up the dust every single day since the homeowners were living at home during the renovation. The guest bathroom is near the entryway and was cordoned off for construction. “They all took the job seriously, completed the job with meticulous work, and got it done pretty quickly. We saw real care,” the homeowners said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the timeline shifted a bit given the board approval challenges, once the process got rolling, it was finished in six weeks (and just in time for a birthday party the couple was hosting.) </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The renovators were so amazed by the hard work of each subcontractor that handled the demolition, electrical, lighting, and tiling. “I was struck by the uniformly high quality no matter which team it was,” one homeowner shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Bianco Carrara black dot marble mosaic floor tile; floor stone border in black polished marble; FAP Lumin white matte wall tile 10”x 30”; Fondovalle Calacatta porcelain shower tiles: </span><a href="https://www.tilesbykia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiles by Kia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Our contractors helped reimagine homes in the New York county</h2>
<p>Westchester County offers residents the best of two worlds: the peace and quiet of the suburbs with easy and convenient access to New York City. So it’s no surprise that city dwellers turn to the bucolic region when they’re in need of more space and less noise. Not to mention, the area (which spans 450 square miles) offers an array of home styles, from Victorian and Tudor single-families to smaller Cape Cods and traditional Colonials. Ahead, we highlight a few Sweeten projects from across the county.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34775 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Nilda and Brian’s Tudor colonial home in Rochelle Heights was in perfect condition, with the exception of the dilapidated kitchen. They completely <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-250-square-foot-kitchen-finds-its-bliss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gutted the 250-square-foot space</a> and opened up a wall to install a backdoor to the patio. Design-wise, the couple kept it very classic and clean, with two-tone cabinetry and integrated appliances. Scroll down and listen to how the couple found their general contractor on Sweeten.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34250 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-02.jpg" alt="bathroom vanity" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-02-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-02-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Mother-daughter duo Alissa and Tatiana took on the renovation of Tatiana’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-family-affair-turns-up-the-style-dial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-bedroom condo</a> in Hartsdale. The project—everything from the carpeting to the doors had to go—started one week after closing on the unit, with the goal of creating a bright and light home. Both the kitchen and bathroom were decked out with marble and white cabinetry for a serene look.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32475 mb-0 size-full" title="white-kitchen-peninsula-golden-chairs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01.jpg" alt="white kitchen peninsula with golden chairs and blue kitchen cabinets with silver appliances after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Fourteen years, a trial project, and one bathroom renovation later, Tracey and Brian finally decided to take the plunge on <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-stamp-of-approval-for-a-westchester-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating their kitchen and a powder room</a> in Pelham Manor. They kept all of their existing appliances but brought in all new cabinets, countertops, stenciled floor tiles, and backsplash tile. In the bath, the couple focused on space-saving solutions, including a pocket door and a compact sink.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Alexy-Scholl-Bathroom09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33115 mb-0 size-full" title="long-bathroom-mirror-gray-wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Alexy-Scholl-Bathroom09.jpg" alt="long bathroom mirror on a gray wall in a bathroom with white counter and sink after renovation  " width="1000" height="1498" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Alexy-Scholl-Bathroom09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Alexy-Scholl-Bathroom09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Alexy-Scholl-Bathroom09-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Alexy-Scholl-Bathroom09-723x1083.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Any parent knows a shower-only household isn’t ideal for young children. So before moving into their new house in Pelham, Alexy and her husband decided to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-new-bath-and-tub-for-the-suburbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovate one of the bathrooms</a> first. In order to add a tub, an extended vanity, and a linen closet, their general contractor took square-footage from an adjacent hallway.</p>

<p>Soon after closing on their townhouse in Westchester County, these homeowners decided a kitchen remodel needed to happen as soon as possible. Many of the existing appliances no longer worked, and the dark brown cabinets, beige counters, and vinyl flooring didn’t help matters either. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/shaker-style-simplicity-in-a-pelham-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reconfigured the layout</a> and installed traditional fixtures and appliances.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29717 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>While the location and bones of Brooke and Paul’s new Pelham home were perfect, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/1920s-westchester-home-gets-a-modern-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the kitchen was far from it</a>. They were accustomed to having a large, open space with an island for gathering. To bring the same look and feel to their new cook space, they took down the wall separating the dining room and kitchen, and added an eat-in island in its place. A custom L-shaped dining bench provided another space to enjoy family meals.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Make a bathroom accessible and safe in Brooklyn</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Elaine and her family moved into their brownstone in 1981 and the parlor floor bathroom hadn’t been renovated since. Aside from the outdated fixtures and decor, Elaine’s main focus was to make the bathroom suitable for “aging-in-place.&#8221; The bathroom is on the same floor as the kitchen, so if she ever needed to stay on one floor of the home, she’d have everything she required “My plan is to stay in my house as long as I can,” Elaine said. Design-wise, she wanted the bathroom to be clean, crisp, and something she’d never get tired of. Renovating a bathroom she said, “is like buying a sofa; you’re not just going to get rid of it right away.” When she heard about Sweeten and the selection of vetted, licensed, and insured contractors, Elaine <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27214">posted her project</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brown-tiled-bathroom-with-pink-bathtub"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48856 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="Brown tiled bathroom with pink bathtub before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elaine-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Elaine was matched with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4018">Sweeten general contractor</a> and they clicked instantly. “I could sense that I got along with him very well,” she said. They went to Home Depot together, and he suggested a few stores in Queens with better prices for fixtures and materials.</p>
<p>The bathtub was replaced with a walk-in shower featuring a handicap bar, a separate hand-shower, and a built-in storage nook. Elaine knew she wanted the shower floor to be a little rougher for extra traction, so she opted for a stone-effect material. Even though the bathroom had plenty of space for a separate towel rack, she preferred a clean, clutter-free space with essentials hidden away. The floating vanity provided enough storage for towels, toilet paper, and a hairdryer.</p>

<p>Overall, the renovation process went smoothly. When she ordered the wrong size toilet for the existing plumbing, her contractor helped find a new one for the plumbing. Since there weren’t any major changes to the footprint, they didn’t have to go through the NYC Department of Buildings for approvals, either.</p>

<p>“I was very fortunate I found the right person through Sweeten,” Elaine said. “I love everything about the bathroom.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Two weeks after closing on a Tudor-style townhouse built in 1926—with 4 bedrooms, 2.5 baths, and 1,800 square feet of living space—the homeowners decided that the kitchen renovation would have to happen sooner rather than later. The sense of urgency was propelled by the fact that many of the appliances didn’t work. There were also the ‘70s-era finishes to consider; dark brown cabinets, beige countertops, and vinyl flooring. Planning a gut renovation, the homeowners decided to maintain as much of the existing layout as possible. On the list of must-haves were new cabinets, fresh tile, and updated appliances.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Ready to renovate, the couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and were matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a>. The original placement of the sink under the window made sense, but the placement of the cooktop and double oven—on opposite sides of the kitchen—was inefficient. Plus, with the dining room next door, the built-in dining nook was unnecessary and took up valuable real estate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/kitchen-renovation-cost-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32996 size-chrono" title="Westchester County kitchen renovation costs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GenPost-Embeds-Reno-Westchester-1-723x143.jpg" alt="Westchester County kitchen renovation costs" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although storage wasn’t an issue, the couple decided to add a line of cabinets to the right wall to match the line of cabinets on the opposite side, bringing symmetry to the kitchen layout. White, Shaker-style cabinets were installed along the upper line with a set of gray cabinets beneath them. The backsplash was replaced with white subway tile that reaches the ceiling for a seamless appearance while <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slate floor tile</a> adds rich contrast to the overall neutral palette. The finished space also received the much-needed (working!) new appliances, including a range.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the summer of 2017, Brooke and Paul closed on a 1924 Mediterranean-style home in Pelham, New York. The couple, already living in town, was drawn to the location of the house, perched on a picturesque hillside cul-de-sac in a neighborhood full of young families like their own. The property was designed by architect Guy Mariner, who arrived in Pelham in the early 20th century, making his mark on the suburb&#8217;s historic residential homes and landmarked structures. Their &#8220;new&#8221; old home featured exposed oak beams, beautiful archways, and a barrel-tiled roof—not to mention original faience tiles and leaded-glass windows. The space was almost perfect for them, their kids—Charlotte, Francie, and Teddy—and their two black Labs, Hattie and Reed. There were a few changes that needed to be made to accommodate their busy daily routine.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Their previous home had an expansive, open kitchen with a large island that encouraged casual family gatherings, and it was the go-to spot for baking, art and crafts, and Play-Doh sculptures. In this new house, the kitchen was closed off from the dining room and had lower ceilings. The cabinetry was warped, and the island was “too small for our family of five to gather around,” Brooke explains. The design choices in the kitchen did not match the rest of the house, and the duo wished for an aesthetic befitting the historic architecture of the home while addressing the practical and busy lifestyle of an active family. &#8220;We wanted to create a kitchen that would be functional for everyone to be in without feeling crowded,&#8221; she said. Additionally, the master bath needed a major facelift: a pedestal sink provided no storage and the ancient tub had to go. The pair <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted contractors. They were quickly matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>, who they asked to design and install the kitchen, along with a new vanity in the master bath.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Brooke and Paul embarked on the renovation process without having first lived in the home, which presented some challenges. They weren’t sure how they would use the space, but they did know that they wanted adequate storage, a more open kitchen/dining area, and a large island. Their Sweeten contractor took this information and came up with a solution that incorporated their wishlist. First, they took down the wall separating the dining room and the kitchen and added a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large island</a> in its place. “It was also very important to me to have an island that curved out so that when we gathered around to eat, we weren’t in a straight line,” says Brooke.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/kitchen-renovation-cost-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32996 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Westchester County kitchen renovation costs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GenPost-Embeds-Reno-Westchester-1-723x143.jpg" alt="Westchester County kitchen renovation costs" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given the age of the house, the ceiling in the kitchen was quite low and not level. They would have lost two inches if they attempted to level the entire surface. The solution: their contractor carefully integrated the cabinets within the out-of-level areas and cut the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moldings</a> in a certain way to give the appearance of an even ceiling. Brooke tells us, “I struggled with designing a kitchen that I hadn’t lived in before, but our Sweeten contractor was great to work with; he blended my suggestions into his designs and I’m thrilled with how it turned out.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt10.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29722 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt10.gif" alt="renovator Westchester" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple also chose to install a microwave drawer (a favorite), an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/refrigerator-chill-world-fridge-freezer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extra-large fridge</a>, and two refrigerator drawers just for beverages. Brooke reports that she loves her blue patterned tile backsplash, a splurge that really embraces the Mediterranean architecture of the home. She went with marble for the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a>; after examining other options, she couldn’t find a substitute that would give the feel she was looking for. A soft gray paint complemented the white cabinetry and blue island. The configuration of the new kitchen, which not only combined the dining room but also opened up the existing butler’s pantry, created a better flow and an easier space for the family to congregate. A custom L-shaped dining bench, topped with cheerful blue and yellow pillows, was the final touch to a warm, happy space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bath, their Sweeten contractor was tasked with <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating a vanity</a> that could hold a laundry hamper as well as toiletries and other daily necessities. He worked with the small footprint, since moving the plumbing fixtures would have meant going over budget. In the end, however, Brooke and Paul took about a foot from an adjacent bedroom to fashion a slightly larger space. The new vanity is topped with marble and utilizes all the space available. A walk-in shower with pebbled tile floors replaced the old tub, and a bold custom blue paint was the final touch for a fresh new space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that the renovation is complete, Brooke shares one of her major lessons learned: Paint colors never look the way you expect them to. “I had eight swatches of gray and greige paint on the [kitchen] walls for weeks and finally decided on Wickham Gray from Benjamin Moore. The day the contractor was painting the kitchen, I was working from home. I came downstairs to see a neighbor, and she immediately said, ‘I didn’t know you were going green in the kitchen.’ So we turned around and went with Gray Owl [another Benjamin Moore paint] instead.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Marrying an old house with modern life also meant taking time to figure out how the family wanted to live and use the space. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t been in our home for six months yet, so there&#8217;s still movement in how and where I store things as we get settled,&#8221; explains Brooke. During the demolition, they discovered a time capsule buried by previous owners containing a newspaper clipping dating from the first day of the Iraq War, as well as some information about the family and neighbors. And now, their own house history begins.</p>
