<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Give an outdated kitchen a media nook and more storage in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Rosalind, a business analyst, and her husband, Lawrence, longed to return to Brooklyn after a decade in Long Island. In 2015, they decided to downsize and bought a 100-year-old house in the neighborhood of Cypress Hills. Over time, they renovated two bathrooms, the stairway, and a walk-in closet. “The kitchen was last,” said Rosalind. It was functional, but didn’t suit Rosalind’s taste and the floors were flimsy. “There were holes that had been roughly covered with other flooring,” she said. The limited cabinet space also meant storing larger kitchen equipment, like the slow cooker and cake mixer, in the living room. Rosalind cooks four to five times a week, so heading into the living room to get what she needed grew old, fast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Once she <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20522" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors—the couple’s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> worked fast and completed the job in five weeks. There were only two weeks where the kitchen couldn’t be used (Rosalind and Lawrence went out to eat a lot). While much of the layout stayed the same, Rosalind wanted to take advantage of the kitchen window that looked out over the backyard, so the kitchen sink was lined up with the window to make washing up more enjoyable. The wooden cabinets, yellow walls, and orange backsplash tiles<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>some with sketches of fruit on them<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>had to go. Instead, Rosalind went with a sleek gray palette with a quartz <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertop</a> that looked like marble. The different gray tones she picked meshed perfectly with the hues of gray, as well as sage, in other rooms on that floor of the house. To move the appliances from the living room and into the cook space, the couple added a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen island</a>. It now doubles as both <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> and as a gathering point when friends and family come over.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: With plenty of time spent in the kitchen, Rosalind wanted some entertainment. “I like to watch TV while I cook,” she said. The solution: installing a “media station,” which included a 32-inch flatscreen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Clinton Hill renovation brings upgrades from the kitchen to a tough wood flooring decision</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">British expat Sam and her American husband, Sean, had been living in Park Slope for several years when they made the decision to find a place to buy. While they casually searched in Park Slope and its surrounding neighborhoods, they also prepared their finances and readied themselves for when it came time to make an offer. A fortuitous series of events led them to bid on—and win!—the first apartment they visited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten <span class="s1">shares</span> their (enviably easy) search and how they transformed a long-empty, rundown apartment into a beautiful home for a growing family.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23093 size-full" title="Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having heard horror stories from friends who suffered through multiple failed bids, Sam and Sean anticipated a difficult process. They imagined that they might also face rejection, so they jumped into the process with an offer after their first open house visit in the nearby Clinton Hill neighborhood.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">They realized that the space was old and hadn’t been lived in for quite some time, but were able to see past the grimy kitchen and bath, as well as the worn floors and peeling paint in this two-bedroom apartment in the famed Clinton Hill Co-ops (<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we’re big fans</a>, as you know). The large bedrooms were a big plus, while the generous common area could open up even further by removing walls separating the kitchen from the dining and living rooms. Otherwise, the size and layout were exactly right for their family of four, and they would remain within commuting distance to their daycare. The listed price also left room in their budget for the renovation the apartment so desperately needed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When the discussion came around to renovation at the Open House, the listing agent, <span style="color: #000000;">Tom Stuart</span> (who coincidentally also lived in the CHCs), mentioned that Sweeten would be an option for their project, given the ever-growing list of Sweeten alumni in the complex. So as they went into contract, Sam <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/10514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> and requested bids from contractors. A Sweeten contractor fit the bill, and they got to work updating the apartment after a slight delay in obtaining approval from the board and managing agent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To create a feeling of spaciousness, walls were knocked down to open sight lines between all of the common areas. (With two kids under five, this was especially important.) Sam wanted the kitchen to feel as large as possible by New York City standards, since the couple cooks frequently. The contractor closed off one of the openings between the hallway and the kitchen, so that a pantry and refrigerator could be installed in that space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the opposite side of the kitchen, in place of the old walls framing the dining area, a peninsula was installed for additional counter space and storage. The sink was moved out of a cramped corner, and placed alongside the dishwasher for ease of access. Sam chose to go with stock cabinets for the affordability factor. (Also, by this point, they learned that Sam was pregnant with their third child, meaning that this was unlikely to be their forever home!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When considering the palette, soothing neutrals provided a subtle backdrop to the inevitable and colorful chaos that always accompanies kids and their toys. In terms of storage, the full-length pantry was outfitted with pull-out drawers for maximum accessibility. Drawers were also installed in the peninsula instead of shelves. The kitchen design also included a Lazy Susan in the upper corner, so that hard-to-reach items in the back wouldn&#8217;t be a problem. Lastly, an integrated garbage bin kept the trash out of sight.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Deciding early on they did not want the hassle of obtaining plumbing permits, the couple left the fixtures in their original locations and instead focused on finding brighter, cleaner replacement options. They carried the same neutral look in the small bathroom, installing open shelving, a large mirror, and a metal-legged console sink to reduce the feeling of clutter. Behind the mirror is a spacious medicine cabinet for toiletries. And although a console sink meant no storage underneath—a brave choice for a family bathroom!—Sam reports that they’ve had no problems on that front, given the large hallway closet right outside the bath. For tile, a classic white subway tile on the walls and a subtly-patterned cement tile on the floor set a tranquil feel, while Pottery Barn lighting rounded out the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the rest of the apartment, the couple’s Sweeten contractor also refinished the floors and installed carpet over the hardwood in the bedrooms. Sam confides that it was Sean’s preference and she was initially unswayed, knowing it would be a controversial choice. But having lived with it now for a few months, they love the softness underfoot, especially for playing with their kids. (Plus, the wood remains intact and an option for restoration in the future.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the two closets in the master bedroom were combined into one, and the entire apartment was <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/skim-coating-in-5-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim-coated</a> and repainted. One thing that Sam wished they had done—and are now in the process of doing—was to paint and finish the undersides of the cabinets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23093 size-full" title="Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, the duo attempted to visit the work site regularly. In fact, this is her tip to future renovators: “Go to the apartment every week, at the very least. At first, we only visited on the weekends, when we had time. But the contractors weren’t working then. We realized that checking in at some point during working hours was a huge help, and that things went more smoothly when we did that, even though it was a pain. We could discuss issues as they came up, and see what they were talking about.” The renovation was completed within four months, allowing them to turn their attention to their next major project, a new baby!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thanks to Sam, Sean, Ellie, Ernie, and baby Alice, for sharing your home! We hope that you’ll make some great memories in that gorgeous space. (Special thanks to Sam for sending over the list of resources on her due date!)</em></p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Carroll Gardens homeowner Kim Solop </span></i></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After ten years of living in our Carroll Gardens condo, we really needed a change. We contemplated a move to the suburbs or upgrading to a bigger place in a less popular Brooklyn neighborhood. After almost a year of looking and being priced out in our current neighborhood, we decided to renovate our current place, a two-bed, two-bath, 1,200 square-foot condo that we bought in 2006. We loved our current neighborhood with its proximity to our workplaces, lots of cute restaurants, shops, and our two sons’ schools. The problems were in the apartment itself: I was unhappy with the dark kitchen—I always had been. I love taking baths but hated the jet tub that was installed over a decade ago. Lastly, our laundry closet had a lot of wasted space and I wanted to add a walk-in pantry!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a big fan of home decor blogs, I had been stalking the Sweeten site for a while, and really loved seeing the transformations that the contractors could do with space. I was excited for the chance to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/15462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our renovation</a>. I met with a couple of them, and decided on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>. I really clicked with the project managers and could see that we would have a good partnership.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My main objective for the kitchen was to brighten it up and eliminate the space between the cabinets and the ceiling. I hated how this wasted space looked and the amount of dust it collected. After a few weeks of sourcing materials, we were ready to go! I knew from the get-go that I wanted a white kitchen, as well as shaker-style cabinets with quartz countertops that were marble look-alikes. Other than that, I was pretty open to ideas. Our contractor came over with a wealth of ideas for how we could open the kitchen up to maximize light. (Unfortunately, there are no windows in the kitchen, so there was only so much we could do.) I debated another set of cabinets on top of the current ones, but eventually decided against it. I switched gears a bit on the white color palette, choosing instead a dual-tone kitchen with white uppers and gray lower cabinets. After living with long pulls, I decided to go with smaller handles on all the cabinetry. Quartz countertops were also a must, for the durability factor! With two kids and a husband who are not always the neatest, I knew that we needed a tough work surface. I was adamant about getting a wine fridge. As members of a few wine clubs, we struggled to find space to keep our wine at the right temperatures.</p>

<p>Our microwave above the range was replaced with a microwave drawer, and a hood was installed above the stovetop instead. With the new wine fridge taking up precious cabinet space, I did lose a place for pots and pans. Our contractor was able to give me deep drawers in the pantry to make up for this lost storage. My other kitchen must-haves were a deep, white porcelain sink, and an under-counter pull-out garbage can.</p>

<p>Across the kitchen was a room that held just the washer and dryer with inaccessible space that was wasted. When we extended the wall, there was room for a customized pantry with countertops, shelving, and cabinetry that matched the kitchen. After not having a pantry for so long, it’s amazing to have one, and the additional space has really been a lifesaver. I had envisioned barn doors, but there was not enough wall space for it. The double doors we ended up hanging looked so plain and boring. I had some wallpaper left over from the hallway&#8211;so I went for it and covered the doors too. I think it turned out nicely.</p>

<p>For the bathroom, I wanted a totally new look that was modern and clean. We went with dark floors, a deep soaking tub, and a floating vanity. Our contractor showed me a picture of another bathroom he did, and I loved it so much, we copied it almost exactly. It came out perfectly and I am fighting my older son almost daily for baths! The tub is divine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We actually lived in the space during the whole renovation, which lasted about seven weeks. It was definitely challenging and required a lot of patience. The contractor and his crew were great about cleaning up, however, and we made the best of it with lots of takeout dinners.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading the Sweeten blog for so many years, it was exciting to embark on my own renovation. I realized that renovating is messy and dirty, and almost always takes longer than you had originally anticipated. You learn to roll with the punches, and realize that things happen. We had a few hiccups along the way, such as wanting the barn door on the pantry that wasn’t going to work, so I learned to compromise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoyed working with our Sweeten contractor,  who made himself available at all hours. He was in constant communication and has remained a friend to this day. We love our new kitchen and other improvements, and are planning on staying to enjoy them for many years to come!</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kitchen expansion</a> in a studio apartment in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Giovanni, a Brooklyn-based doctor was looking to trade in his modern high-rise lifestyle for something with more history. This new studio, in a historic townhouse, offered original wood floors and the promise of exposing structural bricks beneath the plaster. The very basic and uninspired kitchen, however, was a distinct liability. Shoved into a shallow alcove, it had entry-level appliances and only a few inexpensive cabinets.<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Giovanni’s co-op approved his renovation proposal to combine a small closet and the alcove into an open plan for both cooking and laundry, so he turned to Sweeten for his project. His <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> helped shape the vision, and was “very good at telling me what was feasible.” Giovanni says. Breaking the plaster surface off structural brick walls proved an inexpensive way to add texture to the plain-vanilla apartment. Enlarging the kitchen footprint slightly, he added an eat-in peninsula to hide the washer-dryer while keeping pipes in roughly the same position. The backsplash is clad with matte gray subway tiles. To keep costs down, black-painted butcher block countertops offer a warmer temperature than stone. Overhead, a dropped ceiling provided space for new electrical wiring, for the high-tech pendants over the breakfast bar and for recessed lighting.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Glossy white cabinets look lush, and using stainless trim above lifts the dropped ceiling by helping it appear to float.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: <a href="https://www.geappliances.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE</a> appliances, <a href="https://www.lg.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG</a> compact combo washer-dryer, <a href="https://www.build.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kichler</a> pendant lighting from Build.com, matte-grey subway tiles for the backsplash.</p>
