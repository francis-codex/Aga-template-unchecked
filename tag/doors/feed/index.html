										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Proper bedroom walls finally go up in a family home</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33300 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls06-723x482.jpg" alt="open-plan layout renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Located in the heart of downtown Brooklyn, the 808-square-foot apartment&#8217;s open layout, high ceilings, and a southeast-facing wall of windows were the main attractions for Sophie, a freelance translator and stay-at-home mom, and Michael, operations manager at Bureau van Dijk. After living there for four years, the couple really wanted to create a defined space for their 2-year-old son, Zacharia, and a baby girl soon to arrive in May, that the siblings could claim as their own. As part of the remodel, they wanted to carve out a peaceful space for themselves to relax as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The building, an eight-story concrete structure that was once a toy factory, was converted to 56 condos around 2005. The couple loved the industrial look of the apartment, especially the big concrete column, and high ceilings with exposed HVAC metal vent. However, the divider wall that split the loft layout into what Sophie said was “kinda two bedrooms,” didn’t go up to the ceiling and had no doors, so there was no sound isolation or privacy. Also, she said, “the second bedroom was really tiny and didn&#8217;t have much light coming through.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With clear goals in mind, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/26018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4604" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with their contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls-Before01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33301 size-chrono" title="floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls-Before01-723x1085.jpg" alt="open-plan layout renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls-Before03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33303 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls-Before03-723x482.jpg" alt="open-plan layout renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33304 mb-0 size-chrono" title="red-winged-chair-living-room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02-723x482.jpg" alt="red winged chair in living room with panelled window and brown floor after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new wall would help them shape the modern and industrial look that complemented the building. Since this project was about defining living spaces, it focused on function over style, although, Sophie said, “the resulting look of the space was important to us, and we tried making conscious design choices to match our style.” They chose hardware with linear shapes while traditional base moldings were replaced with straight profiles, along with trim around the door frames.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If asked to prioritize between an entrance hall and a children&#8217;s bedroom in NYC, the bedroom wins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To increase the size of the kids’ bedroom and keep enough space for their own bedroom, Sophie and Michael tested various configurations for every feature they wanted using 3-D renderings from the software program Sketch Up. Their decision-making process was guided by such questions as: “How far should they extend the bedrooms?”, “Would the kids’ room allow them to grow with a bunk bed?”, “How much natural light would reach the space?”, and “How high/big should the transom window be?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls01.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33305 mb-0 size-chrono" title="gray-walled-living-room-blue-bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls01.gif" alt="gray walled living room with view of blue bedroom and nursery after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We had a fair amount of square footage in the hall entrance, which was not well-used,” Sophie said. “If asked to prioritize between an entrance hall and a children&#8217;s bedroom in New York City, the bedroom wins. The presence of a sprinkler limited us, but we were able to take two feet [width-wise].” And now, two strollers can still fit in the hallway. “It’s a win-win,” Sophie said. Extending one extra foot lengthwise helped to accommodate more furniture for the kids while leaving sufficient space in the dining area. “For the master, we decided not to extend it by that same one foot because it would have brought the wall to the middle of the windows, reducing our living room too much and affecting the amount of natural light coming through,” she explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33307 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-723x482.jpg" alt="open-plan layout renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33306 mb-0 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls05-723x482.jpg" alt="open-plan layout renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While they had some initial concerns that the bump-out would break the flow of the apartment, “it actually helped create a better flow and even defined a separation between our living room area and our dining room area since there’s a virtual line where the wall comes forward. And the kids’ bedroom is now a usable and decent-sized room.” Their Sweeten contractor also found a solution to connect the HVAC vent to the rooms and keep them flush with the walls rather than extending outward into the room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To preserve as much natural light as possible the living space and bedrooms, they designed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/transom-windows-let-the-light-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transom</a> between the two bedrooms and opted for pocket doors. “We wanted the kids to have a French door,” Sophie said, but they would have swung too widely into the apartment and taken up too much space. The soft-close <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pocket doors</a> were painted a darker stain to contrast against lighter walls. It was also a departure from the red tone found in their wood floors—which they weren’t fans of. “That will be yet another project,” she noted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every renovation comes with a little stress. In this case, since the whole family had no sleeping quarters for a while, they moved to an Airbnb for about two weeks. “That didn’t leave much flexibility in the timeline for unexpected surprises,” Sophie said. “Fortunately, our contractor stuck to the deadline with just a little bit of delay, but it was still manageable.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33309 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls04-723x1085.jpg" alt="open-plan layout renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33308 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls03-723x1085.jpg" alt="open-plan layout renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They felt it was great to have Sweeten&#8217;s assistance from the start, giving them more confidence than just randomly searching the Internet on their own. “The process to schedule appointments with the contractors was fast and efficient,” Sophie said. “Knowing that we could contact one specific person at Sweeten&#8217;s client services if an issue arose compared to just having a generic email address is reassuring.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before a renovation, “you think you&#8217;ve covered your bases, but there are so many details, it’s sometimes hard not to get overwhelmed,” Sophie said. Choosing paint colors was one of the things that became maddening. It’s one thing to see it on paper or in 3-D on the computer, but “you&#8217;re not really sure how it feels until you actually see the space in person,” she said. Admittedly obsessed with finding the right shade, she explained, “We ended up picking up all the inspiration books and samples we could find at the hardware store; then I&#8217;d compare all the colors to pictures on Pinterest, going back and forth on nearly identical shades.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple is “extremely happy with how the kids’ bedroom turned out,” Sophie said. Now that the renovation is finished, and the nursery has doors to close, Zacharia has a quiet place to rest during nap time and at night. And, said Sophie, “having defined spaces makes it a lot easier to keep our apartment feel put together.”</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22112 mb-10 size-chrono" title="narrow-white-foyer-gray-panelled-doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-01-723x505.jpg" alt="narrow white foyer with gray panelled doors and hanging accent lights after renovation" width="723" height="505" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-01-723x505.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-01-300x210.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-01-600x419.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hissan-sophias-kitchen-foyer-renovation-downtown-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hissan and Sophia</a>&#8216;s apartment in Brooklyn</span></p>
<p>Although open-concept living has become the norm, most homes still need a <i>few</i> doors here and there to provide privacy and to delineate spaces. And while you might not have given it much thought, there’s a lot to consider when choosing interior doors. Read on for an in-depth look at the right questions to ask, material and feature options, and the costs associated with inside entryways.</p>
<h3><strong>Factors before buying interior doors</strong></h3>
<h4>Interior door soundproofing</h4>
<p>This may vary depending on the location and the kind of spaces that need to be closed off. Interior doors come with a “sound transmission class” (STC) rating, which measures the level of sound loss. The higher the number, the greater the sound buffer.</p>
<h4><strong>Are you painting or staining your interior door?</strong></h4>
<p>Your answer will help you narrow down the type of materials you consider, since only certain types can be stained (see below). If you plan to paint, you can choose from the full range of options.</p>
<h4><strong>Do you need a door slab or a pre-hung door?</strong></h4>
<p>This depends on whether there is an existing frame: a slab is the door itself, and a pre-hung includes all of the installation parts, including the frame, hinges, and knob. Slabs are cheaper.</p>
<h4><b>Simple styles are easier on budgets</b></h4>
<p>Simpler styles tend to be less expensive (think minimalist slab versus ornate multi-panels) when all else is equal.</p>
<h4>Costs for interior doors</h4>
<p>Interior door costs span as low as $25, to a headier $1,000 or more; so having a target budget will narrow your field to a more manageable set of choices.</p>
<h3><b>Interior door materials</b></h3>
<p>Several kinds of materials are available to achieve the practicality and the look that you want. In rough order of cost from least to most expensive, doors can be hollow core, solid core, solid wood, or metal. Within the selection of both hollow core and solid core, there are molded or MDF options.</p>
<h4><strong>Hollow core interior doors</strong></h4>
<p>This means that the interior of the door is filled with cardboard baffle or another similar light material. Given the inexpensive construction, they are very affordable but do little to prevent any sound transfer or provide insulation. They are not optimal for fire safety, and are easily dented but good for paint-grade applications. Starts at $25.</p>
<h4><strong>Solid core interior doors</strong></h4>
<p>These doors are made of composite wood on the interior, with a wood veneer on the exterior. Composites are extremely dense, and therefore heavier than a solid wood door. High-density limits sound transfer, making them an excellent fit for bathrooms and bedrooms. Sometimes, a solid core door can be made of a single slab of more affordable wood, such as pine, that is faced with a more expensive wood, such as teak. Other notable qualities are their durability and weather resistance. Solid core doors can be painted or stained. Starts at $50, but averages around $200.</p>
<h4><strong>Molded doors</strong></h4>
<p>These doors are created from fiberglass or wood byproducts that have been molded to look like wooden doors. They can be either hollow or solid core. Good for painting, but not suitable for staining. Ranges from $20 to $150.</p>
<h4><strong>MDF doors</strong></h4>
<p>Medium-density fiberboard (&#8220;MDF&#8221;) is an engineered wood product. Generally considered higher quality than molded doors, they are also heavier, block sound better, and come in either hollow or solid core. Also good for painting, but not suitable for staining. Starts at $30.</p>
<h4><strong>Solid wood interior doors</strong></h4>
<p>This type of door is made entirely from natural wood. Depending on the species of tree, the wood can range widely in terms of sound transfer. Pine, for example, is lightweight compared to mahogany, which is very heavy, and thus a sound-deadening option. They tend to be the most expensive option and can be more customizable. They are more susceptible to changes in climate. Solid wood is easily painted, stained, or left as is for a more rustic look. Starts at $100, but averages around $500 to $1,000 for quality hardwood.</p>
<h4><strong>Metal interior doors</strong></h4>
<p>Metal doors are rare for interiors, but are increasingly popular. They tend to be made of steel and glass and create an industrial or loft-like feel to separate an office or library space. They are the heaviest option and may even require reinforcing to make sure that the surrounding frame can withstand the weight. While they don’t dent easily, they do scratch. Metal can be painted. Starts at $100, but can run into the thousands of dollars.</p>
<h3><b>Features and options for interior doors</b></h3>
<p>Numerous configurations achieve different goals: some doors can accentuate a space while others minimize attention to an awkward spot. You can keep it simple with a single point of entry or double up for a more dramatic look.</p>
<h4><strong>The basic, single door</strong></h4>
<p>When going with a single door, you will need to decide how you want it to open (called “door handing”)—choosing from left-hand or right-hand options. Keep in mind that, to keep paths clear, doors should not open into hallways. This handy<a href="https://www.archtoolbox.com/materials-systems/doors-windows/door-handing.html" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.archtoolbox.com/materials-systems/doors-windows/door-handing.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1488377178472000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcTD1DrnzdoqUARuwTd0m7blv4ew" rel="noopener"> diagram</a> tells you what is what (it can be kind of confusing!). Double doors are either center-swing or sliding.</p>
<h4><strong>Choose style and function for your door</strong></h4>
<p>You can also consider double entryways, commonly referred to as French doors, which have glass panes down their full length, a great option for connecting two rooms you might want to be open to each other. Other options are sliding features, like a sliding panel that slides across the surface of the wall behind it (and remains visible). Alternately, pocket doors disappear into the wall when opened. Bi-fold doors (also known as folding) are traditionally used for closet spaces, but glass versions can also be used to open a living space up to the outdoors. You could also opt for ones that are louvered, which allows air and some light to pass through its slats. And while not commonly seen in many homes, there’s no reason you couldn’t have a Dutch door in your kitchen! While these more unusual options will not be as effective at blocking sound transfer, they will certainly add more character than a typical single door.</p>
<h3><strong>Weight and size of interior doors</strong></h3>
<p>Lastly, in terms of dimensions, interior doors come in four levels of thickness and three widths. The thinnest is 1 3/8 inches, then 1 1/2, 1 5/8, with the thickest 1 3/4 inches. They range from 28 to 32 inches wide, and are usually 80 inches in height. Closet openings can be just 78 inches tall, so they will also usually be widely available. If you have a frame already in place, you’ll need to ensure that your new slab matches the existing dimensions.</p>
<p>Given the variety of options to choose from, first narrowing it down in terms of the most important criterion (such as soundproofing capability or cost) will help to streamline the process.</p>
