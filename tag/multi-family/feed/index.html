			<h2>A guide for converting these classic Chicago multi-family homes into single-family dwellings</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chicago-2-3-flat-buildings-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-58040 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chicago-2-3-flat-buildings-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chicago-2-3-flat-buildings-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chicago-2-3-flat-buildings-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re searching for a single-family home in Chicago, availability and price may be a stumbling block, especially in some parts of the city. But there is another option. Take a look at two or three-flats. Consider a deconversion, where a multi-family building is converted into a multistory, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-family home</a>. We outline</span><span class="s1"> what you should know about making a multi-family your very own. <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors share their insights on what they&#8217;re seeing on the remodeling front.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Avondale, Lincoln Park, Logan Square, Lakeview, and Andersonville there is an abundance of multi-family housing stock, with a price range of just under $500,000 to just under $900,000. Many multi-family homes, typically built between 1900 and 1920, are brick or Greystone, and have two or three stories, with an <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/chicago-condo-remodel-of-a-fixer-upper-new-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment on each floor</a>. There&#8217;s often a bay in the front and rear porch with exterior stairs on the back and an unfinished basement or garden apartment.</span></p>
<h3>What’s the advantage of deconverting a multi-family home?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The neighborhood is the main attraction. Potential homeowners may already rent there and like it or are attracted to schools, shopping, and the overall architectural “feel” and mix of a streetscape or area.</span></p>
<h3>What makes a good candidate for deconversion?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, says Sweeten general contractor Ryan, the bones of a two- or three-flat will be good for deconversion, especially in brick construction. Another <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/remodeling-old-house-vintage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advantage is that older buildings</a> often have original woodwork, crown moldings, hardwood flooring, and features like fireplaces, in addition to plaster walls.</span></p>
<h3>How long does it take?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six months is an average time frame for deconverting a multi-family home. If there’s a garden apartment, some homeowners opt to live in it <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during the construction</a>.</span></p>
<h3>What’s involved and what’s an average cost?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That depends on the condition of the building. If you’re lucky, there’s little to do on the exterior—unless windows or skylights are being added, roof repaired or replaced. In the simplest deconversion, it’s a matter of reconfiguring space, some gutting, rerouting, or adding in new plumbing and electrical. Be sure to work with <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the right general contractor</a> who is licensed, insured, and up-to-date with local codes and regulations. You&#8217;ll want to meet and compare estimates from at least three <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/chicago-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractors in your area</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A typical multi-family deconversion project will include opening the first floor, building out a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new kitchen along with its costs</a>, replacing the second-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">floor kitchen with a master suite,” says Ryan. The cost is similar to a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2020-home-renovation-costs-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole-house remodel</a>, so a mid-range two-flat deconversion is around $250,000. But for smaller buildings, say around 2,500 square feet, the work can be done for under $100,000.</span></p>

<h3>Opening up the first floor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard Chicago city lots are 25 by 125 feet. Most two- and three-flats have a load-bearing wall that runs the length of the building, which chops up the layout and minimizes the size of rooms. Removing that wall to maximize space requires shoring up, which can be accomplished by several means, such as sistering floor joists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not a disadvantage to scare you off of <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/renovating-design-trends-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designing a home</a>,” says <span style="color: #333333;">Sweeten contractor Ryan</span>. “And it’s not a significant cost when you’re talking about gaining more living space.” </span></p>
<h3>Expanding the kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you begin the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/how-to-remodel-a-kitchen-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning for an upgraded kitchen</a>, these rooms are in the back in most buildings; so borrowing space from smaller rooms allows for <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expansion of the kitchen&#8217;s</a> footprint. For example, some old buildings have enclosed back porches that can be opened up. Reorienting and combining spaces usually requires taking walls down to the studs and planning for updated appliances. </span></p>
<h3>Reconfiguring the second floor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a master bedroom suite, which includes a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new or existing bathroom</a> and a walk-in closet, is a top priority. There may also be an existing sitting room, which doubles as a family room. One large or two small bedrooms with a bath also suit the plan.</span></p>
<h3>Moving stairs</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there are two separate entries, with two sets of stairs, one obviously needs to go. The other set might be retained—or rebuilt in a new location. Porch or fire stairs on the backside of the structure are often removed. If the foundation is good, that space might be incorporated into the first and second-floor plans. On the first floor, that could mean extra room for the kitchen, or perhaps a breakfast room. On the second level, extra square footage might translate into a master sitting room.</span></p>
<h2><b>Finishing a basement</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the plan is to make your <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/basement/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement a living space</a>, older buildings typically have a ceiling height under eight feet. However, the ceiling can be raised eight to 10 inches without underpinning; that is, excavating beneath the existing foundation and pouring new footings, which is a necessity when raising a foot or more. This usually is done by lowering the floor down to the footings—which can be as much as 12 inches—then pouring a new concrete floor. Buffing, staining, and polishing that concrete may be a more cost-effective solution than installing high-quality vinyl tile, carpeting, or engineered hardwood. </span></p>
<h3>Toxic materials</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With older buildings, launching into any major alteration can result in unanticipated costs. Sometimes there are happy surprises—like finding beautiful pocket doors that have been buried in walls. But with any structure more than 50 years old, there may be toxic or health-threatening materials that are dangerous when not properly removed. Paint containing lead, for example, needs to be stripped carefully. Asbestos is another material that may be present in pre-1980 insulation and ceiling tiles as well as older linoleum flooring and vinyl tile backings. To remove it requires encapsulation (sealing the surface to prevent fibers from becoming airborne) according to EPA standards.</span></p>
<h2><b>HVAC systems</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With two or more apartments designed for multiple families, infrastructure is in place. There will be as many heating and/or cooling systems. Depending on age, they may need to be replaced to improve efficiency. Here are the average lifespans:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furnaces: 15 &#8211; 20 years. Consider two furnaces that are zoned for efficiency and energy savings.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central air conditioning units: 10 &#8211; 15 years</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hot water heaters: 7 &#8211; 10 years</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tankless water heaters: 20 years</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrading electrical and plumbing</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buildings more than 50 years old probably are candidates for upgrading mechanicals. If there’s not already a 200 amp service in place, this is an obvious upgrade. Depending on how high end the project is, and how many electrical systems, devices, smart lighting, and dimmers there are, you might consider a 400 amp service. Even if you didn’t need this much power, planning for the future—with a $3,000-$4,000 additional cost—may be more cost-effective. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plumbing may need to be upgraded with the addition of fixtures and new plumbing lines for a second sink or a second-floor tub or shower. New sewer and water systems can range between $15,000 and $25,000 but are necessary when adding fixtures and will also boost pressure. </span></p>
<h3>Adding insulation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We try not to touch plaster walls,” says Ryan. “It’s a big expense. But plaster also is well-insulating in temperature and sound. Spray foam is used in areas where it’s undesirable to remove walls.”</span></p>
<h3>Flooring</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Original hardwood flooring can be sanded and re-stained, or damaged boards may be replaced; which is necessary to transition between rooms that have been eliminated. With standard 2 ½ inch-wide oak flooring, it’s pretty easy to match. Even maple, sometimes found in older properties, can be matched.</span></p>
<p>Deconverting a multi-family home into a single home is an undertaking that leads you to even more square footage of living. Understand and plan for all of the elements and be sure to have the right renovation team supporting your vision.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A two-family becomes a single home for a couple and their furry friends</h2>
<p><em>Carol and Jon felt as if they’d won the lottery when they found their first home, a charming, two-story detached place—gray with black shutters, built in 1926—on the western edge of Jersey City. While Jon, a lawyer working with startups, and Carol, who does policy work for a national homelessness nonprofit, had great ideas for renovating, they knew this house would be a challenge: It was an up-down duplex and their dream was to turn it into a single-family residence. But with Sweeten&#8217;s help, the renovation turned out great—and was even featured in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/28/couple-crafts-delightful-bunny-mansion-for-their-beloved-pets/">New York Post</a>. </em></p>

<em>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Carol</em></p>
<p>This was the very first house we toured and it had everything we wanted, including a backyard, driveway, and garage. Best of all, it was around the corner from my beloved <em>tia</em> (Spanish for &#8220;aunt&#8221;), so we can have coffee with her every day. We loved our home, but there were challenges: the electrical had to be upgraded and we had to move radiators around to accommodate the kitchen renovation.</p>

<p>With the ultimate goal to make two spaces into one cohesive home, we knew we’d need to save money. So when we first moved in, we made just a few aesthetic changes. We painted the entire space, including the kitchen cabinets, and we had a family friend remove not one, but two drop ceilings in the kitchen. We added a few new light fixtures and fabulous bunny wallpaper from Anthropologie.</p>
<p>We decided to play the role of landlord, living on the first floor of the house with our four rabbits and three cats while we <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/renovate-your-rental-property-wisely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rented out the top floor</a>. We knew that the renovation process would take time, money and patience, but that it would be worth it.</p>

<p>After two years of saving, we were ready to take on the full renovation. We browsed Sweeten&#8217;s Instagram page for inspiration, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27631" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten,</a> and were matched with an amazing contractor. He really helped this not-so-handy couple transform our kitchen into the perfect space to cook and entertain, and prepare the rest of the house for the next renovation phase: turning the house from a double to a single-family home.</p>
<p>During the renovation, we moved into the upstairs unit and lived without a stove with our seven pets, as well as a cat and her two kittens we were fostering for JerseyCats, a local cat rescue. We weren&#8217;t prepared for the renovation to take as long as it did. We started demolition at the end of March and finished early August. Waiting for permits held stuff up a lot. We were sort of over the whole process very quickly. Fortunately, our contractor was always there to help.</p>

Have I mentioned the bunny wallpaper? Early in our relationship, Jon was in law school and I was in graduate school. We thought bunnies would be low-maintenance pets. HA! Now, we can&#8217;t get enough.</p>
<p>We also wanted to increase storage and counter space and create direct access to the backyard through the kitchen.</p>

<p>To enlarge the kitchen, we tore down a wall and took space from an existing bedroom. One of my must-haves was a big kitchen island. I love to cook and host parties for my friends and family, and everyone always ends up in the kitchen. I kept imagining a huge island surrounded by those I love. I really wanted it to be different and for the cabinets underneath (and the lower perimeter cabinets) to be colorful. I&#8217;ve been going through a green phase. I came across swatches of Benjamin Moore Pine Green and was immediately inspired. I’ll admit, I&#8217;m obsessed with the island.</p>

The contractor also created a new door out of an existing window that allowed direct access to the backyard. For more storage, he came up with the double-door pantry, knowing I wanted enough space for my microwave and all of my cooking appliances.</p>

He took charge of redesigning the entry foyer and exposing an existing staircase, which had been hidden behind a wall. Removing that wall and adding a banister made the two-family feel disappear. We are now able to go upstairs without having to go through the foyer.</p>

It&#8217;s such an old house that the panel is in the back of the house, so upgrading it entirely would have been a much larger endeavor.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the renovation was seeing the space transform day to day. One of my favorite moments was walking in and seeing the kitchen gutted to its frame. It was hard to even imagine how beautiful it would turn out. It was exciting and surreal. Despite the delays and being (slightly) over budget, we are in love with our home and would go through it all again.</p>
