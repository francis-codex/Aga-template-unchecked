<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Houston </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-houston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-houston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Whether you’ve got a bungalow in Houston Heights, a Craftsman cottage in Montrose, or an apartment in downtown, it’s time to make your Houston home your own. </span><span class="s2"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>&#8216;s</span> <span class="s1">guide to remodeling costs in Houston provides a jumping-off point to get you on your way. Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One of the first steps to a renovation is creating a budget. To get an accurate number that is specific to what you want and the home you’re working with, a Sweeten contractor will want to sit down and discuss the details. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Here’s a quick overview of budgets for popular renovation projects:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Gut renovation: starting at <strong>$80 &#8211; $100</strong> per square foot (psf)<br /></span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen remodel: starting at <strong>$10,000 &#8211; $15,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: starting at <strong>$25,000 &#8211; $30,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen remodel: starting at <strong>$40,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Budget bathroom remodel: starting at <strong>$8,000 &#8211; $15,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: starting at <strong>$15,000 &#8211; $25,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">High-end bathroom remodel and expansion: starting at <strong>$30,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Deck composite: <strong>$18,000</strong> or <strong>$56</strong> psf<br /></span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Wood deck: <strong>$13,000</strong> or <strong>$40</strong> psf<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much a Houston home remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Remodeling costs for a total gut renovation in Houston starts at <strong>$80 &#8211; $100</strong> per square foot (psf) for a project that uses affordable finishes according to Houston-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6943#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Santiago</a>. This means materials such as laminate flooring and countertops, value-brand appliances, and basic tiles from big box stores like Home Depot. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #333333;">However, “the ideal gut renovation cost is about <b>$125</b> psf in order to have nice finishes but can go much higher depending on what the client is looking for,“ he said, adding that he has seen gut renovations come in at <b>$250 </b>psf. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Although a gut renovation is a big project, consider doing it all at once to get the best bang for your buck. It’s also going to get you your dream home much quicker than renovating room by room. The bigger your project, the less per square foot it will cost. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6945#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Nathan</a><span style="color: #333333;">, based in Houston, advises homeowners to look at the area around them and what renovations are costing. “Don’t put more money into your home than what is comparable to the area,” said Nathan. In other words, don’t go to the effort and cost of a high-end renovation in an area that doesn’t call for a high-end renovation. However, “if it is going to be your retirement home, then do whatever you want with it,” Nathan added.</span></span><span style="color: #333333;"><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3"> </span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46400" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png" alt="find general contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much a Houston kitchen remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>For a budget kitchen that comes with new prefab cabinets, new appliances and new flooring, expect to pay between <strong>$10,000</strong> and <strong>$15,000</strong>. Homeowners that recently had Santiago work on a kitchen remodel kept the budget low by having the original cabinets repaired and painted, a low-cost granite was used for the countertop, porcelain for the backsplash and the homeowner kept the original flooring.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5"><span class="s3">A mid-grade kitchen remodel in Houston has costs starting at <b>$25,000 &#8211; $30,000</b>. What does a mid-grade kitchen look like at this starting cost? The key is keeping your layout the same. This means replacing your oven and dishwasher without moving their location so plumbing and gas lines can stay as is. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1">You can get a stainless steel sink with single-lever faucet, laminate countertops, a built-in microwave, value-brand appliances, custom lighting, and semi-custom cabinets. An island could also be added. Moving plumbing, gas, and electrical, reconfiguring the layout, or choosing custom features will increase the budget.</span><span class="s3"><br /></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li6"><span class="s6">For a high-end kitchen, </span><span class="s7">labor costs and a refresh with select high-end materials such as marble or quartz countertops, imported backsplash tile, and high-quality fixtures start at <strong>$40,000</strong>. The costs increase from there with custom features, new cabinets and appliances, and reconfiguring the layout.</span><span class="s6"><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #333333;">Sweeten contractor Santiago is currently working on an <b>$80,000 </b>kitchen remodel. For that price, the homeowner is getting custom cabinets, a quartzite countertop (quartzite is the natural version of quartz, which is manmade), light fixtures worth <strong>$300</strong> a pop, and high-end appliances from Sub-Zero and Wolf. “One issue that pushed up the cost is that the plans were changed several times,” said Santiago, which lost buying power and time, which costs money. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48222 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Houston-RemodelingCosts-.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="760" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Houston-RemodelingCosts-.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Houston-RemodelingCosts--300x228.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Houston-RemodelingCosts--600x456.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much a Houston bathroom remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="s1">For a budget, expect a rip-and-replace bathroom with no behind-the-wall surprises to start at <strong>$8,000 &#8211; $15,000</strong>. The layout will remain the same where plumbing doesn’t move. This budget won’t include any </span><span class="s8">issues like leaks or mold discovered once the project begins</span><span class="s1"><span class="s1">. Materials will include a prefabricated vanity, ceramic tile, and fixtures from big-box stores.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1">“The key to maintaining a low budget is to shop around and apply filters when searching through websites,” said Santiago. “That way you prevent wanting an item that is not under your budget.”</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">In the Houston area, a mid-grade bathroom can start at <strong>$15,000 &#8211; $25,000</strong>. The average cost of a mid-grade bathroom remodel is about <strong>$19,000</strong> or <strong>$542</strong> psf, according to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/west-south-central/houston-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s9">report</span></a>. Like kitchens, the key to a budget in this range is sticking to the same layout. This avoids costly and time-consuming plumbing work.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">This budget is for a 35-square-foot bathroom with a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. A renovation of this level can add almost <strong>$12,000</strong> to a home’s value, <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/west-south-central/houston-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s9">recouping</span></a> close to 60 percent of the project’s cost.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li6"><span class="s6">For a high-end bathroom remodel and expansion, the cost can start at <strong>$30,000</strong>. </span><span class="s7">This budget includes a three-piece bathroom (tub/shower combo, toilet, and sink) for a typical 5’ x 7’ space. The cost increases with features including a double vanity, creating a separate shower from the tub, specialty tile, a custom vanity, or a toilet with additional functions.</span><span class="s6"><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for adding outdoor space</span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Houston is a great city for year-round outside entertaining. Crisp winter nights can be spent by the fire pit. Humid summer afternoons can be paired with a cold drink on the patio. An outdoor area is a project to really let your creative juices flow. There are endless options to make your outdoor area your own with extensive outdoor kitchens, gas fireplaces, fans and misting systems for cooling, custom lighting, and landscaping. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #333333;">“A high-end patio that we worked on recently involved building an outdoor grill station with a roof,” said Santiago, of the <b>$25,000</b> project. “The only thing that pushed up the cost was trying to find the specific brick that the client wanted.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #333333;">Nathan recently completed an outdoor patio and kitchen with a budget of<b> $50,000.</b> It had a gas range, a fridge plus another one just for wine, ambient lighting, security cameras, a pergola and an area for the client’s dogs that was covered in artificial turf.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You can also stick with something simple that has a restrained budget. A basic wooden deck will likely cost <strong>$40</strong> psf or <strong>$13,000</strong> for something in the 320 square foot range. A deck made from composite, a mix of wood product and plastic, will cost around <strong>$18,000</strong> for the same size or <strong>$56</strong> psf. This material tends to last longer with less maintenance. </span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1">Other remodeling costs in Houston: Permits</span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The cost of building permits varies from place to place. There are nine counties that make up the city of Houston. Each one has its own building permit system and fees. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For example, in <a href="https://www.eng.hctx.net/Portals/23/FC/fee-schedule-w-fmo-operation-permits.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harris County</a>, most residential renovations attract a <span class="s9">$130 fee. </span>The minimum fee in <a href="https://mcgtn.org/building-codes/fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s9">Montgomery County</span></a> is <strong>$15</strong> plus <strong>$.30</strong> per square foot of your renovating project. Depending on your remodel, there could also be a plan review fee (half the initial permit fee), a plumbing permit (<strong>$100</strong>), and a mechanical permit fee (<strong>$100</strong>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #333333;">Santiago calculates an average permit fee when doing a quote for a client. He takes the square footage of the project and multiplies it by $1 and then adds additional fixed permit costs such as plumbing, electrical or HVAC.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Enjoy making your Houston home your own.
