<p>Joanna &amp; Mark&#8217;s 1-bedroom loft in Clinton Hill was a perfect place for the couple to spread out and enjoy their work &amp; hobbies &#8211;that is, until the day they found out they&#8217;d be having a baby! With a new addition to the family on her way, the mother &amp; father-to-be needed to make <a href="/2012/12/06/site-visit-designing-for-a-bk-loft-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some changes</a> at home, including more storage options and, of course, a place for their daughter, while also keeping workspace available for Mark, a composer, multimedia artist &amp; student. So, the expecting couple posted their project to Sweeten, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors and, after meeting their matches, chose a Sweeten general contractor for their renovation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="hardwood-floors-and-white-walls"  class="wp-image-38650 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/x-large-4-560x420.jpeg" alt="living room with track lights and white walls and hardwood floors and doors after renovation" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/x-large-4.jpeg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/x-large-4-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Before renovating, the 950 sqft loft had a lot of open space, including an area for Mark to practice music and store his equipment.</p>
<p><span id="more-7500"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="planning-and-building-a-bedroom"  class="wp-image-38651 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/03_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-1-560x420.jpeg" alt="planning and building a bedroom with a curved wall corner next to living room during renovation" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/03_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-1.jpeg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/03_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-1-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />Here&#8217;s that same view right after demo of the master bedroom walls; the workers are mapping out where the new walls will go. More on the design and construction process for this project <a href="/2012/12/06/site-visit-designing-for-a-bk-loft-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="living-room-with-curved-wall-corner"  class="wp-image-38652 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CH3-560x311.jpg" alt="living room and hallway with hardwood floors and gray walls and barn door and round wall corner floor to ceiling built-in bookshelves at the end of hallway after renovation" width="560" height="311" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CH3.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CH3-300x167.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> And here&#8217;s the finished space! The master bedroom stayed in the same location but was slightly reduced in size, and the new baby&#8217;s room is entered from the opposite side, near the bookshelf. Sarah was able to include a small nook for Mark&#8217;s music setup that opens to the living room or can be closed off &amp; out of sight behind a gorgeous reclaimed barn door on sliding hardware.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-7508 mb-24 " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/05_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill.jpeg" alt="caption" width="560" height="235" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/05_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill.jpeg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/05_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-300x126.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Looking back at an interior elevation drawing of the planned space before it was built &#8211;it&#8217;s so awesome to see how the design elements translated into real life!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="living-with-large-barn-door"  class="wp-image-38653 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/06_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-560x356.jpg" alt="open living and dining with a large barn door and gray wall and hardwood floors and track lighting and large window after renovation" width="560" height="356" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/06_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/06_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-300x191.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />It&#8217;s also great that Mark &amp; Joanna did not have to sacrifice their living space, yet their new home does so much more than before!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="end-of-hallway-book-shelves"  class="wp-image-38654 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/07_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-560x1015.jpg" alt="built-in floor to ceiling book shelves at the end of hallway with hardwood floors and pendant light and gray walls after renovation" width="560" height="1015" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/07_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/07_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-166x300.jpg 166w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/07_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-497x900.jpg 497w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />Sarah designed this floor-to-ceiling bookshelf which stores the family&#8217;s book collection and highlights the high-ceilings found throughout the space. Working closely with Joanna &amp; Mark, the designer also planned a future phase of their project which includes more ceiling-high shelving and a library ladder. Phasing their project out in this way gave the couple more opportunity to work within a budget.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="hand-painted-tree-wall-mural"  class="wp-image-38655 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/08__theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-560x652.jpg" alt="hand painted tree mural on a pastel green wall and shoe molding and hardwood floors after renovation" width="560" height="652" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/08__theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/08__theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-258x300.jpg 258w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The curved wall of the baby&#8217;s room will make it such a fun space to grow into!</p>
<p>Big thanks to homeowners Joanna and Mark, and to Sarah Zames of General Assembly!</p>
