<li><strong>Primary renovation: </strong>A gut remodel of a kitchen requiring major electrical work and a suite of compact appliances</li>

<li><strong>Homeowner&#8217;s quote: </strong>&#8220;F<span class="s1">rom the start of the job to completion, we communicated constantly, and I think that’s one reason why it went so smoothly.&#8221;</span></li>

<h3>Technical needs take priority over aesthetics</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I knew from the beginning that the electrical work needed to be upgraded, and I included that important aspect of the job when I posted my project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>. </span><span class="s4">I took part in the initial consultations with contractors via Zoom, and then met the ones that interested me in person. My Sweeten contractor, who I chose to hire, is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woman-owned contracting firm</a>. She came with the electrician and gave me a better estimate</span><span class="s1">. </span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The plan was to </span><span class="s2">replace the electrical box and redistribute the power, since I’d been having constant issues when I used multiple appliances simultaneously. We would also </span><span class="s1">improve the lighting by installing new fixtures and switches.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">A plumber assessed that the old pipes and a plumbing line</span><span class="s1"> would need to be replaced before putting in a new sink and faucet. Those fixes would be particularly essential since I wanted to install a dishwasher for the first time.</span></p>

<h4>A 180-degree kitchen remodel</h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Of course, I felt most excited about the things that were visible. I hoped to find a source for small, good-quality small-sized appliances. I wanted to use Ikea cabinets and replace the countertops and backsplash. We would redo the kitchen top to bottom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from refinishing the walls</a> and soffits to putting down a new floor.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This was not my first renovation, but my first time doing a major teardown and remodel. I had a lot of questions about the cabinets and having enough storage space, in addition to the technical updates. My Sweeten contractor helped so much during the planning phase. I asked a lot of questions before we started. She provided great suggestions.</span></p>
<h3>Spotlight on compact appliances for small spaces</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The renovation was straightforward: No walls were moved and no layout changes were made. </span><span class="s1">I had an initial design in mind but because of the extra money I spent on electrical and plumbing upgrades, I had to change it and cut materials</span><span class="s2"> costs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50276 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen with brass fixtures and open shelving" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With this in mind, my biggest choices were the appliances and the cabinets. It was a challenge finding reasonably priced and attractive compact appliances—when you’re looking for 18-, 20- or 24-inch models, choices are limited. I found the dishwasher, but t</span><span class="s4">he hood took a long time. I didn&#8217;t want one that stuck out, and anything less than 24 inches seemed nonexistent. When I found this 20-inch model, I ordered it right away—but then it came and we had no idea how to make it ductless! Note to apartment dwellers: A ductless hood, or one that can be adapted with a kit, is what you need. </span><span class="s1">By the time I found these items, I’d <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to go with custom cabinets</a>, to make life easier and maximize space.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">I had an initial design in mind but because of the extra money I spent on electrical and plumbing upgrades, I had to change it and cut materials</span><span class="s2"> costs.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h4>A unique blend of color and pattern</h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition, with custom cabinets, I had an opportunity to be creative with color.</span> <span class="s6">Initially, I’d envisioned light-gray cabinets with wood flooring. Then I changed my mind and</span><span class="s1"> looked at patterned vinyl flooring; in the end, I decided to </span><span class="s6">totally</span><span class="s1"> contrast it to the wood floor in the living area</span><span class="s6">. Looking at it with paint chips, a paint color called Brittany Blue—a light gray-blue with a warm-gray undertone—looked best for the cabinets.</span><span class="s1"> The color wasn’t far from what I had imagined, and it was a really good decision.</span> <span class="s1">I wanted a gold tone as an accent color, so I chose brass handles for the doors and drawers.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When it came to the island, I got even bolder. I purchased it online and when it came, I didn&#8217;t like the color, so I decided to experiment. I’d seen a photo of a kitchen that had purple cabinets. I remembered it because that color choice was so unusual and didn&#8217;t look dated. Painting that island was a fun project.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I chose quartz for the countertops and wanted to continue with the same material for the backsplash. For a small kitchen, it made a lot of sense, especially in terms of budget, since it didn’t cost anything extra to install.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50281 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-09.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated kitchen with eat-in nook" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50277 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated kitchen with quartz countertop and microwave storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">For the lighting, I was less involved than I expected to be. </span><span class="s1">I wanted overall lighting and also a fixture above the dining table. My contractor and electrician suggested installing LED lights above the cabinets, which turned out to be my favorite aspect of the renovation. The lights are dimmable, and such an upgrade from just a single ceiling fixture.</span></p>
<h3>Good communication—the key to a successful remodel</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">Throughout the process, I was so happy to have my Sweeten contractor’s input.</span><span class="s1"> When something on my list cost too much, she always came up with an alternative solution that worked just as well. Also, from the start of the job to completion, we communicated constantly, and I think that’s one reason why it went so smoothly.</span> <span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten also stayed in touch</a> and helped with project flow by checking in periodically. There weren’t any issues, but I liked knowing I had a fallback in case something went wrong. I think I worried less throughout the renovation as a result.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The project worked out so well that it’s hard to list just one thing I love about it. I am truly pleased with the new kitchen’s flow, and the look of the whole room tops even what I had hoped it could be. I am really happy with the result.</span></p>

<h3>From Renting to Buying</h3>
<p>I’ve always had a passion for real estate. I even work in real estate tech as a product manager. Since moving to the city over 10 years ago, I’ve spent my fair share of time looking at listings of apartments for sale. After many years in tiny Manhattan studios (think 300 square feet), it was time to get serious about buying an apartment.</p>

<p>I started to hunt for Manhattan apartments (with a preference for downtown) that were both affordable and true one-bedrooms. I spent around nine months going to open houses on Sundays, and after seeing many apartments, I finally stumbled upon the space I ended up buying in Chelsea.</p>
<p>It might have been how quiet and calm the apartment felt, but it was exactly what I was looking for. It is a true one-bedroom in a prewar building and has much of its original charm: a sunken living room and beautiful arches. But the original kitchen was the size of a closet. I used the fact that it was outdated as negotiating leverage and was able to bring the purchase price significantly below asking (a rarity in Manhattan).</p>

<h3>Deciding Who to Hire</h3>
<p>After asking around, I realized that finding a general contractor to do work in a Manhattan co-op was no easy task. I stumbled upon Sweeten, and after <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27395" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting my job</a> there, I connected with a few general contractors. I didn’t go the architect route because it would have added to my budget on top of the renovation materials. Also, I wasn&#8217;t <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planning any significant structural change</a>s. For a one-bedroom renovation, that extra cost is just enough to push the cost over the return. Without an architect, however, finding a detail-oriented general contractor who is on top of their game was paramount. That’s exactly what I found with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3275#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Sweeten contractor I chose</a>.</p>

<h3>Must-Have: An Oven to Fit a Turkey</h3>
<p>The biggest part of the remodel was gutting my tiny kitchen. I hired a kitchen designer to help me optimize the layout. She came up with configurations I couldn’t imagine possible in a 70-square-foot space. As an avid cook, I had a few (okay, maybe slightly crazy) requirements: a full size 30” stove, a large refrigerator, and a dishwasher. I was told the most I’d fit into the space was a 24” stove, but my heart was set on fitting a large turkey into my oven. And after much finagling, we found a layout that allowed for everything I wanted and more (somehow, I even fit a wine fridge).</p>

My Sweeten contractor worked closely with me to come up with a solution: a combination of <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/kitchen-cabinets/buying-guide/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom and standard cabinets</a>. We spent two hours talking through cabinet door sizes as well as placement so that the doors were symmetrical and made sense for the space. (Trust me, this guy pays a lot of attention to detail.) For my peninsula, he took the lead on creating both a practical layout and aesthetically pleasing geometric shape. There needed to be enough room to pass when walking into the apartment (the front door is right near the kitchen).</p>

<h3>A Refresh for the Apartment</h3>
<p>Beyond the kitchen, the remainder of the renovation was giving the apartment a facelift. I refinished the floors, stripped the door frames down to their original steel, replaced the baseboards, changed the grout in the bathroom, added a closet in the bedroom, and put a nice layer of paint on all of the walls.</p>
<h3>Delivery Saga</h3>
<p>While much of the kitchen renovation was a fun process, I’d be lying if I said there weren’t bumps along the way. Most of my friends do not believe me when I tell them I bought six sinks for the kitchen. Yep, you read that right: six sinks. To make a long story short: there was a farmhouse sink that was too shallow (thankfully, my contractor pointed this out to me), one that fell off a truck during delivery, another that arrived and didn&#8217;t fit, another that arrived then got lost (and eventually found again), and two others that ended up getting returned. When the sink saga was over, my boyfriend told me he never wanted to talk about another sink again. And honestly, who could blame him?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I ended up with a beautifully renovated home that stayed true to its prewar nature. A common question I was asked after completing my renovation was: Would I do it all over again? You betcha.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Kayla and Jesse, for sharing your refreshed home!</em></p>

The room was closed off to the rest of the living spaces. The renovation plan was to keep the square footage the same so as to not disturb any architectural details with expansion. However, breaking through the wall for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/a-kitchen-pass-through-gets-social-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass-through breakfast bar</a> was the solution to open the space up to the living room.

Although she admits, “I’m in the process of creating a “bucket list” installation for the remaining wall, though I’m enjoying the space the empty wall creates.” With only the width of a range to work in, this layout presents an efficient way to navigate this space.</span></p><h3>Open shelves in a galley kitchen look stylishly neat</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21171 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Daniel, a food writer and former chef, installed <span class="s2">open shelving</span></span><span class="s3"> instead of upper cabinets along half of the wall in the kitchen.

They instead used that extra space to take advantage of the room’s length and install lower cabinets all the way to the window wall. To make it feel even bigger, they opted for one long wood shelf opposite the wall of upper cabinets.</span></p><h3>Clever idea: shallow cabinets save space</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37242 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Inwood kitchen renovation, remodel, after, design, construction" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandra and Michael overhauled their </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/sustainable-remodel-inwood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing galley kitchen layout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to add more cabinet and counter space.

They relocated it to a spot a few feet outside of the kitchen walls. A cutout in the wall at the entrance also helped free up space. Pro tip: if you’re unsure about taking down walls, moving your refrigerator can be an alternative to free up space while preserving the existing layout.</p><h3>A galley kitchen puts dead space to use</h3><p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="galley kitchen with blue walls and granite countertops" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-28402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten homeowner Rashmi had no interest in an open kitchen when it was time to renovate.

To save space, shallower 18” kitchen cabinets were installed on one side. Closer to the entry, a narrow eat-in bar that was an extension from the countertop in the kitchen fit two stools. Opposite the bar, Rashmi installed built-in cabinets for storage and a washer and dryer.

First, using built-in refrigerators and dishwashers–which are only 24 inches deep–creates a seamless, flush line between appliances and cabinets. This eliminates protruding handles or edges. Second, choose your color palette wisely. Light-colored cabinets, like white, gray, and agave, make small spaces look bigger, as do glossy, reflective surfaces. Third, talk to a contractor about adding a pass-through window. These open up the space and allow for guests to mingle while the hosts prepare food. Lastly, look at the overall placement of your cabinets and appliances. Move bulky items, like fridges, away from the kitchen entrance as these can create visual barriers to the space and make it look smaller.</p></div>

			<h2>Smart layouts and storage solutions make small spaces work</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is, not everyone (especially apartment dwellers) has a large kitchen with an eat-in island and endless cabinets. What we’ve discovered, is that it’s not the size that really matters, but how homeowners and their <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractors maximize the space given. Check out these five <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small kitchen remodels</a>, all 60 square feet—or 10’ x 6’ as a comparable measurement—and under, that demonstrate the functionality of smaller kitchens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Treanna_Kitchen-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26844 size-full" title="small kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Treanna_Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="small galley kitchen with white cabinets " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Treanna_Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Treanna_Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Treanna_Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
The previous owners of Treanna’s home didn’t realize the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/small-60s-kitchen-gets-star-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42-square-foot kitchen’s full potential</a>. With cabinets left to a single wall and the refrigerator alone on another, it was clear there was a better way to maximize the footprint. Along with her Sweeten contractor, they came up with a design featuring cabinets on both sides, full-sized appliances, and plenty of storage (including a toe-kick drawer and a hidden fold-up stool).</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37558 size-full" title="small kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07.jpg" alt="Brooklyn, New York City, renovation, remodel, kitchen, wood cabinets" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37559 size-full" title="peg board storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08.jpg" alt="Brooklyn, New York City, renovation, remodel, kitchen, utensil storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Clever organization (and some extra square footage in the entryway) made working </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/44-square-foot-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">within 44 square feet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> possible in Sunghee and Joseph’s cook space. They relocated the refrigerator to a storage wall just outside the kitchen and focused on smart storage solutions, like the pegboard panel on the outside of a narrow pantry cabinet. It also doubles as a drying rack and permanent hanging spot. The couple’s architect suggested separating the cooktop and oven so cooking and baking could be done simultaneously, without the couple stepping over one another.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21436 size-full" title="small kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="small kitchen with black cabinets and backsplash" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Architects Kate and Arthur took on a multi-room renovation, including </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanding and changing the layout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of their roughly 48-square-foot kitchen to add a few more feet. The space went from a single wall to a much more ideal L-shaped layout that allows for storage and cooking room. Not to mention, they could add a full-height refrigerator and an 18-inch dishwasher. They managed to do it all while retaining all the original plumbing locations—meaning no added <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expense to the budget</a> due to rerouting or permits to file—a total win-win! </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36151 size-full" title="white-cabinets-and-yellow-walls" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with white countertop and yellow wall and undermount stainless steel sink with brushed nickel pull down faucet and herringbone backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measuring in at just 55 square feet, Racquel’s kitchen wasn’t just small, it was also </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kensington-brooklyn-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stuck in the ‘60s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She couldn’t change much about the size itself, but all new fixtures and appliances were more than enough to transform the space. The white gloss cabinetry and the stainless steel appliances reflect light from the window, which lightens the room and helps it feel larger too. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34316 size-full" title="small kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="small kitchen with white and black tile " width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-06-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marc and Steve’s kitchen was already open to the living and dining space, which automatically made the </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-white-kitchen-sized-just-right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60-square-foot area</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look bigger. They installed a patterned black and white floor that adds personality, along with all-white Ikea cabinets to keep it clean and simple. The window over the sink (the perfect placement!) was widened to let me more light in.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Here’s a primer on kitchen cabinets, from custom designs to stock options</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinet construction may well end up being the&nbsp;single biggest expense of your entire renovation, and the results are the most obvious visual proof of your investment, so this can feel like a heavy decision. The challenge (and opportunity) is that your choices are endless, but if you focus on a few key factors, you can find the right cabinets for your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20751 mb-24 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="487" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br>
IKEA cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Matthew&#8217;s kitchen renovation</a>.</p>
<p>While it’s tempting to assume that your budget is the only consideration and while it’s true that custom cabinets can be (much, much) more expensive than stock cabinets, they don’t have to be.&nbsp;Even the cheapest kitchen is an enormous investment, so if budget isn’t necessarily the deciding factor, how should you decide and how can you keep your budget from dictating your choices? First, a few definitions.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color=""></a></p>
<h2>Should you go with custom or pre-fabricated cabinets?</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stock cabinets</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA</a>&nbsp;is widely considered the go-to for stock cabinets. Unlike almost anyone else, they mass-produce a system of set sizes, colors, finishes, and features that you pick and choose. The pieces of your order are pulled from stock supplies and shipped to your home, where you need to handle both the assembly and installation. IKEA keeps its costs low because they are sending your order to you in pieces and because the materials they use are very inexpensive.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pre-fabricated cabinets</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lowes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lowe’s</a>,&nbsp;and other big-box national retailers are distributors of independent lines of cabinets. They offer a semi-custom option: like IKEA, you pick and choose from set sizes, colors, finishes, and features (though national retailers tend to have more options overall). Unlike IKEA, your order is then manufactured and assembled for you so that your cabinets arrive ready for installation. Because you have more choice in materials and construction, the range of prices varies more here. You will probably pay more upfront for higher-quality materials, but you may spend less on labor because the cabinets are assembled before they get to you for installation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Custom cabinets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets are designed and constructed by hand based on your individual design. You define the sizes, materials, finishes, and features and your order is hand-crafted and delivered for installation.&nbsp;Because your choices for materials and construction are endless, the range of material and labor costs is very wide. The costs here are generally distributed between your choice of material and style, labor, and a more personalized design and customer service approach.</p>
<h3><strong>High-end, built-to-order cabinet systems</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A small group of cabinet companies also offer cabinetry systems that are extremely high-end (<a href="https://bulthaup.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulthaup</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.henrybuilt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henrybuilt</a>&nbsp;are examples). These companies are known for beautiful and durable cabinet construction and best-in-industry warranties, but the bare minimum for even&nbsp;a small kitchen can easily exceed <strong>$20,000</strong>, so unlike other categories of cabinet construction, this option is only available if the starting point for your budget allows you to consider it.</p>

Custom cabinets by Henrybuilt in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kavi and David&#8217;s kitchen</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets might be less expensive than you think if your kitchen has limited space, lots of space, or an unusual layout.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a tight kitchen, stock and pre-fabricated cabinets in standard sizes might not be worth the initial material savings because you will need more inventive labor to fit everything in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a large kitchen, extra depth or high ceilings give you an opportunity for additional storage and functionality. Non-standard cabinet heights and depths can bring value to your renovation and re-sale value. Multiple corners, awkward niches, and unusual footprints can be&nbsp;tough to outfit. Stock and pre-fab cabinets in standard sizes may force you to spend money on filler materials, wasted space, and labor for semi-custom adjustments.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“If you have a kitchen with corners or small spaces or an awkward layout, you may not actually save money on the total because you end up paying for filler materials and extra work to pull everything together.” &#8211;&nbsp;Sweeten contractors</i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-24618 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-723x1087.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel cost" width="723" height="1087" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-723x1087.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br>
<span style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets in </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-woodwork-manhattan-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric&#8217;s kitchen</a><span style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;designed and built by his </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a><span style="text-align: justify;">.</span></p>
<h3>Custom cabinets might be worth extra money if you plan to stay for years, have kids or a high-traffic kitchen, or want personalized support.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Semi-custom and custom cabinets offer higher&nbsp;quality materials in sturdier thicknesses that last longer.&nbsp;Particle board and MDF, two common materials for stock cabinets, are susceptible to water and have a shorter life span than plywood and wood. 1/2” particle board will not last as long as 3/4” or 1” furniture-grade plywood cabinet bases, and solid wood doors and drawers will endure tougher handling over the years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets also typically use sturdier construction and joinery methods. Custom cabinetmakers will often use dovetail joints that interlock pieces of wood to distribute weight and stress more evenly, whereas stock nut, bolt, and nail methods isolate wear on a few points. They also offer options for tougher hardware elements like hinges and drawer sliders. In addition, custom cabinet makers generally provide a higher level of design support and customer assistance. They will do site visits, re-designs, and get a real person on the phone with you when you need it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You might be absolutely fine to handle the ordering and delivery of a stock system, but if you hit a roadblock, custom cabinet companies expect to support you and respond personally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Once you order the IKEA materials and you pay for assembly and installation, you’re not far off from a custom option that would last longer and provide more options – for a few extra thousand dollars, you may actually get a much better deal.&nbsp;Each time you take one of these steps up in material quality and thickness, you have a corresponding price and life span increase.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Alan<br>

IKEA cabinets with custom doors by Semihandmade in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/becky-kitchen-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Becky and Sarah&#8217;s kitchen</a>.</p>
<h3>Cost aside, pre-fabricated cabinets might work best for you if your renovation timeline is speedy or you feel overwhelmed by choice.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets have lengthier lead times. If you’re gearing up for a renovation in the next two months, you can get your hands on pre-fab cabinets in-store on a same-day basis, or delivered within two or three weeks. And, a perceived weakness of pre-fabricated cabinets is actually a real strength: for many homeowners, unlimited choice is not necessarily desirable. Many homeowners go with custom cabinets because they think they want options and then end up feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed. Pre-fabricated cabinets offer a pick-and-choose experience that requires less homework and decision fatigue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Many clients ask us what styles we offer and it can be hard to explain that it can be anything they imagine. Shops like ours provide personalized&nbsp;design as part of the overall service to build features for individual clients.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a></i></p>
<h3>Still having trouble deciding? Go for a&nbsp;hybrid!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Combining a pre-fab kitchen with custom pieces can lower your cost without compromising on quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Combining a pre-fab kitchen with custom pieces allows for lower cost and uniqueness. Companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.semihandmade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semihandmade</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://kokeena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kokeena</a>&nbsp;make door and drawer faces for stock cabinets so you’re not limited to IKEA’s palette. In addition, there are endless options for shelving, countertops, and cabinet pulls&nbsp;allowing for individuality while using inexpensive pre-fab cabinets.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Lauren and Adam</a></i></p>

For more modern kitchens, a matte-finish knob or pull is an easy way to customize cabinets. Repainting with a calming neutral or a bold jewel tone can refresh a kitchen without requiring demolition.</p> </div> </div>
