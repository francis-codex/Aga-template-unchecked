</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Michele</i></span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Getting excited to renovate</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I lead a digital product design team for a large San Francisco-based company. I’ve lived in this apartment for a little over a decade, and I had been meaning to renovate my bathroom since I moved in, but I always found a reason not to. The bath hadn’t had an upgrade since the building’s 1980s conversion to co-op! The pedestal sink wasn’t fully attached to the wall, the tub tiles were loosening, and the glass tile floor, which a previous owner had painted, was flaking.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">My apartment is on the top floor of a 1910s five-story building, and it suffered damage during a co-op-sponsored roof renovation a couple of years back. When the building’s contractor completed the repairs, I got excited about renovating. My recently acquired work-from-home job gave me more incentive. I’d updated my home office to suit the remote role, but experiencing my out-of-date bathroom all day, every day, prompted me to get planning.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Finding inspiration from other renovators</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I spent so much time on Sweeten, reading this blog, and looking at other people’s projects! It was a tremendous help seeing what other people had done. </span><span class="s5">I had strong ideas about how I wanted to proceed, but I needed help turning them into particular products, finishes, and colors.</span> <span class="s1">Sweeten provided me with a range of contractors and design-build firms who gave me numerous options. I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5415#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose my Sweeten contractor</a> because his ideas matched mine.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I’d done advance planning for the bathroom and had a clear idea of what I wanted: a floating vanity, a drop-in tub, oversized subway tile, and dramatic tile flooring. I was attracted to images of gray kitchens and bathrooms with boldly patterned floors. I envisioned something that was calm and streamlined, to make the space feel bigger and take advantage of the high ceiling. My apartment is modern and open. I wanted the bath and kitchen to feel integrated, rather than set apart from the rest of the space.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47057" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03.jpg" alt="pattern tile bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">The contractors were great at explaining problems long-distance: I’ll never forget the crew piling on a conference call about my formerly crooked bathroom wall&#8230;</span></p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A new dishwasher becomes a full kitchen remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, my plan had been to simply install a new dishwasher. Then it was suggested that a pantry could be added in the then-unused space at the kitchen’s entrance. The original kitchen plan I had posted to Sweeten was of a smaller scope, but after meeting them, I asked the contractors to submit follow-up <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bids for a full kitchen remodel</a>.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-47056 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, I worked with my contractor to come up with a plan. I put together the light and dark gray cabinets with chrome handles and found a quartz countertop flecked with both colors. I picked the same flooring that the designer had used in their showroom.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01.jpg" alt="open shelving kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-47055 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05.jpg" alt="blue kitchen cabinetry" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-47059 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Transforming the bathroom wasn’t so hard. I saw a tile floor I liked in the sale listing of another apartment in my building and tracked it down. Finding a bathtub that would fit the small space was a challenge, but we did. (The white tub looked yellow next to the tile, so we had it reglazed.) Because of pipes in the wall, we couldn’t create storage niches in the shower, so the team extended the interior windowsill with a white quartz surface material—a shampoo perch. The floating sink is mounted a bit higher than standard because I’m tall.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A timely business trip</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The project’s biggest challenge was also something of a stroke of luck: My boss asked me to travel from New York to San Francisco, starting the day demolition began. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I stayed for almost three weeks</a>. While I was away, the Sweeten construction team kept me posted and sent pictures daily. The contractor was great at explaining problems long-distance: I’ll never forget the crew piling on a conference call about my formerly crooked bathroom wall while I waited outside an executive office at work!</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Instead of hiring a project manager, I worked as my own. I had spreadsheets for how much had been spent versus budgeted. I tracked what had been ordered, shipped, and delivered. I’m not that organized, but I turned into a full-on spreadsheet ninja. It kept me from panicking.</span></p>
<div><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-47060 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></div>
<h3 class="p5">Finishing the bathroom and kitchen renovation during COVID-19</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">By the time COVID-19 hit and the lockdown was ordered, we were 95 percent done. We had to wait for the lockdown to lift and for my building to let the crew return, clearly articulating when they would arrive, and wearing masks as required.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Eventually, we finished. After expanding my renovation’s scope, I spent significantly more than I originally intended to—close to $100,000 all told, but that includes fully updated plumbing and new floors in both rooms. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I have enough storage space in the kitchen and bathroom that nothing falls out when I open a cabinet! I love cooking; I’ve got a lot of ingredients and equipment, and it’s so nice not to feel like I’m overstuffing every corner. Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment! I’m also enjoying the dishwasher. I love the way the kitchen tile feels under my feet, and how the rooms are designed for me, with my interests and needs—even my career—in mind. That customization is the greatest luxury of the whole thing.</span></p>

			<h2>Combining two apartments is never easy. See how these families combined spaces.</h2>
<p>Combining two apartments into one home is one of the most time-consuming (and rewarding!) projects in the renovation world. The reason behind the decision varies, but the need is usually the same&#8230; more space. These renovators approached us looking to find vetted <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractors who could <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">merge apartment units</a> to fit their changing lifestyles. Learn more from these NYC apartment combination examples below.</p>

<h3>1. Building a peaceful city oasis</h3>
<p>When this homeowner’s search for a three-bedroom apartment ended in disappointment, he decided to go in another direction. He bought two apartments in an Upper West Side co-op building after consulting the building’s management and an architect, with <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-apartment-combination-with-a-view/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a plan to combine them</a>. Both units were located at the end of a hallway.</p>
<p>Working with his architect and the Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor</a> he hired, he decided to merge them together through their kitchens and replace them with an open kitchen. He also expanded the primary bedroom and bathroom, creating a mini spa with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk-in shower</a>.</p>
<p>A few bumps came up during the project; converting the bathtub into a walk-in shower required raising the floor underneath for the drain pipes in order to meet code and when trying to designate an entryway, they realized the configuration just wasn’t working. He ended up buying additional square footage from the hallway to create a more inviting one. Construction took a total of six months of work. The time, effort, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation costs</a> were well worth it. The homeowner said the apartment, “feels like living in a peaceful oasis above the city.”</p>

<h3>2. Up against a wall</h3>
<p>Zoe had long dreamt of buying and combining apartments, so when she and her husband Arvid felt they had officially <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outgrown their 700-square-foot one-bedroom</a> in Lincoln Square, Manhattan, they took matters into their own hands. After sending letters to neighbors, they learned one was looking to move, and the couple bought their apartment.</p>
<p>The goal was to remove the two existing kitchens and replace them with a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern cook space</a>, plus rip out floors, and create a third bedroom. They learned knocking down walls certainly doesn’t come without challenges. Their contractor came across an unmovable gas riser in a wall they had planned to take down to open up the dining area. Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor assessed the options</a> and had a solution: Make it part of the architecture by designing a partition (pictured above) and creating a dining nook. “Our contractor carefully installed the panel and adjusted the baseboard to make a seamless connection. This graphic panel is now a nice focal point that adds a lot of character,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36557 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg" alt="Combining two apartments gave this couple a spacious kitchen a room to grow their family in the city" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label">(Above) Megan and Zak&#8217;s apartment combination in Manhattan</span></p>
<h3>3. Building one modern, family home</h3>
<p>When Megan and Zak bought a one-bedroom apartment in Carnegie Hill, Manhattan, they hoped the space would work for them and maybe a baby down the line. A year after living in their space, not only did they <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/carnegie-hill-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">realize it needed to be renovated</a>, but also that the apartment really wasn’t big enough for another human (even a tiny one). Luck was on their side as an apartment next door was available.</p>
<p>Once they finalized the sale, the couple started planning to combine the two apartments into one modern, family home. The biggest changes in the overall floorplan included eliminating one kitchen and converting a living room into a primary bathroom. The rest of the renovation focused on <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating an open concept kitchen</a> and living area.</p>
<p>While they did run into a few issues (like discovering pipes in a wall that needed to be rerouted), overall their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation experience went smoothly</a>. “Keeping our eye on the end goal—creating a home we love for us and our baby—made it all worth it. There’s a story and memory behind every material and decision we made. We feel so lucky to live in a space we created for our family,” Megan shared.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-MarieNiarchos-During.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37901 mb-0 size-chrono" title="under construction" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-MarieNiarchos-During-723x482.jpg" alt="nyc alteration agreement " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-MarieNiarchos-During-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-MarieNiarchos-During-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-MarieNiarchos-During-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-MarieNiarchos-During-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-MarieNiarchos-During.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>Chances are, if you’re renovating in an apartment building—whether it’s a co-op or a condo—you’ll know what an NYC alteration agreement is. And if you don’t, read on! It’s one of the many factors that will determine whether your renovation vision can come to life.</p>
<p>Alteration agreements recognize the reality of urban living: your neighbors are just a wall, ceiling, or floor away. What you choose to do in your renovation will affect their apartments and their lives over the duration of your project. This document prioritizes the greater good of the building over your desire for a new kitchen configuration. However, it doesn’t mean that you can’t get that new layout. The document is there to give consideration to your fellow residents. We offer this outline as the jumping-off point for your renovation’s building approval process.</p>
<h3>What is usually included in an alteration agreement?</h3>
<h4>Scope of work</h4>
<p>The document will request a scope of work from your architect or general contractor. This, along with submitted plans, will be reviewed by the board and its architect. They may have questions for you. Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors in NYC are <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experts in managing this board approval process</a>.</p>
<h4>Insurance</h4>
<p>The agreement will ask you to provide the proper paperwork from your contractor and any subcontractors working on the project. Pay attention to the level of insurance required. In New York City, buildings typically require $1 to $2 million of coverage. Some buildings, however, require upwards of $5 million. Sweeten architect Jiwoo points out, “If your building requires this level of insurance, the pool of general contractors available to you automatically shrinks. Most contractors do not carry this level of insurance, so you’re really looking for experts who specialize in luxury buildings.”</p>
<h4>Timeline</h4>
<p>Boards like to maintain the quality of life for other building residents over the course of your remodel. One way is by restricting the hours of the day that a renovation is permitted. Usually, there cannot be loud noises prior to 10 a.m. or after 4 p.m. Sometimes the work is reserved for only certain months of the year. For example, Jiwoo tells us that in some apartments on Central Park West, homeowners are only permitted to do renovation work in the summers.</p>
<p>Alteration agreements may include information on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how long your project</a> can take. If the deadline is exceeded, sometimes a penalty fee is imposed. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor Santiago</a> shares that while many alteration agreements include this penalty, boards are often willing to extend the date or to provide a grace period.</p>
<p>Other agreements may dictate that only a certain number of renovations can be ongoing at any given time. As a result, you may have to plan your date and wait for your neighbors to complete their projects before you can begin yours.</p>
<h4>Wet-over-dry rule</h4>
<p>This is another key element to look for in an alteration agreement. If you&#8217;re planning to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">move your bathroom</a> or <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expand your kitchen</a> into spaces previously designated as bedrooms or living rooms, you may run into challenges. Buildings often want to keep all the “wet” rooms in a vertical stack due to the possibility of leaks. However, your architect can work with the board to explain how precautions will be taken to limit the possibility of leaks or noise from these rooms that might be disruptive to neighbors.</p>
<h3>Is it worth submitting plans that request something that is expressly prohibited in the alteration agreement?</h3>
<p>The document provides the ground rules for your renovation. That said, it depends on the character of your board and the management company. Open a discussion on a reasonable point if you think that the agreement is outdated or does not reflect current practice. Examples could be the enforcement of the wet-over-dry rule or the prohibiting of a new HVAC system. The first person to ask is the property manager—if that person says no, it’s not worth wasting your time.</p>
<p>The building board of one <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-remodel-on-the-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner on the Upper West Side</a> prohibited central air from being installed. With tenacity and support from her renovation team, she was the first homeowner to have the HVAC system in her home.</p>
<h3>What if there is no alteration agreement?</h3>
<p>If your building does not have an alteration agreement, it does not mean that you are free to take a no-holds-barred approach to your renovation. This means that the approvals process will be dictated entirely by the composition of the board and its preferences. Smaller buildings might not have this document and these approvals processes tend to be very hands-on. This scenario may play out in the renovator’s favor, however, given that these small buildings can also be more open to your vision.</p>
<h3>Important things to remember</h3>
<p>Sweeten contractor Santiago reminds us of the purpose of alteration agreements: “The main thing is that the board wants to protect itself. Second, it wants to protect the other shareholders.”</p>
<p>But you should take the document with a grain of salt. “It only gives you so much insight. It’s a formal document, but the truth of the matter is only revealed when you jump into the process,” explains Sweeten architect Jiwoo. “Ultimately, the alteration agreement tells you very little about what the review process is like. It’s not until you get comments back from your board’s engineer or architect that you will really discover what is off-limits and what is permitted.”</p>
<p>Use your alteration agreement as a guide, but <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with an experienced NYC general contractor</a> and architect to help you navigate both the agreement and the co-op board. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find the remodeling experts</a> with the right experience and you&#8217;ll be on your way to demolition and a reimagined space.</p>

<h3>Why the right general contractor is important</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating can be a complicated process. However, the more you know about working with a general contractor, the better prepared you’ll be. While these professionals execute the labor of your renovation, they are also a collaborator to your dream home. Their team will be working in your space for several months. Because of this, you really want to be confident in knowing how to hire a contractor<span>—the right one for <em>your</em> project</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten outlines the process—from what to look for, to the key responsibilities you can expect from your general contractor.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Do you need a general contractor or a handyman?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first step to starting your project is figuring out the scope of your renovation. Depending on the level of labor your project requires, you will either need a general contractor or a handyman (or DIY!). To decipher the difference, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are you hanging things on walls, or taking down walls?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are you re-grouting tiles, or replacing them?</li>
<li>Smaller projects to make repairs or patch-over errors are handyman-ready. On the other hand, large-scale projects that involve electric or plumbing will require a permit or inspection. In this case, a contractor with a state Home Improvement Contractor (HIC) license will be obligatory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining labor for your renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For first-time renovators, figuring out what kind of labor is required for the project can be hard to determine. If you live in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-op</a> or condo, your alteration agreement may provide guidelines when hiring a general contractor. In other situations, checking your city’s Department of Buildings will offer information on the types of projects that require a permit. <strong>The most important thing to remember is that cutting corners with unlicensed workers is never worth the risk. </strong>It often leads to homeowners needing to pay extra to fix unfinished, subpar, or non-permitted work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doing the research to determine if you need the services of a general contractor is a crucial step in getting your project off the ground. Then the next step is finding the best contractor for your job.</p>
<h3 class="p1">How to hire a contractor suited to your project</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the process of interviewing and hiring a general contractor, start by looking for someone with experience in your neighborhood and who has done similar work. This can help you narrow down the field from thousands of general contractors to just a handful of experienced professionals. Keep these questions in mind as you search:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Has the contractor done work in your neighborhood?</li>
<li>Has the contractor done similar work to what you’re looking to get done?</li>
<li>Can the contractor provide quality references and photos of past work?</li>
<li>Is the contractor licensed? (Working with an unlicensed contractor isn’t worth the risk!)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask to see some of their past projects in person or to speak to their past clients—at least two. General contractors in Sweeten&#8217;s network have completed transformational renovations with past clients who are still happy with the work years later. This indicates that the contractor&#8217;s work has held up over time. <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten matches homeowners</a> to a selection of contractors based on location, budget, scope, and style for the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you&#8217;ve found someone you think would be a good fit for your project, take it one step further and make sure they’re a good fit for you. You’ll be working with this contractor for the duration of your project, so you should feel compatible! Here&#8217;s what to look for:</p>
<h4>Are they communicative?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you can trust your contractor to be responsive throughout the entire renovation process. Both parties will need to be on the same page, especially in terms of timeline.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is it a good fit personality and style-wise?</h4>
<ul>
<li>First impressions do matter! The contractor should be able to understand and carry out your particular sense of style. Additionally, with the amount of time they’ll be spending in your home, look for someone who meshes with your personality.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Do they have recent and reliable references?</h4>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s important<span style="color: #333333;"> to review </span>recent references for similar projects that your contractor has completed. You should be aware of the level of satisfaction of past clients. At Sweeten, our contractors have profiles that highlight past projects and client reviews to help you decide.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What does a general contractor do?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your general contractor manages your project from start to finish, focusing on the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Obtain proper licensing, insurance, and additional documents required by city, state, and specific to building needs</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Review site conditions and all relevant documents and drawings in order to fully understand the project and generate a proposal and bid (the proposal is the plan and the bid is the proposed cost)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Specify the final scope of work, and schedule, and come up with a contract</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Define the payment and deliverables schedules</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Request and follow advice from the architects, engineers, or design team</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Manage and coordinate general aspects of a project, like site requirements</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Provide skilled labor, tools, equipment, and various services</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Coordinate subcontractors and other trades required by the scope of work and oversee the quality of their work</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Maintain schedule and communication with clients</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Review project completion with the client and final payment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asking general contractors for estimates (at least 3)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A contractor will partner with you to decide on:</p>
<ol>
<li>The final scope of work</li>
<li>Materials</li>
<li>Timeline</li>
<li>The best form of communication, and how often they should check in with you</li>
<li>Budget and payment schedule (make sure you have everything in writing)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sweeten recommends getting 3-5 estimates from contractors to see where the price range falls. This also allows you to experience the different personalities and communication styles of the contractors. Who do you have the best rapport with? Who do you feel the most comfortable with? These factors will play a big part in your decision when hiring a general contractor.</p>
<h3>Understanding estimates from general contractors</h3>
<p>Bid leveling is a crucial step that will allow you to break down and compare the services the contractor can offer at each price point. This occurs once you have received estimates, or bids, from contractors.</p>
<p>For example, one contractor who gives a higher-priced bid may provide more individual services, like answering questions on the weekend or putting a mood board together for you. A comparative breakdown of the bids will reveal a clearer picture of what services you want as a renovator.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Outdated units merge into a family home in Manhattan</h2>
<p><i>Megan and Zack thought a one-bedroom apartment would be sufficient space for them—and maybe a child down the line—when they purchased their home in a 1928 co-op building in Carnegie Hill, Manhattan. A year of living in the space, however, changed their perspective. The good news? Luck was on their side, as a one-bedroom next door became available. They set out to combine the two apartments and </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20885"><i>posted their project on Sweeten</i></a><em>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors. </em><i>With their contractor by their side, they reimagined a home fit for them and (spoiler alert!) their little one.</i></p>

<i>Guest post by homeowner Megan</i></p>
<p>When Zack and I came across a one-bedroom in a prewar co-op building in the Carnegie Hill neighborhood of Manhattan, I convinced him we could “Marie Kondo” our lives and one day raise a child in the minimalist 600 square feet. As we went through the process of buying the apartment, sharing our entire financial histories, tax returns, and hopes and dreams for the future with each other (and the bank and co-op board), we began to affectionately call each other tenants-in-common.</p>
<p>The first time we entered our new apartment after closing, Zack proposed in the living room. Months later at City Hall, we discovered that it’s easier to get a marriage license than a mortgage.</p>
<p>A year into living in our new place, it became clear the apartment was in dire need of a renovation, and space would be tight if we ever had a child—even if we committed to the life-changing magic of tidying up. When we discovered the one-bedroom apartment next to ours was available, our “it’s so crazy, it just might work” plan to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combine the two units</a> went into action, and we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20885" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project on Sweeten</a>. Before finding Sweeten, the sketchiness factor of finding a contractor was a bit high for our comfort. In contrast, Sweeten’s process felt legitimate and professional. We were impressed with the three contractors we matched with and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose this general contractor</a>.</p>

<p>Our original apartment had only one street-facing window, a single light in each room, and was very dark. Plus, it had bold wallpaper and flashy light fixtures that just weren’t our taste. The second one we bought hadn’t been touched in decades. Combining both of them would allow us to rethink the space to suit our needs and lifestyle. The new layout and recessed lighting allowed us to brighten up the space.</p>
<p>We made one kitchen bigger and eliminated the other to create a living room, and the former living room became our master bedroom. Our old bedroom became a nursery, although we called it a “guest bedroom” for the first few months so future grandparents wouldn’t get their hopes and expectations up. I found out I was pregnant about four months into the renovation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we wanted a clean, modern, and bright space. I grew up in a house with white walls and dreamed of the day I would have my own place with HGTV-inspired fun accent walls and bold colors. Yet somehow we ended up with white walls, which probably means I’m turning into my parents. The best money we spent was on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproof windows and soundproof walls.</a> We used to be able to hear everything happening outside on the street, and the lack of noise transformed the space. Now, when we’re eavesdropping on people’s conversations outside, it’s on purpose.</p>

<p>The kitchen is beyond our wildest dreams of anything we ever expected to have in New York City. We wanted it to be completely uncluttered, so we built spaces in the cabinets for the microwave, dishwasher, and trash. The gigantic kitchen sink brings me joy on a daily basis. Originally, we were thinking a medium-sized sink, but our contractor pushed us to consider something bigger, and we’re glad we did. The sink has all sorts of inserts—a cutting board, colander, tub, drying racks, and Murphy bed (just kidding about the last one) so it becomes any type of prep-surface we need.</p>

<p>We took advantage of an awkward corner to install a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/banquettes-seating-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in breakfast nook</a>. It’s become our go-to place for eating meals and working. Plus, it’s a natural gathering place and a cozy use of an oddly-shaped space. For the pantry, we used an Elfa system to create a miniature sewing room with a designated desk and outlet in there for my sewing machine.</p>

<p>The ice and water dispenser on the door of our refrigerator also has an outsized impact on our daily lives. After wasting years of our precious youth waiting for water to drip through a Brita filter, it feels like a miracle to have ice and cold water tumble effortlessly into a glass.</p>

<p>Both bathrooms stayed in place, though the one in the original apartment became our master bathroom adjacent to our new bedroom. My parents are updating their own house to be “aging-in-place” so we decided to put a walk-in shower instead of a tub in the guest bath, and used door levers instead of knobs throughout the apartment. We also installed hand showers in both spaces.</p>
<p>An image on Pinterest inspired the walls of hexagon tiles in our guest bathroom.  I loved how the classic shape was being used in an unexpected way. As someone who hates to scrub grout, using dark tile and gray grout in the shower seemed like a win-win for laziness and classiness.</p>

<p>In our new master bedroom (formerly our original living room), we wanted to maximize the minimal natural light. I read that light colors can make a dim room seem smaller, so we decided to paint the walls and ceilings a rich navy. That, combined with the blackout shades, makes for a very cozy sleeping environment. Along with the kitchen lights, the master bedroom lighting is voice-controlled. Having smart lights started out as a novelty, but became so useful once we had a baby to carry around. We may not have a flying car, but lying in bed and telling a robot to turn off the bedroom lights is our version of living in the future.</p>

<p>Our former bedroom is now the guest room and nursery. The neutral color palette, mixed with fun prints on the walls, makes it the perfect space for both. An architect friend suggested barn doors for the office to let more natural light into the whole apartment too.</p>
<p>We’ve watched enough home improvement shows to know that the unexpected is to be expected. Sure enough, we discovered pipes in a wall that needed to be re-routed and had to change our plans for the guest bathroom toilet when we found a floor beam in the way of our plumbing. With each surprise, our contractor kept us updated and came up with workable solutions. He was very upfront about what our options were and what the changes to our original scope of work would cost.</p>
<p>Our Sweeten contractor has a really good eye for design, and anytime we were in doubt about a decision, we followed his advice. From the soundproof windows and tile selections to the kitchen counters and a square toilet (surprisingly comfortable!), he never steered us wrong. We also appreciated how our contractor kept us updated; he set up a WhatsApp group chat which allowed us to easily communicate throughout the whole project, and we had weekly meetings face-to-face.</p>
<p>Having started this project as a couple and finishing it with a baby in tow, we can say that it’s faster (and cheaper) to create a human life than to renovate an apartment. That said, keeping our eye on the end goal—creating a home we love for us and our baby—made it all worth it. There is a story and memory behind every material and decision we made. We feel so lucky to live in a space we created for our family.</p>
<p><em>We hope you love your new home, Megan and Zack!</em></p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Welcome to #9 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p><em>Feel free to email me at <strong><a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a></strong> with any reno questions or dilemmas you&#8217;d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>What is an alteration agreement?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>If you live in a co-op or condo building in New York City, you&#8217;ll have an alteration agreement. In the document, your board lays out all of the rules and guidelines for renovating in your building to ensure there is minimum disruption to your neighbors while a renovation is in progress. This can include rules on the allowable work hours (to limit noise) and when the freight elevator will be open for deliveries or materials. When you&#8217;re buying, or if you&#8217;re thinking about renovating in a co-op or condo, you should read your alteration agreement immediately before talking to a general contractor; you&#8217;ll need to share those guidelines right from the start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another important piece of information usually found in the agreement is how much insurance your building requires. This amount is usually from $1 million to $3 million, which you&#8217;ll want to relay to any contractors you&#8217;re speaking with in order to make sure that they have that coverage in place before they even step foot inside your home. If you <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project on Sweeten</a> and include this amount in your profile, Sweeten will make sure to only match you to contractors who can cover the requirement.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovate and open up a kitchen in a Ditmas Park, Brooklyn co-op</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Lindsay, a director at Brooks Brothers, and Roger, a director in pre-sales at StyleLabs, purchased their 1,075-square-foot, two-bedroom co-op in 2016. Roger “loves to play around in the kitchen,” said his wife, Lindsay. While the kitchen was dark, outdated, and not very functional, the space also didn&#8217;t offer a clear sight line between the kitchen and living room. “We wanted a more family-friendly space, opened up so whoever was in the kitchen could interact with family and friends in the living room,&#8221; they said. &#8220;And we wanted some kind of island/breakfast bar.” After living in the co-op for about a year, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and planned a renewed flow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32796 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-1-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Lindsay was about nine months pregnant during the renovation, something she wouldn’t recommend to anyone doing a remodel. “The challenge of trying to get around the apartment that was in complete disrepair was interesting on some days,” she said. “We ended up moving the entire kitchen and living room into the nursery. I’d recommend going on a vacation or taking a long weekend trip during the major part of the construction. You think you can live through it for a week or two, and then realize how long a week or two really is. It would have been a nice break to go somewhere where there wasn’t dust and tools and boxes everywhere.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32801 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Their Sweeten contractor</a> “knew we wanted to get everything done in time for the baby to come<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>with a little bit of time to spare to clean up the nursery,” Lindsay said. “They were good at communicating what the status was, how long something was going to take, and how much time we had to make a decision.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33272 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-3-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Before-3" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-32806" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen07-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN LindsayConnolly Kitchen07" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The job was basically a “rip-and-replace” with a new peninsula where the wall between the kitchen and living space once stood. The only appliance that moved was the refrigerator, which stayed on the same wall. For the cabinets, their contractor recommended <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a kitchen designer in the Sweeten network</a>. The kitchen designers provided the initial custom cabinet layout, then Lindsay visualized the usability of the kitchen. “I mapped all of our stuff from pantry and appliances to a drawer or cabinet. Then I was able to work with our contractor to determine the best shelf or drawer configuration to utilize the space and fit our stuff,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32807 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen08-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen13.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32812 mb-0 size-chrono" title="light-brown-cabinets-white-quartz-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen13.gif" alt="light brown wooden cabinets and white quartz counter and gray walls after renovation " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The duo chose an island/breakfast bar so guests would feel like a part of the cooking process. Tall cabinets like the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry</a> gave them more storage with pull-out drawers for easy access and a large drawer for their spices. A separate small counter and shelves stand in as their “coffee bar.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aside from the difficulties of being pregnant and having to move things during the renovation, Lindsay felt it would have been easier had they spent more time deciding on appliances in advance and budgeting in the little things like cabinet hardware, lighting, faucet, and sink. “You’ve got to be flexible and open-minded to extending your timeline if something is not available immediately, or finding a substitute material.” She also would have raised her <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost expectations</a> another $5,000 to $10,000. “There’s always something you forget or didn’t know you had to pay for, like licensing fees just to get co-op approval.” (See Bonus section below.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32797 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-2-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32803 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen04-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32810 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen11-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lindsay cautions other first-timers to be prepared to pay a fee to show a copy of a license for plumbers and electricians, a fee for an engineer to review the design, and a fee for the management company and/or board to review and approve. There were several back-and-forth discussions to get the paperwork exactly right for the approval. “It took us six to eight weeks to get everything in order and get the final approvals,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the bumps, Lindsay and Roger—and now Porter, born in January just after the project was finished—are delighted to be able to entertain family and friends from their new, open kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32800 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen01-1-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The couple had actually posted this project on Sweeten twice. There were “politics,” Lindsay said, in getting it approved through the co-op. “We thought we could just submit the design and it would be approved,” she said. “The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">approval process</a> for our co-op board was multi-level, which we didn’t understand when we first posted.”</p>
<p>They removed their posting and Sweeten’s client services helped Lindsay rewrite it and narrow down the choices while they searched for a contractor match. Once they found a potential match, several other factors were required by the board, and their contractors “took the time to go through the copy of the board requirements before we officially selected them,” Lindsay said. “As a first-time renovator and co-op owner, we were happy to have a little guidance from someone who has been through this process before.” <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Kasey set out to find a prewar apartment of his own and discovered original herringbone wood floors to take center stage</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26030 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As someone who works for a real estate investment company, Kasey has an innate appreciation for New York City’s grand architectural history. So it was no surprise when he purchased a prewar apartment along Park Avenue within the Murray Hill Historic District, which boasts landmarks such as JP Morgan’s mansion and the Union League Club. “When I moved to New York, I was fascinated by the prewar architecture,” he said. “It makes New York real estate what it is.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26029 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26031 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_foyer-e1502742377528.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26296 mb-0 size-chrono" title="foyer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_foyer-723x461.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During his search, he specifically set his sights on a prewar building with original oak herringbone floors. Even though the space he was considering appeared to be stripped of any ornate details, Kasey had seen other apartments in the building with the original patterned wood floors. He suspected—and hoped—that underneath the carpeting of what could potentially be his home, he might find the same wooden floors that he could <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinish</a> to their original condition. On his final inspection before closing, he lifted up a corner piece of the sad floor covering, and sure enough, herringbone wood floors in near perfect condition peered back. It remains one of his favorite aspects of the prewar apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That discovery was the beginning of a rather long process. Initially, Kasey planned to renovate in stages, starting with a kitchen makeover along with unveiling, sanding, and refinishing the floors. It quickly became clear that doing the whole apartment, including expanding a dressing closet into a small bedroom and renovating the bathroom, would best be accomplished all at once. The building’s co-op board, known for being strict, took six months to approve Kasey’s purchase. He anticipated that gaining their approval for the renovation would also take months and he only wanted to go through that process once. When he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5048" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project on Sweeten</a>, his matchmaker helped find a contractor who had experience navigating co-op boards. From those he interviewed (including non-Sweeten contractors), he ultimately chose a Sweeten team because of their knowledge working with tough boards and their track record renovating similar prewar apartments. “They came with the experience of what is allowed in a prewar building and what isn’t,” he said. Other historic building details included cement walls throughout the home, which made demolition an involved process but ended up benefiting as sound insulation from neighboring units.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As the board waded through his renovation plans—it ended up taking four months to approve, the same amount of time as the entire renovation—Kasey rarely <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stayed</a> in the apartment. “It was in such bad shape,” he said. He opted for hotels and couches of generous friends. The studio was an estate sale and it looked like it. A boxy kitchen, cheap and tired cabinets, a grimy bathroom and carpeted floors throughout made for a dreary atmosphere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kasey’s aesthetic goal with the renovation was “to be mindful of the prewar nature and reflect the traditional design of the building and block.” For the clunky kitchen with a cramped layout, he basically started fresh. “I wanted to open it up and make it seem as large as possible,” he said. He got rid of the wall that separated kitchen and living room; not only did this merge the two spaces, it allowed the small window in the kitchen space to spill light into the living room. That is also why he envisioned a mostly-white kitchen—to reflect more light into the living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26040 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26037 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though Kasey doesn’t cook much, he specifically wanted a Bertazzoni range after noticing its distinct and refined design during a trip to Italy and felt it fit well with the understated classic style of his kitchen. The range threatened to delay the project when the wrong model was delivered, but Kasey&#8217;s Sweeten contractors quickly replaced it with the correct model. He also wanted a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen island</a> that ended up morphing into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peninsula</a>. “It actually comes into the living room and overlaps with the wood floor to combine the two spaces,” he explained.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26051 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-During-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26050 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26052 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26057 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="1085" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-26724" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/L2A2378-as-Smart-Object-1-723x482.jpg" alt="_L2A2378 as Smart Object-1" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, he let his Sweeten contractor, a design/build firm, guide his design choice that would best suit a building from the 1940s like his. After sifting through 100-plus subway tiles that differed in color, gloss, and size, Kasey felt a white gloss subway tile was the classic way to go. Delicate hexagonal marble tiles on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor</a> and a light marble on the sink provide an understated detail. “There are no windows, so I was trying to use light shades of paint and reflective tiles to brighten it up as much as possible,” he said. Kasey’s Sweeten contractor encouraged him to keep the bathroom layout the same to avoid unnecessary permits from the Department of Buildings. He contemplated a walk-in glass shower but eventually went with a tub for resale purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were practical things to consider, such as storage lost when the dressing room turned into a small bedroom. While a door leading into a private elevator entrance was no longer in use, it helped provide space for a closet. It also remained a nice historical detail in the prewar apartment. Kasey also used furniture as a repository for more items—a living room coffee table doubles as storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While Kasey loves his new renovation—the classic look, the bright space, and those herringbone wood floors—he has a new appreciation for the involved process of renovating in Manhattan. However, he learned one important lesson. “It is much more rewarding to live in an apartment that you spent a bunch of time renovating,” he said. “It feels a lot more like it’s yours.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Turn an old, run-down bathroom into something elegant and calming</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Mary Ann and Frank’s three-bedroom Upper West Side apartment had done its job since they had bought it in 1992.  But now, with their two kids grown and gone, the couple pulled the trigger on a long-planned master bathroom upgrade. “Our co-op building was built in 1929 and it was the bath from 1929<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></i>same tub, same tiles,” said Mary Ann, who works in publishing. Grime on the tiles wouldn’t budge and some tiles were no longer there at all. Paint peeled off the walls and with no vanity, shampoo bottles were always on prime display. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: To keep the costs down, the couple kept the original layout. But that was all they kept. What they wanted was a stylish sanctuary beginning with a hex tile bathroom. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hexagons were laid on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble</a> topped off the vanity for a refined look. The shower also has matching marble tiles. Their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> suggested painting, not tiling, the wall opposite the shower and vanity. Rather than feeling enclosed, the bathroom now feels “more like a room,” said Mary Ann, “and plus it would have been a lot of cleaning.” They did lose storage space in their master and hall bathroom, which they also renovated. However, a large vanity and two large mirrors with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> built into the wall that were added to the master bathroom made up for that. When you open each mirror, there is also another magnifying mirror. The vanity has six large drawers and two cabinets for storing toilet paper and cleaning supplies. &#8220;We were just going for a more calmer, less cluttered look,” said Mary Ann. “Now, everything is put away.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Mary Ann’s centerpiece is a walk-in shower so large “you can do yoga in it.” The old tub was decommissioned and replaced with a walk-in shower with glass walls. “It’s so much fun to take a shower now,” said Mary Ann.  </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a renovation buff like the rest of us at Sweeten, you might be dreaming of buying (and of course, renovating) your own piece of real estate. A crucial step in turning that dream into reality? Securing a mortgage. Here&#8217;s the lowdown:</span></p>
<h3>Qualifying standards</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First-time homebuyers are often overwhelmed by the process and the sheer volume of paperwork involved, but finding a reliable mortgage professional to walk you through the process is key. Even before you shop around for experts, however, you should have a sense of your own finances. This means knowing that you know the answers to the following questions:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have a good (preferably over 700) or great credit score (typically 800 and above)?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much money do you have in the bank?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much monthly debt do you have compared to your monthly income?  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answers to these questions will give you an idea of how easily you’ll be able to get the mortgage you want. The best candidates have a good credit score, money in the bank (for a healthy down payment of at least 20 percent*), a strong salary (to pay the monthly costs), and an acceptable level of debt, explained further below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortgage bankers work with different formulas to determine the home loan amount that you qualify for, and different lenders will use varying standards. Two of the most significant, however, are the payment-to-income ratio (“housing expense ratio”), and the debt-to-income ratio (or “debt service ratio”).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Housing Expense Ratio</b></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: On a conventional Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac loan, the monthly mortgage payment (including the principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) cannot exceed a certain percent of your income (usually around 28 percent). So for example, if your gross income is $4,000 a month, your house payments cannot amount to more than $1,120 a month. There are exceptions: for loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA-insured loans”), the percentage allowed is higher, whereas loans guaranteed by the Department of Veteran Affairs (“VA-guaranteed loans”) do not consider the payment-to-income ratio at all but instead look at residual income. </span><span class="s1">[Total Income x 28% = Total Housing Expenses | EXAMPLE: $4,000 x 28% = $1,120]</span><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Debt Service Ratio</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: With a conventional home loan, your recurring debt total cannot exceed a certain percent of your monthly income (usually around 36 percent). This includes your housing payments (determined above). So continuing with the example above, if you make $4,000 a month, you are allowed a total monthly debt of $1,440. Subtracting your mortgage payment, that gives you $320 to pay all of your other recurring debts, including any student loans, credit cards, car payments, etc. As with the housing expense ratio, special loans have more forgiving percentages. On an FHA-insured loan, your debt cannot exceed 43 percent of your monthly income, whereas, on a VA-guaranteed loan, your debt cannot exceed 41 percent of your monthly stable income. </span><span class="s1">[Total Income x 36% = Total Monthly Debt Allowed | EXAMPLE: $4,000 x 36% = 1,440]</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mortgage101.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25092 mb-0 size-chrono" title="mortgage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mortgage101-723x325.jpg" alt="mortgage" width="723" height="325" /></a></p>
<h3>Getting pre-qualified or pre-approved</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a competitive market like New York City, it’s important to start the mortgage process even before you start looking at homes. It’s generally expected that, if financing is required in your home purchase, a pre-qualification or pre-approval letter accompanies the offer. So what does it mean?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Pre-qualification</b></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be considered “pre-approval-lite”—it is usually provided after you have a quick chat with your lender about your big-picture finances. They don’t do an in-depth analysis or a credit check but can give you an estimate of the amount that you’d qualify for. A pre-qualification can take as little as 30 minutes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Pre-approval</b></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is more complex and requires you to supply the lender with documentation of your income and debt (rather than just providing it verbally, as with pre-qualification). This includes W-2s, tax returns, bank statements, paystubs, and more. (Get organized now! This information is much easier to gather if it’s not all in an unsorted pile under your bed.) It also involves an extensive check into your finances and credit. At the end, you receive a conditional commitment for the exact amount they are willing to loan you in a pre-approval letter. This letter strengthens any offer because it assures the seller that you can very likely obtain the actual funding. A pre-approval will usually take at least a whole business day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If at all possible, get a pre-approval: “Most pre-qualification letters are not worth the paper they are written on, because nothing has been verified. With a pre-approval, credit, assets, and income are verified, allowing the lender to approve you for a home loan based on what you qualify for,” explains Romuald Solages, a mortgage loan officer at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.phsloans.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerHouse Solutions</a>, a direct lender for mortgages to the consumer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span class="s1">In competitive markets, such as NYC, getting a pre-approval places you in a stronger position should you find yourself in a bidding war. It will take a little longer but it’s part of the process if you are serious about buying property with a mortgage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this means that you should speak with a mortgage broker or banker </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">prior</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to going to that open house (easier said than done, we know.) This process gives you an accurate estimate of how much house you can afford, based on how much you have for a down payment, as well as your financial history. Plus, once you’ve done this, you’ve drastically simplified the steps needed to take once you have an accepted offer since the lender will already have much of the information required for your application. You may need to update the info if a lot of time has passed, but you won’t be starting from scratch.</span></p>
<h3>Where to find a mortgage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have to stick to your current bank for a mortgage. &#8220;Many people falsely assume that they will fare much better with their mortgage if they just use their established bank, the one they already do their banking with,&#8221; says Romuald. While many banks do advertise programs for their customers,  he adds, &#8220;it’s always best to shop around.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">There are the national lenders, like Wells Fargo and Chase, but also reputable local companies like FM Loans and Freedom Mortgage. Keep in mind you are working with specific loan officers/bankers and not just an institution, and as with attorneys and agents, many people use personal references such as friends and family. Your real estate agent should be the first place you go to for suggestions if you have no contacts. Other sources include a mortgage banker or a mortgage broker—the latter are much less common after the financial crisis. The former works directly for a lender (e.g., a bank), where your loan originates, whereas the broker is a middleman, who shops around for you and connects you to a lender.</span></p>
<h3>What if…</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">*You don’t have 20 percent to put down</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? While that amount is recommended in today’s market, most conventional lenders will allow you to put down as little as 10 percent (unless you are applying for a special program, such as the FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed loans). With 10 percent down, however, you will still be required to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI), which you can avoid by putting down at least 20 percent. FHA loans, which require a down payment of just 3.5 percent, are a good option for those who don’t have a lot of cash in the bank.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">*You don’t have good credit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, FHA loans may be the answer here. Because the FHA insures the home loans, they lower the risk for the lender, allowing them to be more lenient with both the size of the down payment as well as the borrower’s credit score. The minimum FHA loan credit score is 580, which means that the borrower would qualify for maximum financing under their standards with a down payment of just 3.5 percent. If your credit score is lower than 580, you can still qualify, but will be required to put down 10 percent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s important to examine your credit reports carefully because any mistakes on your credit report could lead to a higher mortgage rate or even loan rejection. Checking your credit report with all three major credit bureaus—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—is free through annualcreditreport.com,” says Romuald. </span></p>
<h3>Buying and renovating all-in-one loan</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in buying to renovate, consider applying for one loan to cover both. This simplifies the process by allowing you to do just one financing application, with only one set of closing costs. The lender will calculate how much of a mortgage you’ll qualify for based on the future value of the property, so you’ll be able to obtain a larger amount than if it was based on the current value. There is in this case also an FHA option, known as an </span><a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/203k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FHA 203(k) loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Last year, Lindsay and Tim bought their first home together<i>—</i>a sprawling two-bedroom apartment on Central Park West. The couple—a medical student and financial analyst, respectively—saw the potential to create an incredible home for themselves, but had a list of renovation items to tackle first. With Sweeten&#8217;s help, they created a classic but thoroughly contemporary apartment with room to grow. By updating their existing kitchen and baths, they carved out new spaces for living, working, and entertaining. Read on for how they reconfigured walls to add an expanded office, a half bath, </i><em>AND bonus storage space </em><i>to their prewar apartment! </i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23151 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Upper West Side homeowner Tim Laurie</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After purchasing our first apartment together in June of 2016, my wife, Lindsay, and I decided to take on a co-op renovation in order to make it our perfect living space. We were attracted to the location and design of the 1929 Art Deco building on Central Park West, but the interior of the apartment left a lot to be desired. The 1,500-square-foot home offered a very spacious feel, with nine-foot ceilings and light coming through windows on three sides of the apartment. The layout, however, was dated and not very efficient. The “before” layout consisted of a cramped corner kitchen, large but divided living and dining spaces both of which had duplicate doorways on both sides, old en-suite bathrooms, and a dark walk-in closet converted to a cavernous office space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23304 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Before-and-After-Floorplans.001-720x540.jpeg" alt="Before and After Floorplans.001" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23305 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Before-and-After-Floorplans.002-720x540.jpeg" alt="Before and After Floorplans.002" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When planning the new layout, first and foremost, our renovation needed to address the practical features that were lacking. Specifically, we wanted: 1) a toilet that didn&#8217;t require guests to venture on an embarrassing trek through a bedroom in order to get to an en-suite bathroom; 2) more usable space, such as a den or optional third bedroom; 3) a washer and dryer in the apartment; and 4) a larger, but not galley-like, kitchen. With the help of Sweeten, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/10047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> and went with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contractor</a> that stood out as most reliable, reassuring, and within our cost estimate. We initially interviewed five contractors for our project, and received three quotes. Our contractor was not the least nor the most expensive, but he offered to include the finishing touches on our apartment to ensure we got the most out of our renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23378 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Manhattan renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-2-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23154 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23156 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23157 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest change in the kitchen was changing the entrance from a narrow doorway to a wide foyer and pass-through, allowing us to add a bar area, more counter space, and plenty of light. Our contractor helped us with the kitchen layout and where to place the washer/dryer so it connected to our water lines. We went with stainless steel Frigidaire appliances, adding a separate bar fridge under the counter to make up for a shallower built-in refrigerator that we chose. A stainless backsplash tile with white grout and slate gray floor tiles contrasts well with the white custom cabinets and brushed nickel handles throughout. We love the custom wine rack, glass cupboard, and bar shelf on one side of what used to be a duplicate doorway. A powder room—formerly small storage space—was also installed off the kitchen with double half doors, to take up less clearance space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23158 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23159 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of design, we wished to open up the main space by removing the mirrored french doors and a wall blocking the light between the living and dining rooms. For a modernized look, our plan included staining the hardwood floors, painting and papering the walls, and adding crown and floor molding. <span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">living room</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we removed the non-functional decorative plaster fireplace and the walls between the living and dining rooms to open up the main living space. A large dining room table from Pottery Barn (which nearly didn&#8217;t fit up the elevator) and chandelier sit between the bar and new office door. In this same area, we were able to build a third bedroom/den with french glass doors for light to shine through.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23160 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-01" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23161 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-02" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23306 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Upper West Side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-2-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-02" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23163 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-04" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23164 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-05" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our en-suite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bathrooms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned out beautifully, with our master bath getting floor-to-ceiling tile in the shower and on the feature wall, as well as a custom-built vanity and top-mounted sink. The white, tan, and natural sand colors flow nicely into the main bedroom, which also got repainted. The guest en-suite bathroom is filled with clean white subway tiles and Carrara marble flooring, as well as an ebony vanity with matching Carrara countertop. Although the renovation progressed well from our standpoint, the contractors had their work cut out for them! They had to cut back old bathroom tiling and build new walls. We also had to replace old bathroom plumbing within the concrete deck floors, which was unexpected, but handled well by the subcontractors that our Sweeten contractor hired.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23307 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-15-723x1084.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-15" width="723" height="1084" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23308 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-16-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-16" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slightly expanded but cozy and carpeted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">office</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a bonus room for studying and work, accessible through the new matching french doors off the dining room, rather than from the bedroom hallway. The office neatly fits our double desk and two chairs, as well as a bookshelf. A new transom window in the hallway allows more light to shine through. </span>We were especially excited about a tweed Edinburgh gray wallpaper that we chose for the entrance foyer, which makes a big statement right when you enter the apartment. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least is the updated &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">garage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; where we leave the bikes, storage, and our cat&#8217;s litter box. This storage room was coated with a fresh coat of white paint and new gray tile as well, giving it a clean look despite its utilitarian purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Overall, we are very pleased with the renovation of our Central Park West co-op apartment. At the end, we decided to add extras along the way, which extended the project time frame by several weeks and stretched our budget slightly; however, our contractor did his best to complete these while not adding labor to the total bill. He was detail-oriented and very patient, despite a lengthy co-op approval process.</span><span class="s2"> The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team kept the work to a reasonable time frame of just over three months and were very understanding as we lived through the process.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Ever since Billy &amp; Sally came to us with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/527" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their cramped Clinton Hill kitchen</a> last year, we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time Sweetening homes in the Clinton Hill co-ops. One of the most remarkable things about these projects is that they all start with the exact same, 1940&#8217;s bones, but by the end, no two of these spaces ends up anything alike. I personally cannot decide which of these kitchens I love most, but one thing is for sure, they have all come a very long way! Have a look at these three renovation outcomes and let us know which you like best.</p>
