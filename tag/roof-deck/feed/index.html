			<h2 class="p1">From kitchens and outdoor spaces to flex rooms, Chicago home design trends point to customization, utility, and eye-grabbing accents</h2>
<p class="p2"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="tiny-breakfast-nook-green-wallpaper" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50583 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_unpatterned-built-in-banquette-mudroom-feature.jpg" alt="tiny breakfast nook with round table and chairs and green wallpaper after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_unpatterned-built-in-banquette-mudroom-feature.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_unpatterned-built-in-banquette-mudroom-feature-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_unpatterned-built-in-banquette-mudroom-feature-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Chicago design project by Carly Moeller.

<p>Like homeowners nationally, those in Chicago are looking to remodel their homes to do more and with style.</p>
<p>When tackling remodeling projects, they’re going beyond what’s new. They’re considering exactly what they want, prioritizing to meet the budget. The overriding themes: comfort, convenience, cleanliness, and wellness.</p>
<p>With the help of interior designers, <a href="http://www.unpatterned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carly Moeller of Unpatterned</a>, and <a href="https://inspiredinteriors.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emily Mackie of Inspired Interior</a>, both based in Chicago, we explore Chicago home design trends to watch.</p>
<h3>What Chicagoans want in a home renovation</h3>
<p class="p2">Spaces topping remodeling lists in Chicago haven’t changed much—kitchen, bath, and outdoor. But the ingredients and wish lists have. In addition, there is a new desire for multitasking areas. Some actually point to a move away from open-concept plans to spaces with more definition. Still, the open kitchen/family room is a winning combination.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="white-living-gray-wall-panelling" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50585 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors.jpg" alt="white living room with gray wall panelling and long windows after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above) Design project by Emily Mackie in Chicago. Photos by Michael Alan Kaskel</em></span>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whole house renovations</a>—gutting as well as <a href="https://chicago.curbed.com/2020/2/28/21152809/adu-chicago-legalization-coach-house-granny-flat-affordable-housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding on or building up</a>—are still on track. Perhaps even more popular is reconfiguring an existing footprint. It’s a creative challenge that’s also <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2020-home-renovation-costs-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost-effective</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Chicago homeowners are less inclined to go to cookie-cutter plans. Instead, they’re opting for customization, making remodeled spaces their own. Making sustainable materials choices also is more intentional.</p>
<p class="p2">“Remodeling is a little less restrictive,” said designer Carly Moeller. “It’s not about ‘Is this OK for resale?” It’s about how I want it. Am I happy when I walk in? Making it your own.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">Kitchens increase function and style</h3>
<h4>Cabinetry and appliances</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Kitchen cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frameless styles convey clean lines</a>, with modern hardware or without. Move away from the extra carvings and moldings. Look for a shift from neutral—especially all white. Most liked: hues from soothing, livable shades like blue-green, blues, and greens.</li>
<li class="p2">Islands are changing shape and size.  &#8220;Stepping down&#8221; creates multiple levels of countertop for different functions. Longer, narrower islands also are a different look. Some cantilever over a perpendicular “table.” Others house storage on one end, while open space to pull up chairs is on the other.</li>
<li class="p2">Induction cooktops are gaining fans. The method cooks food more quickly and is more energy-efficient. Plus French chefs have given them a seal of approval.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p2">Countertops and fixtures</h4>
<ul>
<li>Quartz is the new stone. Porcelain slabs also offer an alternative. Color, pattern, with dramatic veining spice up a range of looks beyond white marble. Both boast antibacterial properties and are easier to clean.</li>
<li>Tile backsplashes are making a splash with texture, tone-on-tone patterns, and geometric shapes.</li>
<li class="p2">So does statement lighting. Hanging pendants in multiples, ramped-up scale, and large horizontal fixtures lend importance. Organic shapes add appeal.</li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s2">Metal finishes for faucets and hardware add sophistication and modernity. Burnished gold and matte black are popular.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Whole-home features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Smart Home tech connects smartphones with more activities in the home. Security, lighting, window shades, refrigerator thermostats, and range features (with cameras that monitor contents and cooking)</li>
<li class="p2">Ceilings are becoming a focal point. Wood beams, beadboard (painted or natural wood), and even wallpaper train our eyes upwards.</li>
<li class="p2">Wide plank wood flooring still is in vogue. However, very wide (12 inches) boards are less common than 5—7 inches.  “We’re definitely using a lot of lighter finishes,” said Emily Mackie. “Limewashed looks.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">A place for everything: Storage in the spotlight</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Pantries are top of the wish list. Organization is essential. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walk-in pantries</a> are preferred if there’s room. Otherwise, pantry “cupboards” or pullouts feature cubbies for everything from spices to canned and packaged goods. “Homeowners want to be more creative about how they use space,” said Carly.</li>
<li class="p2">Prep kitchens—High-end designers find that clients like to separate prep from presentation and entertaining. The design includes a butler&#8217;s pantry-type of space or “second kitchen” that keeps the mess out of sight.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" title="bar-area-black-cabinets" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50584 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors.jpg" alt="bar area with black cabinets and black leather chairs and long panelled glass windows after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><em><span class="img-label">(Above) Design project by Emily Mackie in Chicago. Photos by Dustin Halleck Photography.</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Breakfast bars, bars, other built-ins—Organization drives these dedicated spaces. Equipment, accessories and cups, glasses, etc. all are within easy reach. “I did an a.m./p.m. cafe,” said Emily. “We took a portion of the kitchen and made it a mini coffee bar by day and a wine bar by night.”</li>
<li class="p2">Mudrooms—Some designers predict the demise of mudrooms. Still, the need for a place to contain outerwear, footwear, and sporting equipment isn’t going away soon. “I don’t have a mudroom at my house,” said Emily. “But I have a dedicated closet space.”</li>
<li class="p2">Look for more hybrid spaces. For a couple with three children, Carly was asked to design storage space that would feel seamless, as it spilled into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modest-sized kitchen</a> and family room. Her solution: three lockers, one for each child, bench to one side with storage inside. For symmetry, there’s a table with a bench and chairs on the other side of the cabinets. She painted the wall and lockers bright blue.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">Baths focus on refreshing body and mind</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Freestanding, shapely tubs are as much of a dramatic focus as they fill a need to chill out. The spa aesthetic is a target. Air tubs take over whirlpools while soaking tubs are most popular. “I’ve been doing a lot more soaking tubs,” said Emily.</li>
<li class="p2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roomy showers</a> still favor rain effects and multiple showerheads. Even better is built-in sound.</li>
<li class="p2">Bidet toilets or toilet seats—Hygiene is a huge driver;  plus, you don’t have to worry about running out of toilet paper.</li>
<li class="p2">Slab installations are gaining ground, especially with lighter-weight materials like porcelain. The seamless, groutless look gets a huge nod of approval.</li>
<li class="p2">Some storage ideas borrow from the kitchen. Emily created a bubble bath bar with a display rack for bath oils, crystals, and salts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">Outdoor rooms are at-home getaways</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Compartmentalizing the landscape makes it flow from the indoors. Following interior cues, the goal is to create <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/renovate-an-outdoor-space-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spaces for sitting, lounging</a>, entertaining, cooking, and dining. All in a green context, with plantings of trees, shrubs, and flowers.</li>
<li class="p2">Roof decks, usually on the top of the garage are a solution for shrinking yard space. This requires adequate structure to hold furnishings, kitchens, and landscaping, with built-in irrigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" title="rooftop-deck-gray-table" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50586 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors.jpg" alt="deck on rooftop with gray table and chairs and teak tile floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;">(Above) Design project by Emily Mackie in Chicago. Photos by Dustin Halleck Photography.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Outdoor kitchens feature built-in grills, refrigerators, sinks, and specialty equipment like kegerators to dispense draft beer. In the Midwest, pizza ovens are often part of the design. Chicago at-home chefs even use them in the winter—they just shovel a path.</li>
<li class="p2">Freestanding heaters and built-in fireplaces extend the season. A range of firepit styles offers additional options.</li>
<li class="p2">Water features like ponds or small containers with waterfalls add a vacation vibe.</li>
<li class="p2">Entertainment includes outdoor-safe TVs and screens for movie-watching. “People are trying to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find ways to escape</a>,” said Emily. “When the home becomes the office, where do you go? Where there used to be square footage with a singular purpose, now I feel it’s a.m. and p.m.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">Chicago home office goes beyond Zoom</h3>
<p class="p2">The home office has re-emerged, whether standalone or integrated into the kitchen or family rooms. Flex work styles are more plentiful. So homeowners are thinking again about WFH spaces—even dedicated ones. Converting extra bedrooms or a spot in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/basement/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement</a> offer options besides integrating into kitchen/family rooms.</p>
<p class="p2">“Basement offices have become hodgepodge rooms,” said Carly. “One client needed flex space for kids to work, so we did three built-in desks with shelving.”</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="gray-workstation-niche-open-shelves" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50582 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned.jpg" alt="gray workstation niche with open shelves and white desk after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">(Above) Chicago design project by Carly Moeller. Photos by Dustin Halleck Photography.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Bedroom/bath suites are sanctuaries</h3>
<p class="p2">This remains a prime candidate for opening up small rooms or moving walls. “In one, we turned the top floor into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary suite</a>,” said Carly. “There had been two smaller bedrooms and a bath.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">Making room for hobbies, games, and exercise</h3>
<p class="p2">Activities like crafts, exercising, gaming, indoor driving ranges are inspiring re-dedication of real estate, especially in basements.  There’s a need for versatility and multitasking flex spaces. <span class="s2">This is not unlike the megamansion feature a few years back: dedicated rooms for wrapping packages.</span></p>
<p class="p2">“Workout and meditation rooms also are requested. Square footage needs to be multifunctional,&#8221; said Emily. &#8220;Clients now are considering more creative solutions. &#8216;Why don’t we rip out the dining room and put in a killer lounge?&#8217;” She continued, <span class="s2">“I converted my own garage. Lounge chairs, leftover rugs, heaters—for the kids.</span>&#8220;The City Council of Chicago has removed a ban that had prohibited ADUs since 1957. Be sure to find a contractor who is <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up-to-date on local codes and regulations</a>.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Expanding space with visual tricks</h3>
<p class="p2">Adding large windows and skylights brings in natural light and visually expands space. Also, without adding square footage, raising ceiling heights makes a room live larger.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Chicago home design trends: Making a statement</h3>
<p class="p2">Chicagoans are personalizing more in home remodeling. There’s more room for a little drama. Focal points include sculptural bathtubs, kitchen islands punctuated with bold veining, or floor-to-ceiling featured fireplaces. Solving clutter in clean, functional spaces that are comfortable and make you feel good is the goal.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, we’re taking a look at the rebirth of a trinity townhouse in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Center City Philadelphia. The house, built in the style of a trinity, a slim structure that became popular during a population boom in the early 18th century, caught Nel&#8217;s eye while she was looking to purchase her first home. Two years later, the house was severely damaged by a fire that ravaged the entire street, resulting in a total gut.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 1,200-square-foot home has three stories—plus a basement and roof deck with amazing city views—and had to be rebuilt from the studs up. Nel decided to keep the original floor plans intact—the first-floor dining room and kitchen, second-floor living room plus full bath, and third-floor master bedroom and bath—and bring them back to life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/18505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her renovation plans in mind</a>, she came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free platform connecting homeowners to vetted general contractors, to restore the house to its former glory and find a new tenant who would love it just as much as she did.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01.webp" alt="Trinity house in Philadelphia" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57264" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/908_082-1000px.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><b><br />
Sweeten: </b>What motivated you to purchase this trinity house and what led to the renovation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>In 2014 I was looking to purchase my first home, and when I saw this house I absolutely fell in love with it. The house is a 100-year-old trinity located in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Center City Philadelphia. I&#8217;m not sure if you have seen many trinities, but they are a pretty common home type in Philadelphia where the house is three stories tall and each floor is typically a single room. I met Greg shortly thereafter and the two of us lived in the house up until we got engaged in April 2016. We decided to move out because we were thinking about starting a family and wanted to find a home with a second bedroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was a bit attached to this house and since I work in real estate we decided to try our hand at renting it versus selling it. We found great tenants and everything was going well until the fire last October. The fire destroyed six houses—so basically, the entire block! It was heart-wrenching to watch something I had so many happy memories in be destroyed by fire. But, very fortunately, we have been able to rebuild, which actually has been a funny process because we were able to make some of the upgrades and changes we previously wanted to do when we lived there.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What made you choose the neighborhood back when you were looking to purchase a home?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>The Bella Vista neighborhood is truly one of my favorites in Philadelphia. We have a 100-year-old Italian bakery at the end of our street and so there is always the wonderful smell of something delicious baking in the air. We are also just around the corner from a park with a bocce court, as well as from the 9th Street Italian Market. I love the neighborhood&#8217;s vibe and all of the small independent businesses and restaurants that are at our front door.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What’s your favorite part of the house?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>I think one of my favorite parts, aside from the 360-degree views from the roof deck, is the exposed brick wall. It feels like a piece of history which is really neat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What it was like working with your general contractor?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>This is actually our second renovation in 12 months, but our first time using Sweeten. I can&#8217;t tell you how wonderful our Sweeten contractor has been. He took a very stressful situation and guided us through it with ease, and we couldn&#8217;t have been happier with how everything has turned out. Greg and I have actually joked about moving back in!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>Now that the house is finished, what are your plans for it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>We are going to keep it as a rental for now and who knows&#8230;maybe someday we will live there again!</p>

<p><strong>Now let’s check in with the Sweeten general contractor responsible for this townhouse’s transformation.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> What were the challenges you faced while renovating this trinity house?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor:</b> It was the amount of work that needed to take place in the small footprint of the house. We needed to add new code-compliant systems to a home that was designed to have a small footprint over 100 years ago! Several homes on the same block that were also damaged in the fire were under construction at the same time, so parking was limited. Material deliveries on the small street were very tough, if not impossible. All of the materials for the roof deck and drywall needed to be loaded in by hand. Also, work on the roof deck was held up due to permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What was the damage done by the fire?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>The entire home was flooded by the water used to extinguish the rooftop fire. The house was dried out and all damaged organic materials were removed prior to us being hired by a restoration company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> What major work did you and your team tackle during the renovation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>We installed all new electric, some plumbing, a new high-efficiency HVAC, insulation, drywall, and new finishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> Did you encounter any delays during the process?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>Yes, the roof deck had to be designed by a licensed architect—we couldn&#8217;t replace what was there under the permit for the interior. The drawings for the roof deck also needed to be completed and reviewed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> The results are simply stunning—all of your hard work has definitely paid off!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>Overall, it was a great project, Nel was a wonderful client and we couldn&#8217;t have done it without Sweeten making the match. We are very proud of the work we did here and how the home turned out.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Nel and her Sweeten general contractor for sharing their story, both the good and the bad, and giving us a look inside this reborn trinity!</em></p>
