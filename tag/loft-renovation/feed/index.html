<h3>Appealing to the ideal renter</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally when entrepreneur, we will call him AC, bought his apartment,  he intended to live there himself. However, after a few months, he decided it would make an even better investment property as a rental. To make it more renter-friendly, he wanted to enclose the upstairs loft. Doing so would convert the apartment into a two-bedroom —opening it up to a whole new market. He also wanted the design of the space to reflect the neighborhood vibe and attract young professionals with a modern aesthetic and lifestyle. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take on this rental property upgrade, he needed a professional for the renovation. </span></p>
<h3>Finding the renovation team</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AC <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/44564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project</a> on </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a> and hired <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a>. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The contractor I found through Sweeten was great because he was very flexible with the changes to the scope of the work,” says AC. “Plus, the Sweeten team was accommodating and always on top of looking after my project.”</span></strong></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h3>Choosing the finishes</h3>
<p>To appeal to young professionals, <span style="font-weight: 400;">AC chose on-trend luxe materials and finishes. He put in brass hardware that pops against the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/blue-kitchen-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deep-blue kitchen cabinets</a>. The cabinets weren’t originally this color, but AC knew that simply painting this rich hue would drastically change the look of the space. He was right. It went from drab to sophisticated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also made other smart paint choices. He brought the stair railing up-to-date with a new coat of paint and gave one of the bedrooms a masculine dark-blue accent wall. The bathroom was refreshed as well, adding interest with gray walls instead of plain white. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="double-vessel-sink-vanity-and-mirror"  class="alignnone wp-image-44286 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Alfonso-Bathroom-Vanity-2.jpg" alt="double glass vessel basin sink vanities with mirrors and granite countertop and dark bathroom walls after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Alfonso-Bathroom-Vanity-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Alfonso-Bathroom-Vanity-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Alfonso-Bathroom-Vanity-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Creating a second bedroom</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of the renovation was more behind-the-scenes. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/putting-walls-multifunctional-spaces-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newly-enclosed bedroom required</a> the electrical to be rewired and recessed lighting was added. They also changed the narrow hallway into a more useful space by configuring it as a small office area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AC’s advice to those thinking of renovation? “Just to be realistic,” he says. “With little changes, you can make a big impact.”</span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, AC, for sharing the results of your rental property upgrade.</em></p>

<p>Joanna &amp; Mark&#8217;s 1-bedroom loft in Clinton Hill was a perfect place for the couple to spread out and enjoy their work &amp; hobbies &#8211;that is, until the day they found out they&#8217;d be having a baby! With a new addition to the family on her way, the mother &amp; father-to-be needed to make <a href="/2012/12/06/site-visit-designing-for-a-bk-loft-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some changes</a> at home, including more storage options and, of course, a place for their daughter, while also keeping workspace available for Mark, a composer, multimedia artist &amp; student. So, the expecting couple posted their project to Sweeten, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors and, after meeting their matches, chose a Sweeten general contractor for their renovation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="hardwood-floors-and-white-walls"  class="wp-image-38650 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/x-large-4-560x420.jpeg" alt="living room with track lights and white walls and hardwood floors and doors after renovation" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/x-large-4.jpeg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/x-large-4-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Before renovating, the 950 sqft loft had a lot of open space, including an area for Mark to practice music and store his equipment.</p>
<p><span id="more-7500"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="planning-and-building-a-bedroom"  class="wp-image-38651 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/03_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-1-560x420.jpeg" alt="planning and building a bedroom with a curved wall corner next to living room during renovation" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/03_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-1.jpeg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/03_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-1-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />Here&#8217;s that same view right after demo of the master bedroom walls; the workers are mapping out where the new walls will go. More on the design and construction process for this project <a href="/2012/12/06/site-visit-designing-for-a-bk-loft-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="living-room-with-curved-wall-corner"  class="wp-image-38652 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CH3-560x311.jpg" alt="living room and hallway with hardwood floors and gray walls and barn door and round wall corner floor to ceiling built-in bookshelves at the end of hallway after renovation" width="560" height="311" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CH3.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CH3-300x167.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> And here&#8217;s the finished space! The master bedroom stayed in the same location but was slightly reduced in size, and the new baby&#8217;s room is entered from the opposite side, near the bookshelf. Sarah was able to include a small nook for Mark&#8217;s music setup that opens to the living room or can be closed off &amp; out of sight behind a gorgeous reclaimed barn door on sliding hardware.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-7508 mb-24 " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/05_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill.jpeg" alt="caption" width="560" height="235" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/05_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill.jpeg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/05_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-300x126.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Looking back at an interior elevation drawing of the planned space before it was built &#8211;it&#8217;s so awesome to see how the design elements translated into real life!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="living-with-large-barn-door"  class="wp-image-38653 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/06_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-560x356.jpg" alt="open living and dining with a large barn door and gray wall and hardwood floors and track lighting and large window after renovation" width="560" height="356" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/06_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/06_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-300x191.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />It&#8217;s also great that Mark &amp; Joanna did not have to sacrifice their living space, yet their new home does so much more than before!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="end-of-hallway-book-shelves"  class="wp-image-38654 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/07_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-560x1015.jpg" alt="built-in floor to ceiling book shelves at the end of hallway with hardwood floors and pendant light and gray walls after renovation" width="560" height="1015" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/07_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/07_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-166x300.jpg 166w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/07_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-497x900.jpg 497w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />Sarah designed this floor-to-ceiling bookshelf which stores the family&#8217;s book collection and highlights the high-ceilings found throughout the space. Working closely with Joanna &amp; Mark, the designer also planned a future phase of their project which includes more ceiling-high shelving and a library ladder. Phasing their project out in this way gave the couple more opportunity to work within a budget.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="hand-painted-tree-wall-mural"  class="wp-image-38655 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/08__theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-560x652.jpg" alt="hand painted tree mural on a pastel green wall and shoe molding and hardwood floors after renovation" width="560" height="652" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/08__theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/08__theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-258x300.jpg 258w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The curved wall of the baby&#8217;s room will make it such a fun space to grow into!</p>
<p>Big thanks to homeowners Joanna and Mark, and to Sarah Zames of General Assembly!</p>
