<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30089 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace06-723x467.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="467" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace06-723x467.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace06-300x194.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace06-600x388.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><em>(Above) Domino</em> <em>Media Group</em> was matched with their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2708" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commercial general contractor</a> through <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten,</a> transforming an old sewing factory into the <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/dominos-new-office-is-so-domino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magazine&#8217;s offices</a></p>
<p>As a business owner, changing locations can be disruptive. Moving your company&#8217;s offices, particularly when you are growing very fast or you are very concerned about additional capital expenses, can be a challenging process that may distract attention from your core business and strategic needs. Keeping focused on your business objectives while finding the right physical space to move to is important. Consider these common mistakes to avoid when it comes to seeking new real estate:</p>
<h3>1. Putting cost far above all other criteria</h3>
<p>The expense to occupy real estate is a significant cost for most businesses. But to focus singularly on rent per square foot in today’s environment is a short-sighted plan. In a tight labor market, the choice of neighborhood and the appeal of a firm’s office space may be critical to attracting and retaining talent, especially if a firm seeks to appeal to millennials, who not only appreciate salary and benefit opportunities, but want to work in an environment that reflects the values of the company they choose.</p>
<p>The quality of space will also generate important productivity advantages, for example, if its character and design support collaborative creativity. An office space’s efficiency–how the rentable square feet (the square footage on which a tenant pays rent) correlates with programmable or “usable” space–may also make focusing solely on per rentable square foot cost comparisons less advantageous.</p>
<h3>2. Focusing on the space they need today instead of 18-24 months ahead</h3>
<p>Time moves quickly, and most conventional office leases are five to ten years in term. Too many companies, particularly those in growth mode, decide on an appropriately-sized space based on their anticipated headcount for only the first couple of years of their lease occupancy. Some worry about taking on too much space before it’s needed, but the possibility of offering surplus “desk space” to other firms may be negotiated in a lease, should a space be temporarily under capacity. It’s far better to anticipate growth than to make do with overcrowded conditions.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36783 size-full" title="commercial property" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-02.jpg" alt="Union Square play, commercial renovation, design, construction, remodel, renovation, leasing office space advice" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<em>(Above) </em>Union Square Play found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4407" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their general contractor</a> at <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten,</a> turning a bank office <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/union-square-play-commercial-property-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">into a children&#8217;s play space</a></p>
<h3>3. Believing that only subleasing space offers the most flexibility and cost efficiency</h3>
<p>It is true that sublease office space is generally less expensive than space leased directly from a landlord. In most cases, however, a sublet must be taken in “as is” condition, with minimal financial contribution from the sub-landlord to modify the space to suit a subtenant’s requirements. Typically, there is no flexibility in the sublease term and the subtenant has little leverage in negotiating a favorable rent for a term beyond the sublease expiration.</p>
<p>In contrast, leasing directly from a landlord may offer customization of the space either built by the landlord or by the tenant with a landlord’s “contribution” subsidizing the cost. A direct lease may also provide options and flexibility to accommodate potential occupancy growth.</p>
<h3>4. Not anticipating how long the space acquisition process will take</h3>
<p>When one rents an apartment directly from building management, the lease process typically takes less than five days. In contrast, negotiating an office or retail lease can take from two to eight weeks, depending on the attorneys involved, the complexity and length of the lease, and other factors.</p>
<p>Prior to lease negotiation, the site selection and business terms negotiation process can take from one to eight weeks for an immediate requirement that is well defined, and much longer if a real estate occupancy strategy must be developed to align with business goals.</p>
<h3>5. Planning for furniture too late in the process</h3>
<p>Furniture planning and acquisition are often considered as an afterthought in the process. Here are two reasons to focus on them concurrently with planning and design of the office space configuration. First, the lead time delivery of contract furniture can be four to six weeks, so, even if a space build-out is complete, the absence of installed and wired furniture means a tenant cannot open for business. Second, the placement of furniture/cabinetry/desks is critcial to space planning, specifically for the wiring of furniture for voice and data technology, which must be coordinated with the siting of voice and data ports in an office.</p>
<p>If a landlord builds a space out on behalf of a tenant, planning how furniture will be situated and wired should be incorporated into the space design process.</p>

<h3>6. Allowing first impressions to influence the decision-making</h3>
<p>When touring an office space, there are lots of factors that may influence an initial impression: for example, the time of day/natural light, the existing ceiling and ambient, or the density of existing partitions and furniture. It’s always best to tour space when the sun is out and it’s early in the day. Too many times, a potential tenant may rule out a space in less than a minute because of a negative first impression. Spend a little time in your potential new office and listen to the guidance of your real estate advisor who should recommend whether it&#8217;s worth a second look.</p>
<h3>7. Not realizing a landlord&#8217;s interest in the financial condition of the actual tenant</h3>
<p>It doesn’t matter how large or successful a related or parent corporate entity may be. A commercial landlord is only interested in the creditworthiness of the actual business entity signing the lease or providing a full corporate guarantee. This is often challenging for non-U.S.-based firms that establish new U.S. companies to operate here. Landlords do not care about the revenues or profitability of the foreign parent and do not want to pursue a foreign parent if the U.S. tenant defaults.</p>
<p>A related concern is the “good guy” guarantee. Most landlords require this limited personal guarantee from a U.S. citizen or permanent resident for nearly all privately held tenants, no matter how creditworthy. The intent is to ensure, in the event of a bankruptcy or some other rationale for a tenant stopping rent payments, that the landlord will not have to serve an eviction to get back clean possession of the leased premises (in order to lease to a new tenant).</p>

<h3>Why the right general contractor is important</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating can be a complicated process. However, the more you know about working with a general contractor, the better prepared you’ll be. While these professionals execute the labor of your renovation, they are also a collaborator to your dream home. Their team will be working in your space for several months. Because of this, you really want to be confident in knowing how to hire a contractor<span>—the right one for <em>your</em> project</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten outlines the process—from what to look for, to the key responsibilities you can expect from your general contractor.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Do you need a general contractor or a handyman?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first step to starting your project is figuring out the scope of your renovation. Depending on the level of labor your project requires, you will either need a general contractor or a handyman (or DIY!). To decipher the difference, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are you hanging things on walls, or taking down walls?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are you re-grouting tiles, or replacing them?</li>
<li>Smaller projects to make repairs or patch-over errors are handyman-ready. On the other hand, large-scale projects that involve electric or plumbing will require a permit or inspection. In this case, a contractor with a state Home Improvement Contractor (HIC) license will be obligatory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining labor for your renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For first-time renovators, figuring out what kind of labor is required for the project can be hard to determine. If you live in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-op</a> or condo, your alteration agreement may provide guidelines when hiring a general contractor. In other situations, checking your city’s Department of Buildings will offer information on the types of projects that require a permit. <strong>The most important thing to remember is that cutting corners with unlicensed workers is never worth the risk. </strong>It often leads to homeowners needing to pay extra to fix unfinished, subpar, or non-permitted work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doing the research to determine if you need the services of a general contractor is a crucial step in getting your project off the ground. Then the next step is finding the best contractor for your job.</p>
<h3 class="p1">How to hire a contractor suited to your project</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the process of interviewing and hiring a general contractor, start by looking for someone with experience in your neighborhood and who has done similar work. This can help you narrow down the field from thousands of general contractors to just a handful of experienced professionals. Keep these questions in mind as you search:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Has the contractor done work in your neighborhood?</li>
<li>Has the contractor done similar work to what you’re looking to get done?</li>
<li>Can the contractor provide quality references and photos of past work?</li>
<li>Is the contractor licensed? (Working with an unlicensed contractor isn’t worth the risk!)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask to see some of their past projects in person or to speak to their past clients—at least two. General contractors in Sweeten&#8217;s network have completed transformational renovations with past clients who are still happy with the work years later. This indicates that the contractor&#8217;s work has held up over time. <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten matches homeowners</a> to a selection of contractors based on location, budget, scope, and style for the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you&#8217;ve found someone you think would be a good fit for your project, take it one step further and make sure they’re a good fit for you. You’ll be working with this contractor for the duration of your project, so you should feel compatible! Here&#8217;s what to look for:</p>
<h4>Are they communicative?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you can trust your contractor to be responsive throughout the entire renovation process. Both parties will need to be on the same page, especially in terms of timeline.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is it a good fit personality and style-wise?</h4>
<ul>
<li>First impressions do matter! The contractor should be able to understand and carry out your particular sense of style. Additionally, with the amount of time they’ll be spending in your home, look for someone who meshes with your personality.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Do they have recent and reliable references?</h4>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s important<span style="color: #333333;"> to review </span>recent references for similar projects that your contractor has completed. You should be aware of the level of satisfaction of past clients. At Sweeten, our contractors have profiles that highlight past projects and client reviews to help you decide.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What does a general contractor do?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your general contractor manages your project from start to finish, focusing on the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Obtain proper licensing, insurance, and additional documents required by city, state, and specific to building needs</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Review site conditions and all relevant documents and drawings in order to fully understand the project and generate a proposal and bid (the proposal is the plan and the bid is the proposed cost)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Specify the final scope of work, and schedule, and come up with a contract</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Define the payment and deliverables schedules</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Request and follow advice from the architects, engineers, or design team</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Manage and coordinate general aspects of a project, like site requirements</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Provide skilled labor, tools, equipment, and various services</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Coordinate subcontractors and other trades required by the scope of work and oversee the quality of their work</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Maintain schedule and communication with clients</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Review project completion with the client and final payment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asking general contractors for estimates (at least 3)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A contractor will partner with you to decide on:</p>
<ol>
<li>The final scope of work</li>
<li>Materials</li>
<li>Timeline</li>
<li>The best form of communication, and how often they should check in with you</li>
<li>Budget and payment schedule (make sure you have everything in writing)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sweeten recommends getting 3-5 estimates from contractors to see where the price range falls. This also allows you to experience the different personalities and communication styles of the contractors. Who do you have the best rapport with? Who do you feel the most comfortable with? These factors will play a big part in your decision when hiring a general contractor.</p>
<h3>Understanding estimates from general contractors</h3>
<p>Bid leveling is a crucial step that will allow you to break down and compare the services the contractor can offer at each price point. This occurs once you have received estimates, or bids, from contractors.</p>
<p>For example, one contractor who gives a higher-priced bid may provide more individual services, like answering questions on the weekend or putting a mood board together for you. A comparative breakdown of the bids will reveal a clearer picture of what services you want as a renovator.</p>
<h4>Sweeten offers free bid-leveling services to homeowners</h4>
<p>New to renovating and unsure how to read bids? Sweeten provides a free bid-leveling call to all homeowners who use the service. Read all about Sweeten&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/bid-leveling-call-for-renovation-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid leveling and estimate comparison call.</a> (You can also read up on this process with Sweeten&#8217;s guide to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid leveling</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you meet the contractors during site visits, be prepared with a list of questions to ask. Do not be afraid to speak up about what you want! That being said, be open to a contractor&#8217;s ideas and suggestions. The licensed contractor is a professional with a wealth of knowledge about construction and years of experience. This is their specialty, and they likely have answers to all of your questions.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29717 mb-10 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation cost" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label"> (Above) Brooke and Paul&#8217;s Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/1920s-westchester-home-gets-a-modern-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation</a> in Pelham, New York</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Westchester County </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no doubt that Westchester is a picturesque place to live—the luxury of space and peace with the bustle of New York City a quick trip away. Some recent buyers and established homeowners alike feel it would be even more idyllic if they had their dream kitchen, whether it&#8217;s renovating a new home or fulfilling a long-desired wish to upgrade. The first step is often the stumbling block: determining the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/kitchen-renovation-costs-money-goes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">national average</a> for a basic 200-square-foot kitchen renovation is $63,829.  Westchester County has a slightly higher average <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation cost</a> landing at <strong>$65,651</strong> or <strong>$328 a square foot</strong>, according to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association (NKBA). Let’s break that budget down into bite-sized pieces to help you get closer to your dream cooking and entertaining space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DESIGN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an important line item in your budget, especially if your vision involves a layout change. That could involve moving load-bearing walls and gas lines. The NKBA estimates design fees eat up about four percent of a kitchen remodel cost. Sweeten designer <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, who has done work in Westchester, said it&#8217;s more realistic to put away 15 percent of your budget for design if you’re in the mood for a major layout change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re giving your kitchen more of a makeover than an overhaul, it’s possible to work closely with an experienced general contractor on the design and forgo a designer. Statistics from the NKBA show that the majority of homeowners relied on a general contractor and only 22 percent used a designer. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck</a>, a Sweeten contractor who works in Westchester, has found that many clients in the county take a hands-on approach to design and often don’t use a designer or architect. However, an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect&#8217;s services will be needed</a> if plumbing or gas lines are moving, there are structural changes, or if a landmark property is being renovated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PERMITS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building permits are handled by the building department of each individual town within Westchester County. &#8220;Individual&#8221; is the key word here because methods of calculations can change dramatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Rye, the most of the <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/money/real-estate/homes/2017/03/22/westchester-priciest-zipcodes/99506058/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive</a> area in Southern Westchester—the median price for a home is $1,380,000—it’s no surprise that building permits are calculated based on the cost of a renovation. For every $1,000 in your kitchen remodel budget, that’s an additional $17 for your building permits. That average $64,000 kitchen overhaul will cost at least $1,088 in permits. If plumbing and electrical permits are required, that’s an additional $200 a pop (for a less extensive renovation, these permits may not be necessary).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the township of Peekskill, building permit costs are at the end of a minor mathematical equation. Multiply the square footage of your project by $150. Then, multiply that figure by 0.10. For a 200-square-foot kitchen, that’s $3,000. So take a moment to look at how the building department of your township calculates permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/westchester-county-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-34831 size-full" title="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png" alt="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" width="320" height="60" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png 320w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>APPLIANCES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Village Appliances in Westchester, a budget appliance package (fridge, oven, dishwasher and microwave), can go for under $5,000. However, Joe Gagliardo, the owner of Village Appliances, doesn’t sell too many of those. The majority of customers either go for a package in the $5,000 to $8,000 range or in the mid-price range of $18,000 to $22,000, which will get you brands such as General Electric and Electrolux. The high-end price spectrum will deliver brands such as Viking and Miele for a four-piece suite (fridge, range, hood, and dishwasher) at a price ranging from $17,000 to $26,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At <a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bilotta Kitchens</a>, clients often buy in the $12,000 to $15,000 range for an appliance package, according to senior designer and CKD Randy O’Kane. This will get you brands such as Thermador, Sub-Zero, and Wolf. There’s always room to mix and match, but brands do offer a discount or throw in items like blenders, toasters and hoods for free if you go with the same brand for your appliances, Randy said. “It is the heart and soul of a kitchen,” she said. “Cabinets are great, but it is all about cooking.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation can cost between $500 and $1,000, and that price will depend on how much work your contractor has already done. If water lines have not been run or outlets are not in the necessary areas, that could push up installation costs, Joe said. For those after custom range hoods, then plan for the $2,000 and $8,000 range.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CABINETS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinets and hardware (think handles and knobs) are a big-ticket item on every kitchen remodel cost budget. They typically take up 30 percent of costs, according to NKBA. In a basic kitchen renovation, that’s $6,000. For a major overhaul worth $60,000, cabinets cost almost $20,000. What typically makes a big <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difference in cabinet cost</a> is whether you want custom, pre-fabricated or a mix of both. Something pre-fabricated from IKEA or Home Depot will cost around $130 a linear foot. Custom jobs can shoot up to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear square foot</a>. However, with that higher price, there is more freedom in deciding your kitchen layout. You can also get <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a> with custom cabinets. Semi-custom cabinets generally are about 50 percent cheaper than full custom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or do what Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill did in her own kitchen renovation: the recycled customized option. &#8220;I scoured Renovation Angel&#8217;s website and purchased a used-but-high-end kitchen for about $10,000, which is what I could have spent on cabinets alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A complete kitchen included appliances and cabinetry.&#8221; Jean then customized the cabinets to fit her space, which often meant filler panels were wider on one side than the other, or building a soffit was necessary. &#8220;It was like working on a jigsaw puzzle in order to make the kitchen look like it fit in the space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I was okay with these kinds of imperfections in exchange for essentially getting a premium kitchen on an Ikea type of budget.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>COUNTERTOPS</strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.westchesterkitchenandbath.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester Kitchen and Bath</a>, quartz is overwhelmingly the most popular countertop, according to showroom manager and designer Donna Magnotta. “It’s heat-, stain-, scratch-, and bacteria-resistant,” she said, “and it&#8217;s maintenance-free.” Natural stones, like marble, need routine staining and sealing. Quartz starts around $85 per linear foot and is on the mid to high-end of the price scale, which includes the cost of fabricating and installing. Laminate starts at $20 a linear foot, but is rarely purchased, Donna said. Granite is next up the ladder at about $35 a linear foot. On the high end, natural stones start at about $120 a linear foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LIGHTING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kitchen lighting isn’t a big budget line item. It takes up on four percent of total costs on average. The end price, of course, will always be determined by your tastes. In a $20,000 kitchen, that’s only $800. For a major remodel in the $60,000 range, lighting costs look closer to $2,400.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PLUMBING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On an average remodel, plumbing costs are about the same at $800. If there is a layout change to your Westchester kitchen, then that will likely add to your plumbing costs, which also includes gas lines. And the more you alter the basic layout of your space, the more your kitchen remodel cost will increase for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting, and inspections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FLOORING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a budget, Westchester’s <a href="https://suburbanfloors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suburban Floors</a> has a vinyl Karndean-Knight Tile that is $3.50 a square foot that is “still very durable and stylish,” said Emily Carpentieri, the store’s owner. The price per square foot does not include installation. On the higher end is cork or wide-plank wood flooring. These go for $8.25 to $15 a square foot. But vinyl floors in the $5 to $7 range is Suburban Floors’ biggest seller. “These would blow your mind how real they looked,” said Emily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LABOR AND INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction labor can change depending upon your Westchester zip code. The costs are less expensive the further you are from NYC. For Peekskill, labor costs are 22 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr.com</a>. Dobbs Ferry comes in at 40 percent higher and Croton-on-Hudson at 27 percent higher than the national average. The kitchen renovation cost in Rye could have a labor budget 55 percent above the national average. To compare, the labor cost for a kitchen renovation on the Upper East Side is 77 percent higher than the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t forget installation for appliances, cabinetry, plumbing, and electrical. These typically take about 17 percent of a budget, which is about $3,500 for an average kitchen. And as mentioned above, factor in $500 to $1,000 for appliance installation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, renovations are like fingerprints<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no two are alike. That includes their budgets. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator in Westchester allocated their $56,620 renovation budget:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine cooking in your new kitchen for the first time&#8230;the style! The smart layout! The shiny new appliances and lovely lighting! The team at Sweeten is inspired daily by our clients’ posts describing their renovation dreams, and the best place to start the process is with a realistic budget. Sweeten&#8217;s guide will help you learn what to expect for kitchen renovation costs.</p>
<h3>Average kitchen renovation costs in the U.S.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The national average for a basic kitchen renovation is <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$22,000</a> and swings up to about $60,000 for a major overhaul. What if your desires exceed your bank account? Tweaking the budget so your project comes within your price range while maintaining quality begins with understanding the cost breakdown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen design costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association&#8217;s (NKBA) estimates design fees will comprise about four percent of your budget. Although this percentage could grow. For example, a kitchen designer in NYC might cost 15 percent of that budget, says <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, a Sweeten designer. The NKBA also found that only 22 percent of homeowners renovating a kitchen or a bathroom actually hired a designer. Instead, many chose to work closely with an experienced general contractor on their design to bring down the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just remember that your design will play a big role in the end budget. If you’re dreaming of a layout change that involves moving load-bearing walls and gas lines, take into account the additional paperwork, inspections, and fees later on.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Appliances</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The more you value your cooking skills, the sooner you should make your budget decisions in this category. “If the client falls in love with a 48-inch range, the designer can fit that into the design,” explains Jace Kieffer from <a href="https://www.kieffers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kieffer’s Appliances</a> in Lansdale, PA. Your appliance and ventilation choices may impact the design, he adds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a starter home, a basic four-appliance kitchen set—range, fridge, microwave and dishwasher—costs around $2,000. However, if you’re renovating a kitchen, it’s likely you will want to upgrade to at least premium economy appliances. They cost between $4,000 and $5,000 and have a life expectancy of about seven years. Luxury brands will set you back at least $12,000, a cost that should be weighed against their 15-year life expectancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Across the country, you’re unlikely to see much variation in the cost of luxury appliances. That’s because manufacturers often put minimum price restrictions on their appliances (sorry, no Black Friday deals here). If you’re happy with a lower grade, it might be worth shopping around for a sweeter price.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Ventilation</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like appliances, it is helpful to factor ventilation into the plans early. A basic over-the-range hood that leaves room for the microwave goes for around $300. A standalone hood from a premium economy brand costs $500 or more. A luxury brand might set you back about $2,000. Customs hoods from a metal fabricator can cost upwards of $10,000, Jace said. You also need to plan for ducting, which a general contractor usually takes care of.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Cabinets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest investment of your kitchen renovation will likely be cabinetry and hardware (such as handles and knobs)&#8211;this category typically makes up about 30 percent of budgets. A big factor in pricing will be your preference for custom or pre-fabricated cabinets from stores like Home Depot and IKEA. Stock cabinets average out at about $130 for a linear foot. For a custom job, the price might be as much as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear foot</a>. Custom cabinets will give you greater freedom when deciding your kitchen layout and finished look. It could also get you <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a>. Don’t forget that these cabinets must be installed and that will likely be an additional cost. See more on labor and installation below.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an area where you can scrimp or splurge, depending on your priorities. Countertops can start at $5 per square foot for a butcher’s block or laminate, a synthetic material. A low-end quartz could cost about $50 a square foot and a marble around $60 a square foot. Something more pricey such as granite could cost as much as $100 a square foot. Don’t forget to factor in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backsplash</a>, which is the wall area between the countertop and cabinets. That could range from $3 a square foot to $35.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Floors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Flooring will represent 7 percent of an average budget, or about $1,400, according to the NKBA. Concrete or vinyl flooring are economical choices and can look cool along with being easy to clean. Stone or wood flooring are higher-end options. Keep in mind that new base cabinets that are a different depth than your original may expose old and mismatched flooring.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lighting in the kitchen</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is generally a lower-spend category. In a $20,000 budget, lighting materials usually come in at about $800. Again, this will move up or down depending on your tastes. Besides ventilation, those remodeling their kitchens spent the least on lighting, according to the NKBA.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen plumbing costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like everything else in renovating, your vision and choices will have a big impact on kitchen plumbing costs. On an average remodel, plumbing materials will match lighting expenses at about $800. If you’re considering that layout change then plumbing and gas lines may have to move. That will lead to the added costs in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting and inspections.</p>
<h3><b>Kitchen remodel labor and installation costs</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Preparing the renovation site—leveling tilted floors, replacing the sheetrock, etc.—can cost a few thousand dollars. Add to that installation of appliances and cabinetry, plumbing and electrical, which could take about 17 percent of your total budget or almost $3,500 on an average kitchen renovation. It’s worth pointing out that labor costs can change based on geography. New York City is the most expensive. Chicago’s labor costs are on average about 18 percent cheaper, according to RSMeans data. Philadelphia is a few percentage points lower at about 21 percent and LA sits at more than 30 percent lower than New York. And check with your contractor if their fees cover permits. If not, that could add another $1,000 or two.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Resale Value</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Setting a budget can be overwhelming with the cost of all these separate items. The good news is renovations are an investment. For example, a $62,000 investment in a kitchen <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could see</a> a $40,000 increase in resale value on the home, according to Remodeling Magazine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, that also increases the value of your property for taxation purposes. In Philadelphia, home improvements can get a <a href="https://www.biaofphiladelphia.com/tax-abatement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax abatement</a>. The value your new kitchen adds to your home will not be taxed for 10 years, said Marianne Scott from the Building Industry Association of Philadelphia. Similar programs exist in many other cities such as Pittsburgh and <a href="https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/community-development/housing-assistance/residential-property-tax-abatement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cincinnati</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, no two renovations and their budgets are the same. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator allocated their $25,000 kitchen renovation budget:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Each week, we aim to translate insight from Sweeten experts into information you can use to make better decisions about improving your home. This week and next, let&#8217;s take on flooring. I might be biased, because new floors were the very first step I took in renovating my tiny East Village apartment, but I cannot possibly think of a better way to get a bigger bang for your buck. If you are looking to transform the way your home feels, you can do it with new floors in less than a week&#8217;s time. For proof of its impact, scroll through these flooring selections some of our favorite homeowners have made in the last year. <em><strong>Next week, check back for the full low-down on the process and cost of re-doing your floors.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11524 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11534 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_06.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="340" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_06.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_06-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Williamsburg, <a href="https://sweeten.com/2013/10/31/katie-elliots-williamsburg-townhouse-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katie and Elliot renovated</a> with Mirage Knotty Walnut floors throughout the first floor of their townhouse. The natural knots and irregularities serve as a counterpoint to the clean cabinet lines and modern lighting fixtures. I&#8217;m always amazed at how<span id="more-11520"></span> simple white walls set against warm wood tones makes a space feel clean, bright, and relaxed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11527 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11530 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_03b.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="340" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_03b.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_03b-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kyle and Angela replaced their Clinton Hill parquet with white oak, left unstained. The simple color and texture of the new floors is such a smart complement to the custom walnut millwork, saturated green accents, and mid-century modern decor that makes this home so unique.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11522 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_AMarch-42ndStCombo-1000w.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_AMarch-42ndStCombo-1000w.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11_SWEETEN_AMarch-42ndStCombo-1000w-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11539 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_02d.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="340" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_02d.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_02d-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Hell&#8217;s Kitchen, a homeowner combining three apartments unified the space with a custom engineered white oak floor from Master Floor, an Italian company. The planks are pre-finished with a matte effect, which keeps your eye focused on these incredible views and amplifies natural light throughout the apartment without adding any glare.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11536 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-05.jpg" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-05-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11528 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_01.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="340" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_01.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_01-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen of their Brooklyn row house, Allison and Jovito chose a porcelain tile, finished to look like wood. For extra visual impact, they laid the tile in a herringbone pattern. Porcelain was an especially smart choice for these cat owners: tile is more durable than softer wood materials and is easy to keep clean in a high-traffic area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11537 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-111.jpg" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-111.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-111-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_04.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11531 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_04.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="340" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_04.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_04-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Chelsea, this homeowner, an architect and designer, kept the wood floors that were original to the iconic London Terrace building but transformed them with a matte black finish. The decor choices throughout this apartment are so glamorous &#8211; this dark matte finish helps diversify the feel and gives a little bit of grit and texture to the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11525 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11533 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_05.png" alt="underfoot flooring" width="600" height="340" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_05.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_Flooring_05-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In their Williamsburg entryway, <a href="https://sweeten.com/2013/10/31/katie-elliots-williamsburg-townhouse-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katie and Elliot left the concrete floor</a> intact but re-painted it with gray, creating a neutral and super functional spot to drop shoes and contain everyday items.</p>
