<h3>Compact living in a junior one bedroom</h3>
<p>Dan and I lived on the Lower East Side for several years in typical rental apartments—tiny, no living rooms, dated kitchens and baths, and windows looking into someone else’s kitchen. In NYC real estate terms, this translates into “cozy!” We’re not big fans of moving, so purchasing an apartment together was always on our minds.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p class="p1">Often, we’d walk past our current apartment building and joke about purchasing a studio there if we could find a relatively cheap unit to gut-renovate. Somehow this apartment showed up in an internet search and met our expectations, so we decided to buy it. We closed on the purchase but lived in our old apartment while the renovations were in progress.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44843 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Claire-livingroom-6_compressed.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Claire-livingroom-6_compressed.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Claire-livingroom-6_compressed-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Claire-livingroom-6_compressed-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44585 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-12.jpg" alt="junior one bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44588 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-livingroom-7.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-livingroom-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-livingroom-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-livingroom-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span>The co-op had been built in the ‘60s and had not been touched—it was ugly. We knew it would need a complete overhaul. Our primary goal was some separation between the living/kitchen area and the sleeping space. We wanted it to feel less like a studio and more like a junior one bedroom.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="large-black-framed-window" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44842 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Claire-bedroom-13-compressed.gif" alt="large black framed window in a white bedroom with barn door after renovation" width="1000" height="674" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44579 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bedroom-5.jpg" alt="junior one bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bedroom-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bedroom-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bedroom-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Making a junior one bedroom work</h3>
<p class="p1">Because of Department of Building regulations, our architect said we couldn’t install full walls to divide the space. After a brainstorm with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/when-do-you-need-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architect</a> and our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractor, we decided to install custom sliding doors fabricated by a vendor. The doors allow us to keep the space open, but we can close them when we have overnight guests or just want some privacy. Though it was challenging to figure out the right door dimensions and make sure the ceiling was even, I think it was a smart investment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44583 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />In addition, we wanted to remove the wall between the kitchen and the living space, fully renovate the kitchen and bathroom, and install new hardwood floors throughout. Fun—not fun—story: we ordered a new toilet online, and it came broken three times in a row. We were only able to get it in one piece when we picked it up at the store.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44581" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2.jpg" alt="Lower East Side renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<blockquote><p>
It’s a dusty business, so live somewhere else during a gut renovation, if possible&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Simple color palette for a small space</h3>
<p>Given the apartment’s small size, I used a limited material palette and color scheme—sort of a mix of Scandinavian, Japanese, and Lower East Side flavors. We went with white kitchen cabinets and tiles, chrome, black hardware, and a red oak floor. My favorite part of the renovation was picking materials and envisioning how each would look in the space. It was hard to find things I liked that fit our limited budget! However, I incorporated interesting textures and colors through decoration and furnishings so it wouldn’t feel too clinical.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44584 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-11.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44582 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-8.jpg" alt="pattern backsplash tile" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44586 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-knook-9.jpg" alt="Eat-in niche" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-knook-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-knook-9-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-knook-9-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>The right contractor for a first-time renovator</h3>
<p>My contractor was resourceful in accommodating our various needs and provided honest recommendations on what was feasible or not. For example, having a soaking tub in the bathroom was very important for Dan since he loves taking baths. Our bathroom door was tiny, so we weren&#8217;t sure how the tub would actually get in. Our contractor figured out how to open up the closet wall next to the bathroom and inserted the tub that way.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44576" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bathroom-1.jpg" alt="Bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h4>Sweeten lends advice and support</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I appreciated that the Sweeten team was approachable and knowledgeable about my first-timer renovator questions. The team hopped on a call to discuss potential contractors and provided useful tips on how to make the hiring decision. They also frequently checked in during the renovation and were available for help as needed.  </span></p>
<h3>Renovation tips: Budget and expectations</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re renovating—even for a junior one bedroom—plan on it taking more time and money than you anticipate—there are always unexpected things that happen as you go through the process. We ended up spending roughly 25% more than the original budget since we added change orders to address issues that came up. Decide on your renovation “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves” and stick with them. It’s a dusty business, so live somewhere else during a gut renovation, if possible, and invest in an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/clean-up-after-major-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">air purifier and a professional cleaning</a> afterward. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t feel pressured to decorate everything right after you move in. Be patient, live with the apartment for a while with existing items, and figure out what you need. Also, buy vintage furniture if you can! </span><span class="s1">Now our new space finally feels like home :) </span></p>

<h3>Time for a place with no roommates</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I moved to New York in 2007 after graduating college and settled in Hell’s Kitchen because of its relative affordability and proximity to the subway. For the first nine years, I lived in a large cookie-cutter rental building with two roommates, and first started looking into buying about three years ago. There were two motivating factors behind my search: The first was that I felt it was time to have my own place. I had lived with roommates since I was 18, and it was a great way to save money on the margin, but I was ready for a change. I had always thought that owning my own place in New York would be a proud moment and an important milestone in my life. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The second reason was financial, as I had seen our rent increase over $1,500 in my time there. That was a tough pill to swallow, but at least manageable when splitting it with a roommate. I didn’t want to put myself in that position if I lived alone, however. I had saved enough money over time <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/mortgage-101-everything-need-home-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to cover a down payment</a> and soon found myself checking the real estate websites on a daily basis to find the “perfect” apartment.</span></p>

<h3>A one-bedroom with a lot of light</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My two main requirements were that the apartment had one bedroom and good light. I also wanted to stay in Hell’s Kitchen so that I could still walk to work. But I quickly realized that there was no such thing as a “perfect” one-bedroom apartment in my price range, and anything that was close to what I wanted would go into contract within days of the initial listing. Competition was stiff. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, one day, after a year or so of looking, I decided to look more seriously at alcove studios with the idea of putting up a wall to create a one bedroom. I ended up finding a studio that was listed as a “junior one bedroom” on the top floor of a 1930s co-op in Hell’s Kitchen/Clinton. The kitchen and bathroom were a bit dated,  but that was less of a priority for me. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">My contractor matched all of the crown moldings to the originals in the apartment. Honestly, I didn’t expect it to look as good as it does.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">More importantly, the current owner had already set up a large built-in bookcase to separate the bed area from the general living space—so you couldn’t even see the bed—and there were windows on both sides—two large ones facing north with trees offering privacy into the interior space and three large windows facing east toward my neighbor’s apartment. This was the exact studio layout I needed for my conversion into a true one bedroom.</span></p>

<h3>Junior one-bedroom remodel takes longer than expected</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The original timeline was four to five weeks, but the project ended up taking eight weeks to complete. (A heads-up to first-time renovators: It does cost more and takes longer than you expect. It’s New York City, after all, so you need to account for this variability). In my case, part of the extended timeline was due to Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My contractor helped in two ways though—one strategic and one tactical. First, it’s important to have the support of the co-op or building super for a renovation, and my contractor ensured that all of the co-op building work rules were met. Second, I would leave “to-do” lists each night toward the end of the renovation outlining items that I wanted to be addressed. I would then return the following day with each having been taken care of.</span></p>

<h3>Maximizing the layout of a cramped kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Updating the kitchen was a big part of the reno (and a big portion of the budget). The existing galley kitchen was from the 1980s and extremely small with little usable counter space. We maximized the layout so that it flowed better and felt less cramped. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The location of the stove and refrigerator were swapped. It not only provided more functional surfaces but we added an additional 14-inch ledge of counter space by the window. It had the effect of creating a wraparound spot where I could fit a stool and use it as a small breakfast bar. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40517 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-09.jpg" alt="penny tile backsplash" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Light colors welcome a gleaming shine</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since the kitchen is still small—about 60 square feet—I kept the colors very light. I chose white shaker cabinets with brushed nickel pulls, stainless steel appliances, and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low-maintenance Caeserstone-type quartz</a> (spilled red wine and coffee won&#8217;t stain). The counter material has modest strains of gray, gold, and brown, and complement the blueish-gray penny tile for the backsplash. The large gray floor tile helps elongate the small space. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was excited (and partially anxious) to see the various parts come together as a cohesive final product. I only had an idea of how everything would work together. The wall is fantastic and looks like it was always there. My contractor matched all of the crown moldings to the originals in the apartment. Honestly, I didn’t expect it to look as good as it does.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40510 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-02.jpg" alt="junior one bedroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1">It was important that the new full bedroom design maintain the apartment’s natural light. It also needed to be large enough to fit a queen-size bed comfortably and allow me to walk around without any issues. My goal was to have a real wall creating two separate rooms and not look like a temporary or flex wall. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40506 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-03.jpg" alt="bedroom before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now that I’ve finished my renovation, I suggest letting your design-build team know upfront what your priority is. For example, I was less focused on the timeline as long as the work was done correctly. And ask questions! Communication is critical and you don’t want to assume anything. </span></p>
<h3>Living in his junior one-bedroom during renovations</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I actually chose to live in my apartment throughout the renovation process. The only night I did not stay was the first day of demolition. I would not recommend this for everyone though. I was largely motivated to put the money I saved, from not renting a place for 1-2 months, back into the renovation. (I had originally thought my budget would be enough for a kitchen, bathroom, and wall; however, I had to remove the bathroom from the scope upfront.) My contractor was very accommodating as this was likely a nuisance for him to clear a path for me to walk in and out to my bed every day. It was clear to me throughout the renovation process that my design-build team wanted me to be happy with the finished product. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I wasn’t able to find the perfect one-bedroom at first, and I learned that nothing will be perfect, but I am extremely satisfied with the end result while staying within budget. Now, I’m proud to call the apartment my home and, even though I set out to live alone, my next plan is to adopt a dog or cat.</span></p>

<h3>Renovation FAQ</h3>
<h4><span>What is a junior one-bedroom apartment?</span></h4>
<p><span>A junior one-bedroom apartment is a studio apartment that has a partial wall that blocks off an area of the apartment. This allows for the apartment to be compartmentalized and helps create a more organized layout. A junior one-bedroom apartment can be an affordable option for someone looking to live on their own and who wants a studio with additional privacy.</span></p>
<h4>How to remodel a junior one-bedroom apartment</h4>
<p><span>Looking to renovate your junior one-bedroom apartment while keeping costs down? A recommended approach is to convert a junior one-bedroom apartment into a true one-bedroom apartment layout. Because junior one-bedrooms have partial walls, the walls show where the room can be created and closed off by completing the wall line. Additionally, simply closing off the wall allows for fewer structural changes overall, or the need to rethink the entire apartment layout. </span></p>
