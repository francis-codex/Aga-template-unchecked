										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Want to know how to close projects? Establish trust with your clients and explain your estimate.</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49345" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GCFacing-BookJob-2.jpg" alt="booking renovation" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GCFacing-BookJob-2.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GCFacing-BookJob-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GCFacing-BookJob-2-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Success depends on that one signature. In this guide, Sweeten shares key tips to how to smooth the process to close projects and getting signed contracts. These practices will reduce time and effort for you while reducing anxiety for the homeowner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Establish a process and communicate it early</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’re the pro—it’s up to <em>you</em> to know everything you’ll need from the client, and when you’ll need it. Having an established process will help you show confidence and authority, which earns confidence from clients. You may find it helpful to map out the process in writing, even if those notes are just for your own use.</span></p>
<p>If you sense you’re getting positive feedback from the client, you can start discussing next steps as early as the site visit. At the latest, you’ll want to start these discussions when you deliver your estimate.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Communicate clearly and transparently</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t be shy about discussing your process with the homeowner. Most clients, especially first-time renovators, will be comforted by a confident contractor who leads them through the process. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some GCs avoid bringing up critical steps, like contracts and payment plans, out of fear that this will scare the homeowner away. Don’t fall into this trap! It’s always better to be upfront. Your transparency inspires confidence and will help you avoid springing surprises on the homeowner at the last minute. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Consider these points:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Are you asking for a large payment upfront? </span>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">If yes, explain why—for example, to order materials early and avoid delays, to secure your crew, etc. Conversely, if your payment schedule is flexible or you are asking for a relatively low percentage upfront, use that as a selling point.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Will you take care of permits? If so, which ones? Will there be any costs associated with this work? </span>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Be sure to clearly communicate what will be on the homeowner’s plate to manage and pay for versus what you are providing as value-added services.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Encourage questions! </span>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Homeowners appreciate the opportunity to learn from you and a healthy dialogue gives you the chance to demonstrate your expertise and listening skills. An informed client is a good client.</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Some questions to be prepared for:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><i></i><span class="s3"><i>Can you revise the estimate (itemizing, reorganizing, taking things out, or adding additional line items in, etc.)?<br />
</i></span><span class="s1">Be sure to set boundaries. Let the client know how many revisions you&#8217;re willing to make.</span></li>
<li class="li4"><i></i><span class="s3"><i>Is the estimate negotiable?<br />
</i></span><span class="s5">Emphasize that you&#8217;ll work with them on revising their project scope to fit the budget. Set limits on how much time you&#8217;ll invest for free without a commitment.</span></li>
<li class="li4"><i></i><span class="s3"><i>Can I get a discount?<br />
</i></span><span class="s1">Here it&#8217;s usually best to stand behind your work, and emphasize that you&#8217;ve already made your bid as competitive as possible. But make sure this is the truth! It&#8217;s always best to start with a competitive bid than with a high or low estimate or other sales gimmick. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Explain the contract</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before you send the contract, let the homeowner know what to expect beforehand.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Will you send a digital contract or paper one? </span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li><span class="s3"><em>Pro Tip: Most clients prefer digital documentation. Use Sweeten&#8217;s e-signature feature to get contracts signed faster. </em></span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Tell the homeowner that you’re comfortable with answering their questions about your contract.</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">If you use a standard boilerplate contract, send it with your estimate—don’t wait for the client to beg!</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">If you include your contract with the estimate, be sure to remind the client that it’s there.</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Always include a time limit in your contract— &#8220;This estimate is good for 60 days,&#8221; etc. Make sure the client understands this. This speeds the process along, and protects you from a client showing up years later expecting the same deal.</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">In summary</span></h3>
<p class="p1">Knowing how to close projects with clients takes practice and care. <span class="s1">Always think about what you can do to inspire confidence and trust. Taking the lead, being open and honest, transparent in your communications, and clearly explaining your contract will all help you win the client’s trust—and win the job.</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Grow your contracting business by following these easy steps on Facebook and Instagram</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44674" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having social media business pages enables business owners like yourself to easily grow your contracting business. These accounts will help you to establish a custom online presence in communities where your past and potential clients already spend their time. Whether you have already created pages or you are looking to start from scratch, business pages allow your audience to easily find your company, increasing the credibility of your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, </span><span class="s1">a service that connects qualified <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/signup/expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractors, builders, and remodelers</a> with homeowners and design professionals with renovation projects, offers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this guide to help you establish an online presence. When speaking with clients, frequently referenced sites include Facebook and Instagram. Pulling together cohesive messaging and showcasing past projects on these platforms can help give your firm a leg up. Ready to grow your business’s presence on social media? </span></p>
<h3><strong>Facebook Updates to Grow Your Contracting Business</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Establish your profile</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before creating a Facebook business page, you must establish an individual profile on Facebook if you do not have one already. You can use an existing individual profile to create a page for your contracting business or start a new individual profile specifically for the purposes of setting up your company page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that there is some overlap in login information between company pages and individual profiles, so if you want team members to have access, it may make sense to start an individual account that is solely for business purposes. </span></p>
<p><strong>Create your business page (or clean it up!)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve established an individual profile, “Create a Page” for your business. Upload a Profile Picture and Cover Photo &#8212; pages with cover photos typically get more page likes and visits! Choose photos that showcase your work and that you’d be proud to have potential clients see. This is where you want to show your best work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you already have a profile, take some time to remove any content or posts that don’t support or strengthen your business profile. A good gut check is to ask yourself, would I show this photo to potential clients? If the answer is no, take it off your business page.</span></p>
<p><strong>Describe your services</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Description: Write a brief description that will appear in the search results. This is where you can let people know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">why </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">they should engage with your business and what neighborhoods you operate in. What are your specialties and in-house capabilities? How will you help clients achieve their goals? Evaluate this description once a year and consider using it across your online profiles including in your Sweeten company description! </span></p>
<p><strong>Use quality pictures that showcase past work</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should choose 3 or 4 projects (like you did to join Sweeten!) that showcase your strengths and the beautiful work that your company does to get your business page started. In general, post valuable content that will resonate with your audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have an awesome project underway? Post photos of in-progress projects or completed projects so your audience can get a taste of your work experience. Pick a few photos and write up a few sentences to describe the scope of work that you accomplished for each project. Again use that gut check, if you wouldn’t show the photo to potential clients &#8212; don’t upload it to your page.</span></p>
<p><strong>Promote your page</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You now have a Facebook business page that will give potential clients a feel for your firm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When people like your page, it&#8217;s easier for others to discover it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Use your other channels like your website or Sweeten profile to promote your page. You can even connect it with your firm’s Instagram account so you can update both simultaneously. Linking the page can be one way of minimizing upkeep, but remember to check in on the account at least every 6 months to make updates and add new photos of recent work.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Instagram</strong><strong> Updates to Grow Your Contracting Business</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Establish your account </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the Instagram app as there are many features not available on the desktop version of their site. Pick a username or “handle” that represents your business. Try to use some combination of your company name or initials and keywords for the industry (think “home,” “remodeling,” “GC,” “contractor,” etc.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you just signed up or already have a handle, switch the account to “professional” and review the privacy settings to set your account as public so potential clients can easily find your account. </span></p>
<p><strong>Define your business and a company bio</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add your company name so clients can identify or search for your firm. Write a brief company bio and try to stick to the 150 character limit. Include where you are based, and highlight your firm’s strengths, goals or accolades. </span></p>
<p><strong>Fill up the grid</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick at least nine photos that you are the proudest of to get your profile off the ground. Once you’ve filled up the initial grid, you’ll have a great base to build off of. If you already have an account, consider deleting any posts that don’t support the services you are trying to convey.</span></p>
<p><strong>Provide captions for your photos</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write a short caption for each posted photo to let clients know why that photo is significant. Don’t be afraid to use hashtags in the caption or tag other accounts in the photo. Engaging with other accounts through hashtags, tags, and comments can help others find and follow your account. You can also add geotags so potential clients can see the general location of any projects that you post. These features can be edited or updated at any time, so they’re ideal you’re looking to refresh old posts with photos.</span></p>
<p><strong>Follow others in your industry</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sweeten_home/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@sweeten_home on Instagram</a> and then follow any industry contacts that you might have, including designers, architects, subcontractors, or showrooms. Not only will this help you stay current on industry news or events, but it will also inform your explore page, which Instagram generates to help you find new accounts. </span></p>
<p>Follow these steps to enhance your social media business profiles and you&#8217;ll make great progress to grow your contracting business online.</p>
