<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>A ranch-style Georgia home with appeal</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We bought this 1958 home in Atlanta’s Buckhead section with plans to renovate right away. Nothing was wrong, per se, but we knew we wanted to remodel. The plan was to improve the layout and exterior façade and update the kitchen and bathrooms. A big project would also turn the primary bedroom into a true master suite.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21.jpg" alt="Den with fireplace, couches, chairs, grand piano, and hanging fan" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52190" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are Jenna and Hagan, now parents to two daughters: Clay, 2, and Sloan, 7 months. Henry, our dog, lives here, too. When we found the house, we were still expecting our second child and I was working from home due to the pandemic. More space and some rooms to relax in were all we could think about.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>A mid-century remodel focused on good bones with potential</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Our ranch-style home, in the Chastain Park neighborhood, comprises 3,000 square feet. It has a backyard with mature trees, and the house benefits from pretty views and lots of natural light. The interior was traditionally styled, and we liked it. We felt, however, that we could make it work better for our family, and set out to do that. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and the team quickly sourced four quality contractors for us to consider. We soon <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6751#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a general contractor</a> who inspired our confidence. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23.jpg" alt="A view of the white painted brick fireplace from behind the tan couch" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52192" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22.jpg" alt="The grand piano in the renovated den with a large plant" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52191" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We brought floorplans to our meetings, as layout changes were the most challenging part of the project. Our house had a lot of storage space that we saw a potential to put to better use. These would include the bedroom areas as well as more useful spaces for the kitchen area.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the den, our contractor removed a large built-in shelf that had started to separate from the wall. We also painted this room and stained the floor dark brown.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20.jpg" alt="View into the two doors to the living areas from the entryway" width="1000" height="1545" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52189" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20-194x300.jpg 194w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20-583x900.jpg 583w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">&#8220;The contractor replaced the windows top to bottom to improve insulation. We could see early signs of rotting wood in the old windows.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A new bay window brightens the kitchen</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The plan for the kitchen included putting in a bay window in the existing breakfast nook and installing Dolomite marble countertops. We ordered a new kitchen sink and added a subway tile backsplash. We kept the existing cabinets, switching out the knobs for a fast refresh. To increase function in this section of the house, we turned to old closets. Opening up the boxed-in space of the four lining the back hallway made space for a butler’s pantry with a second fridge. We also built a laundry room in this area in a follow-up to the larger renovation. </span></p>

<h3>Transforming closets for a master suite</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the back of the house, closets (again) and one of the offices gave their square footage to enlarge our master suite and another bedroom. For the master suite, we imagined a large, open bedroom area looking out into the backyard. We would also add a walk-in closet, a big bathroom, and a powder room. The remap worked brilliantly. An existing door was repurposed as a sliding barn door and leads to our master walk-in closet. The contractor built a secret door at its back that lets us quickly get to the kids’ bedrooms during the night. It has come in handy!</span></p>

<h3 class="p4">Three bathrooms with new tile</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bathroom renovations came next. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/how-to-save-on-home-remodeling-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We did them economically</a>—as in almost simultaneously. Each bath got new tile, though we retained usable fixtures and hardware</span><span class="s1"> where we could. At one point, we had three bathrooms torn up. The one in use had a shower only, and our two-year-old was terrified of showers! We were pleased when the child’s bathroom, replete with new tub and penny tile floor, was finished—not to mention the other three. Our beautiful master bath, with a freestanding fluted bathtub, a glass-walled shower, and double sinks got the full marble treatment. The color palette was a mix of gray and white, including sleek large-sheet floor tiles</span><span class="s1">. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15.jpg" alt="Bathroom with light blue walls, white floors, white shower curtain, and decorative mirror" width="1000" height="668" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52186" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Whole-house improvements for curb appeal</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Much of the house had hardwood flooring in need of refinishing. From the bedrooms to the living room, den, foyer, and kitchen, the contractors sanded and stained them. In another global redo, the contractor replaced the windows top to bottom to improve insulation. We could see early signs of rotting wood in the old windows. The new kitchen bay window </span><span class="s1">looks great from the inside and <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/curb-appeal-goes-a-long-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhances the home’s curb appeal</a>. The house would also get a new coat of exterior paint. </span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A Sweeten general contractor to count on</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Through it all, our Sweeten contractor was reliable and competent. He was diligent with the permitting process, a delay-ridden challenge during Covid. (Key takeaway: Be 100 percent sure you need a permit and factor it into your timeline!) Our contractor was transparent on costs, and his efforts resulted in a pleasing final product.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It’s been a feat, but finally, we feel settled. Jenna and I waited so long for our master suite—it feels magical to have our own space. The girls, and Henry the dog, are happy. We are home.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s easy to save on remodeling costs in Atlanta when you know a few tricks</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49255 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen and dining area" width="1600" height="1068" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta.jpg 1600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You love your home, and you love living in Atlanta. But there may be <em>some</em> parts of your home that you don&#8217;t love. Or maybe you just bought a new home, and you know you want to update it to suit you. We see renovation projects in Atlanta at a wide range of costs. Often, homeowners want to maximize their scope on a minimal budget. Luckily, there are a handful of tricks that can help you save on remodeling in Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Remodel smaller and smarter</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For years, one of the draws of living in Atlanta was that you could own a large house for the same—or less than—what you would pay in northern cities. Atlanta <a href="https://atlanta.curbed.com/2018/10/3/17931250/lending-tree-report-atlanta-houston-biggest-houses-nation"><span class="s2">ranks number two</span></a> in the United States in home sizes. In fact, Atlanta’s average home size is just under 2,000 square feet. But sprawl has its price, which means large homes and large remodels come with higher costs. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Find ways to remodel that don’t involve creating a new foundation or building upward. If you can, stay within the existing footprint of the house. Explore rooms that are no longer used for their intended purpose and convert them. Tour the house with your contractor and find walls that you can open to expand two rooms into one large room.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Look into Atlanta&#8217;s green remodeling incentives</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Green or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eco-friendly remodeling</a> helps the environment and can certainly help you save on remodeling in Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many homeowners may not realize that they can take advantage of a host of <a href="https://www.nariatlanta.org/green-remodeling"><span class="s2">green remodeling incentives</span></a>. These incentives can reduce the cost of remodeling. Some of the incentives include tax credits, loan programs, tax exemptions, and rebates.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Speak to your contractor about your interest in green remodeling. You may also want to have an energy audit done before remodeling begins.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Tailor the HVAC to Atlanta&#8217;s weather</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Heating and cooling are different in Atlanta than in other cities. Systems that work in Chicago, Los Angeles, or New York aren’t always applicable in Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In a city with fewer than 50 days per year below freezing, Atlanta homes don&#8217;t need the kind of robust furnaces or heat pumps found in other areas of the country. And maxing out your A/C isn’t always the answer, either! Your A/C should be tailored specifically to Atlanta’s weather and to your own house. Also, it&#8217;s smart to explore passive cooling methods with your contractor.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Make use of Georgia’s solar power and natural light</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Atlanta is one of the sunniest cities in the United States, with at least 60% of the days per year being sunny. Use this to your advantage! Concentrate on improving windows on the south side of your house. Rooms that have plenty of large windows rely less on artificial light. This saves money on electricians’ costs and on the cost of extensive artificial lighting. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At the same time, make sure that these windows have low-e solar coating. Add draperies to block sun during the brightest part of the day.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Remodel with mold in mind</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Atlanta can get humid—extremely humid. Humidity that reaches 55% or more can lead to mold growth. Poorly vented crawlspaces, basements, and rooms are susceptible to mold growth. Not all mold is dangerous. However, some mold can be a lung irritant and can affect those with respiratory ailments.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Good remodeling work can be quickly undone by mold. To avoid mold growth, talk to your contractor about mold-inhibiting wall and ceiling systems, along with venting systems.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Refurbish, don’t replace</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The days of tearing out everything and replacing it wholesale are long gone. Now, there is a smarter approach to remodeling that incorporates fixing items, not throwing them out. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For example, you may decide to reface, rather than replace, your kitchen cabinets. Refurbishing cabinets, tubs, showers, floors, walls, and more keep these items out of the landfill and make your Atlanta remodel more affordable. </span></p>
<p><em>Considering new doors for your kitchen cabinets? Get the lowdown on <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/the-411-on-kitchen-cabinet-door-designs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different cabinet door styles.</a></em></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">DIY projects in an Atlanta remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Not all of the work of your home remodel project needs to be done by the contractor’s workers. You can do a few things yourself in advance, or during downtimes. Sweat equity helps you save on remodel costs and make it all more affordable. Always coordinate in advance with your contractor if you plan to do DIY work. (Here’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/diy-vs-contractor/"><span class="s2">what you can DIY</span></a> and what should be left to the pros!)</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Use durable imitation materials</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You might really want that exotic hardwood flooring, but the price of it isn&#8217;t within your budget. Look for wood-look ceramic tile planks that look just like mahogany or other overseas hardwoods. Laminate and vinyl plank also look remarkably like real wood. Quartz and laminate countertops reliably imitate expensive marbles and granites. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Wherever there is an expensive material, there is likely a far less expensive imitation material that you can use in your remodel.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Keep the plumbing in place</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One rule of thumb for keeping bathroom and kitchen remodeling affordable: avoid moving the plumbing, if possible.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Whenever you move plumbing around, remodel costs rise. This doesn&#8217;t mean that you cannot change your shower, bathtub, or sink. You <i>can</i> replace or refurbish these items while keeping the core plumbing system where it is</span><span class="s3">.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Shop around for the best contractor</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Finding the best contractor for a remodeling project in Atlanta isn&#8217;t about finding the cheapest person. Instead, it&#8217;s about finding a person who can best bring your vision to light. </span><span class="s1">Concentrate on finding a contractor who best matches your needs. You’ll also want to find a contractor who you work with well, and who you communicate well with. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Get on the general contractor’s schedule—now</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When you sign with a contractor for a home remodeling project, the contractor places you on their calendar. Being in the early queue means getting ahead of other clients, especially when there is overall high demand for home remodeling, labor, and materials. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Ask your expert for remodeling advice</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One of the upsides of hiring a general contractor is that you can take advantage of their knowledge and expertise. </span><span class="s1">Feel free to ask for their advice&#8230;that’s why you hired them! Contractors can have years or decades of experience in construction and the right one will help you match your scope to your budget.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Deciding to </span><span class="s1">remodel an uncomfortable small bathroom</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We initially looked for a move-in-ready home, but didn&#8217;t find many in our budget in Clarkson where we wanted to live. The bathrooms in our new split-level house were built in 1982. They would need to be remodeled eventually but we’d tackle them as we could afford them. Three ye</span><span class="s2">ars later and with a toddler in our midst, we were ready. The master bathroom would be our first big project.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We had many problems with the original en-suite bathroom. Mainly, it was hideous. I disliked the color scheme on the wall, the warped laminate vanity, and the stick-on floor tiles. Not only was the pattern terrible, but the tiles were coming unglued. The plastic-insert shower was the worst offender. It was small and claustrophobic, and no amount of scrubbing would remove the mold and mildew stains. Even if it was just cleaned, the bathroom still felt dirty. I couldn’t stand showering in there.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">The search for a compatible contractor in Atlanta</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I’d already gotten a few estimates, but we were looking to work with a Black-owned contracting firm and hadn’t found one with availability. In addition, not many contractors want to take on a small space bathroom renovation, not to mention on a minuscule budget. Then I stumbled on a Sweeten blog post featuring <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/support-black-owned-general-contractor-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black-owned general contractors</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted my project</a> on Sweeten and found one that was also a <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woman-owned general contracting firm</a>. I felt really good about her, and she was willing to squeeze us into her schedule.</span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Finding solutions on a shoestring budget</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As first-time renovators, our biggest question was, “What does a bathroom remodel cost?” We had a limited budget and no idea what was reasonable. Our budget was $5,000, but quickly realized how below the average cost it was. We would have had to cut too many corners. We couldn&#8217;t afford to change the floorplan, so we agreed on the goal of transforming the bathroom into a pleasant, relaxing space. As a result, I decided to save money by designing the bathroom myself and doing it around an existing light fixture.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A crash course in a small bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I started gathering bathroom remodeling ideas on Pinterest and making a vision board. We considered replacing the shower insert to keep costs down, but the contractor said it would just get gross again. I had no idea what went into building and tiling a walk-in shower. First, I found out it costs a lot more to install mosaic subway tile than larger tile. In addition, I learned that a shower floor’s drainage slope requires mosaic tile, and the ones that come in sheets require less labor. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10.jpg" alt="bathroom remodel Atlanta with subway shower tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48171" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48169 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8.jpg" alt="in-shower storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With so many types of tile out there, we were glad to have the options narrowed for us. We chose large-format ceramic tile for the shower walls and hexagonal mosaic tile for the shower floor—in marble—as I wanted just one aspect to be luxurious. Even with the thoughtful choices, the materials and labor were costly. We gave up replastering the walls, removing the stippling from the ceiling, and installing a recessed light in the shower, all to keep costs down. We even kept the existing toilet, since it was fine.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Coaching and seeking economy</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There were moments when I felt like, “We just can’t afford to do this the right way,” but our Sweeten contractor helped us identify projects we could do ourselves (caulking holes and repairing molding). </span><span class="s1">We chose inexpensive bathroom flooring for the room. An inexpensive vanity helped, and I found the mirror at a discount home store for around $30. Consequently, we saved money and used quality materials where they mattered. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor provided great input and direction—including talking me out of some bad tile choices and kindly suggesting bright, simple colors and patterns. She never took over the vision. She was organized and communicative, and we appreciated her helping us stay (almost) within our revised budget, even after plumbing issues popped up.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48289 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2.jpeg" alt="color in bathroom" width="2048" height="1365" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2.jpeg 2048w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">The final budget—and excellent outcome</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">All told, we more than doubled the original budget (thanks to our family for the generous gift!) coming in just at the starting minimum <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost for a bathroom remodel</a> in Atlanta. This included labor, materials, random plumbing parts, and a zillion trips to Home Depot for the paint and other stuff I did on my own.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The final result feels larger and is the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spa bathroom</a> of my dreams. It’s so serene. My first bathroom with a walk-in shower and a natural stone floor, both of which feel truly luxe. It’s so lovely to step in there now. Everything is well-installed and of good quality. It’s exactly what we hoped for.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45208 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Atlanta-GC_Justin.jpg" alt="atlanta renovate for resale" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Atlanta-GC_Justin.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Atlanta-GC_Justin-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Atlanta-GC_Justin-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Renovation in Roswell, Georgia by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6767#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Justin</a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Atlanta housing market is humming. The value of homes increased by over seven percent in 2019, according to data from <a href="https://www.redfin.com/city/30756/GA/Atlanta/housing-market"><span class="s2">Redfin</span></a>. It’s one of those American city’s that is revitalizing with the <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2020/03/30/atlanta-population-soars-by-730-000-now.html"><span class="s2">fourth-fastest growth rate</span></a> in the nation. As a result, Atlanta homeowners are increasingly planning for home improvements. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">If you’re thinking of prepping your house for sale, Sweeten outlines the top home improvements for the Atlanta market to get the best price and sell quickly. </span><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes renovations aren’t always about what you want but what the homeowner who comes after you might want. A good idea is to take a look at the style of spec homes. “They try to use elements that have a large appeal,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6763#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Lonny</a>, who is based in Atlanta. When looking at the styles around Atlanta for your home improvements, sticking with what’s popular is best for resale rather than involving your unique preferences. “There might be hundreds of choices for faucets, but 95 percent of people might go with three styles,” said Lonny. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Renovation projects to consider: </span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Change out the front door</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First impressions endure when selling your home. “It is crucial that your entranceway is well kept,” said Lonny. Sprucing up the front of your home could be as simple as adding a new front door. For one client, Lonny swapped out a plain door for a craftsman-style door along with matching shutters. “It really set the house apart,” he said. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. A fresh coat of paint </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Atlanta-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6767#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Justin</a> advises homeowners to think like makeup artists when accessing the front of their home ahead of a sale. “You’re not going to attract buyers if the windows are fogged up and the paint is chipping,” he said. Ensuring your house is clean and your paint fresh will go a long way in getting the best price, Justin said. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Replace the garage door</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Along with your actual front door, replacing your garage door is a quick and easy fix to improve your home’s value. A garage door replacement costs $3,663 on average for the Atlanta area, according to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">report</span></a>. Your home’s value is increased by more than 76 percent of that cost. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Invest in siding</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lonny often gets calls about siding replacement from homeowners who are planning to sell their home. New siding is a great investment, according to the 2020 Cost Vs Value <span class="s2">report</span> for Atlanta. A project that installs fiber-cement siding costs an average of $17,000. Over $13,000 or 78 percent of the project’s cost is returned to you in the value that it adds to the home. That’s one of the highest returns on investment of any renovation project, according to the report. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">5. Basement as living space</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The basement is the first thing Justin looks at if a client is planning to resell their home. An unfinished basement has the potential to significantly <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-basement-turns-into-family-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase the square footage of your home</a>. “Finishing your basement is going to yield the largest return on your investment,” said Justin. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other alterations, such as a kitchen or bathroom remodel, are helpful, but they don’t add to the size of your home like a basement can. The square footage of your home and its price per square foot will feature prominently in your home’s sale listing. Depending on how many floors you have, a finished basement could almost double that square foot measurement.</span></p>
<p>A full basement renovation that includes budget-friendly floors, paint, lighting, and a half bath can start at $20,000. &#8220;<span class="s1">On the conservative side for finishes, a turn-key basement will cost around $50-65 per square foot to finish out,&#8221; said Justin. &#8220;This includes a small kitchen area and basement bathroom if all the rough-in plumbing is already installed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>A<span style="font-weight: 400;">ccording to the Cost Vs Value </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/">report</a>, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he average cost of a basement remodel in Atlanta was $70,000</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This increases a home’s value by $46,000 or more than 65 percent of the renovation’s cost, the report found.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">6. The bathroom adds value</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Giving your bathroom a makeover is an easy route to a higher house price. Recently, a real estate agent contacted Lonny with a house about to go on the market. To increase its value ahead of the sale, Lonny completed a modified gut renovation in the bathroom. “This was something that was needed because it was dated from the 1980s,” said Lonny. The customer had everything replaced except the cabinetry. The budget was about $20,000. A bathroom remodel in this budget range adds almost $13,000 —65 percent of the budget— to your home’s value, according to the Cost Vs Value <span class="s2">report</span> for Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you don’t have the time for a major remodel, then simple superficial changes might be a better option. This could mean swapping outdated fixtures like faucets for something more modern, said Lonny. A new countertop on your vanity could also spruce up your bathroom with minimum effort.  </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">7. A streamlined kitchen refresh</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kitchens are the gathering place, a focal point for any home. A kitchen could also make or break your home’s value, according to Justin. Rather than doing a full renovation that involves the costly exercise of changing a layout, stick to a scaled-back renovation. “A new countertop, backsplash, and faucet can go along way,” said Lonny. “If there’s the budget for it then I also suggest lighting and flooring.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cabinets, especially if they are custom-built, can take up a huge chunk of a budget. For a renovation that is geared towards increasing value, Lonny advised keeping cabinets as is. That way the budget and timeline can be streamlined. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A minor kitchen remodel with a budget of $23,000 has a high return on investment of 73 percent, according to the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">report</span></a>. A minor kitchen remodel in this instance involves replacing only the front of your cabinets, sink, faucet and countertops while adding an energy-efficient cooktop, oven, and refrigerator.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Give your home a fresh and neutral slate. Curb appeal gets the potential buyer to enter the door. A conservative palette inside allows them to more easily see how they can make the home their own. Take these home improvement ideas into consideration and be one step closer to closing the deal.</span></p>

<p>In a renovation journey that often starts with Pinterest boards for inspiration, the process to get to your dream space is exciting. It’s not without its twists and turns with something unexpected (the good and the bad). With safety and function in mind, this is the right time to make your home the way you want it. It’s good planning to have an idea of where hidden renovation costs may come up &#8211; from outdated wiring to soil stability.</p>
<p>These unseen bumps can increase the cost of your project and the time it takes to finish. Preparation can help with the hurdles. Atlanta general contractors from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, tell us what hidden renovation costs in Atlanta to watch for.</p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Hidden renovation cost: Upgrading electrical and plumbing</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There was a time for all cities where building renovations and new construction went unregulated. That meant no permits, no code of ethics, no insurance and no need to follow building codes. “People would hire someone solely based on price,” explains <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6745#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Kimberly</a> on how Atlanta construction once worked. A licensed contractor could do a job at a certain cost, “but an uncle’s friend can do it for $30.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Atlanta didn’t really button this all up tightly until about two decades ago. “Before that, there wasn’t much to hold a contractor’s feet to the fire,” Kimberly said. That means plenty of surprises when walls, floors, and ceilings of older homes open up. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A project Kimberly had worked on in an upscale neighborhood had live wires in the ceiling that connected to nothing. “It literally could have set the house on fire,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">These unforeseen problems can add to the cost of the project as well as the timeline. In another project, Kimberly’s client wanted an open plan living room and kitchen. Walls were removed. Once the demo started, the team discovered a drain stack inside one of the walls. The plumbing rerouted to add a week to the project’s timeline and about $4,000 to the cost. But these electrical and plumbing updates “will last forever until the next remodel,” she said. “</span><span class="s2">Each update has to follow the most current code at that time.” </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Hidden renovation cost: </span><span class="s1">Abating lead and asbestos </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It’s safe to assume that any home built before 1978 in Atlanta will have lead paint and asbestos. That’s unless the poisonous materials were removed at some stage. The US banned lead paint in 1978. It wasn’t until the late 1980s that building materials could no longer contain asbestos. The material is now federally regulated in Atlanta.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Before beginning a project on an older home, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6670#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Dexter</a>, who is based in Atlanta, always tests for both of these substances. Handheld x-ray devices detect lead paint even if it is buried under layers of safe paint. Lead dust can also show up in swab tests that take a few days to process. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Asbestos can be found in paint, flooring, pipes, insulation, fireproof materials, and wiring. It can show up in dust samples. To isolate where the asbestos is located, samples of the materials previously mentioned are sent to a lab. Contractors need a specific license to test for either lead or asbestos. Some contractors, like Dexter, are licensed to do a small amount of lead testing.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What if lead or asbestos is found in your home? Either just the area you are disturbing (if it’s a smaller project) or your entire home will need to be abated. A licensed company should do the abatement. “I’ve seen homes abated and it took two to three weeks,” said Dexter. This can increase your costs by a few thousand dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“There is also an option to leave the asbestos where it’s found and left undisturbed,” he said. Despite the time delay and extra costs, “clients have a peace of mind knowing this has been abated properly,” said Dexter. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Hidden renovation cost: </span><span class="s1">Soil conditions in Atlanta</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hidden renovation costs start to show themselves when your project messes with Atlanta&#8217;s waterways, ridges, soils, and rock beds.</span><span class="s1"> Setting foundations in soil too soft can mean big issues later on as your deck or extension settles and shifts. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In order to complete an outdoor deck for a client, Kimberly drilled down triple the distance that was in the initial plan. At six feet, “the soil was gray indicating there was water there,” she said. The crew drilled down to 18 feet before they found soil suitable for the deck’s foundation. “It was an additional $12,000,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you have the space, consider that building an outdoor deck increases your living square footage. A typical wood deck addition will return 63% of your investment, and a 73% return on investment for composite material, according to Remodeling’s Cost vs Value 2020 <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/"><span class="s3">report</span></a>. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Hidden renovation cost: </span><span class="s1">Tree removal permits in Atlanta</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the City of Atlanta, removal of any tree with a trunk larger than 6” in diameter for hardwoods and 12” in diameter for pine requires <a href="https://www.atlantaga.gov/government/departments/city-planning/office-of-buildings/arborist-division"><span class="s3">approval</span></a>. An arborist from the city will inspect the tree and then issue a permit if it passes. It is tightly regulated to minimize the loss of a mature tree canopy. “Atlanta was a forest before it was a city,” said Sweeten expert Kimberly. “They are trying to keep clean air quality.” </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">If trees need to be removed, a well-thought-out site plan should show the trees and house and how its presence affects the future design. An explanation for why it needs to be removed is helpful. “There are a variety of permits issued by the City of Atlanta for tree removal,” said Kimberly, including it’s dead, diseased, or in a hazardous location.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The fee to remove a tree starts at $130. This money goes into the city’s Tree Trust Fund, which plants new trees and maintains existing ones. If your application to remove a tree for a renovation is denied, the plans will need to be modified. She suggests to apply for the tree removal permit first, otherwise your contractor will apply for it along with the building permit. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Hidden renovation cost: </span><span class="s1">Permits in Atlanta</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Atlanta is <a href="https://patch.com/georgia/atlanta/atlanta-named-8th-fastest-growing-large-city-america-study"><span class="s3">ranked 8th </span></a>in the United States for its growth rate amongst other large cities. That means a lot of new construction and renovations on existing homes as new owners move in. With so many permit applications for the Atlanta buildings department to process, the approvals can be unpredictable coming in as little as one day or 30 days for the same permit, according to Kimberly. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“It puts a damper on the timeline for homeowner and contractor,” she said. Having a design-build firm, general contractor, or an architect come early on in the process helps ensure complete documentation is ready for the permit application process. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Whatever complexities lay ahead in a renovation, understanding and preparing for hidden renovation costs common to Atlanta is a good starting point. Luckily, Sweeten can help you find the right vetted general contractor in Atlanta! You’ll be one step closer to your dream home. Enjoy the journey.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Atlanta </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s no denying Atlanta is a booming city. Between 2010 and 2018, Atlanta was the fourth-fastest growing city in the nation, adding a little less than 700,000 people and now sits at close to six million inhabitants. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In other words, it’s a great time to put down roots in Atlanta—from restoring a bungalow in Decatur, adding to a classic Georgian-style home in Druid Hill, or </span><span class="s2">remodeling</span><span class="s1"> a loft apartment in the Old Fourth Ward. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their project, offers this guide detailing costs to remodel in Atlanta as a starting point. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When embarking on a renovation, ‘How much will it cost?’ will likely be your first question. It’s notable in Atlanta that once a renovation budget reaches a couple $100,000s, building a new house instead becomes a major consideration. In this situation, you’ll need to factor in costs to tear down the existing structure and remove debris.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Read on for a breakdown of typical starting costs for remodeling across Atlanta, Georgia, focusing on five categories: full home, kitchen, bathroom, outdoor spaces, and permits.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Gut renovation: </span><span class="s3">Starting at around <strong>$70</strong>—<strong>$100 </strong></span><span class="s2">psf </span><span class="s1">(per square foot)<br /></span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$20,000</strong>—<strong>$30,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$35,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$65,000</strong></span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Budget bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$12,500</strong>—<strong>$15,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$20,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end bathroom remodel and reconfiguration: Starting at <strong>$35,000+</strong></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Deck</span><span class="s1"> composite: <strong>$20,000</strong> or <strong>$61</strong> psf<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Wood deck: <strong>$14,000</strong> or <strong>$44</strong> psf<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46402" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs-1.png" alt="Sweeten Find Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs-1.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs-1-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much an Atlanta home remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A total gut renovation in Atlanta that brings your home down to the studs and dresses it back up again with budget</span><span class="s3"> finishes will likely start at around <strong>$70</strong> to <strong>$100</strong> psf,</span><span class="s1"> according to Atlanta-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6670#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Dexter</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He recently worked on a renovation that redid everything except for the basement. “We renovated about 85 percent of this house,” said Dexter. It was a 1950s house that involved redoing the siding, repairing, and polishing the original wood floors, remodeling two bathrooms with a custom shower in one and new tub in the other while adding gold-look faucets and an oversized kitchen island with a farmhouse sink. Subsequently, by using high-end finishes and custom elements, that renovation came in <strong>$120,000</strong> for the end budget. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6745#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Kimberly</a> is currently working on a 3,200 square foot farmhouse renovation. The budget is at <strong>$150,000</strong>, which includes renovating three bathrooms and expanding the fourth for a larger master suite and a kitchen remodel that includes custom kitchen cabinets and quartz countertops. “We will be making some smart choices to make it look brand spanking new without breaking the budget,” said Kimberly, adding that the owners were rolling their sleeves up to do some work themselves to reduce the budget. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Kimberly is about to start demolition on the project which will reveal if any rewiring is needed to bring the old building up to code. One issue common in Atlanta’s older homes is subpar work that might have been completed previously by an unlicensed contractor. “The budget could go as high as <strong>$225,000</strong>,” she said, bringing the farmhouse reno to about <strong>$75</strong> psf.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition, another factor that can have a big impact on a budget for an extensive renovation is the age of the house and whether it had <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lead paint or asbestos</a>, according to Dexter. Anything built before 1978 could have lead paint in it. Anything built between the ‘30s and the end of the ‘80s could have asbestos. That’s why Dexter gets homes built in those time periods tested. Subsequently, if it comes back positive, the removal of lead or asbestos could add a few thousand dollars to your budget while pushing your timeline back.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48249 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Atlanta-RemodelingCosts-.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="740" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Atlanta-RemodelingCosts-.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Atlanta-RemodelingCosts--300x222.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Atlanta-RemodelingCosts--600x444.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much an Atlanta kitchen remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The typical quote detailing costs to remodel a minor kitchen in Atlanta ranges between <strong>$20,000</strong> to <strong>$30,000</strong> for a 200-square-foot space which</span><span class="s3"> includes labor and rough materials such as drywall</span><span class="s1">. This number doesn’t budge all that much because it is mostly calculated on installation rather than materials. </span><span class="s1">In a budget kitchen remodel, it’s a good idea to keep lighting where it is while refreshing the fixtures, according to Sweeten expert Kimberly. For a mid-grade to high-end budget, you should be able to change the location of lights. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additional material costs include elements such as replacing cabinet fronts, a basic granite countertop, basic lighting, energy-efficient appliances, faucets, and resilient flooring. For example, you could go for a good value kitchen appliance package with a dishwasher, fridge, microwave, and oven for <strong>$3,500</strong> from Home Depot. A similar package from high-end brands could set you back <strong>$20,000</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a look at some mid-grade to high-end kitchen costs:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen: Expect the average mid-grade kitchen renovation to come in around <strong>$175</strong> psf or <strong>$35,000</strong> for the Atlanta area. A 200-square-feet space would reveal laminate countertops, a 15-square-foot island, semi-custom wood cabinets, and a double stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet. It also contained a built-in microwave, dishwasher, and custom lighting. Keeping your layout the same will be the biggest factor in keeping your budget down.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen renovations came in at around <strong>$325</strong> psf or <strong>$65,000</strong>. A 200-square-foot kitchen would include custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported tile backsplashes. The appliances were also kicked up a few notches to include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood as well as high-end faucets and a water filtration system.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much an Atlanta bathroom remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a typical bathroom quote, expect the cost to come in </span><span class="s3">between <strong>$12,500</strong> to <strong>$15,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. The budget focuses on installation and does not include some key materials. This gives renovators the freedom to shop for what they want while having greater autonomy over their project’s budget. This cost range does include a vanity with a basic granite top, toilet, and tub or shower. Homeowners can shop for finishes such as faucets, tiles, and mirrors. For a project with a lower budget, Dexter advised renovators to stick to tiles in the <strong>$2</strong> psf range and faucets made from chrome or brushed nickel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a look at mid-grade to high-end bathroom budgets:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">In the Atlanta area, the average cost of a mid-grade kitchen remodel comes in about <strong>$20,000</strong> or <strong>$571</strong> psf. This range applies to a 35-square-feet space and installing a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. A renovation of this level can add about <strong>$13,000</strong> to a home’s value, which recoups close to 65 percent of the project’s cost, according to <i>Remodeling’</i>s Cost vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/"><span class="s7">report</span></a>. Not a bad investment.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A popular remodel is taking out the tubs to put in showers. However, avoiding this and working with the layout that you have can easily shave off <strong>$4,000</strong> in a bathroom budget. </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">The average bathroom remodel cost in the high-end category starts at around <strong>$35,000</strong>. For this budget, you could expand your bathroom from 35 square feet to around 100 square feet and can play around with elements like a freestanding soaker tub and a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. You’re also likely to afford a double-sink and double-mirror vanity with custom draws and wall cabinets. In Kimberly’s experience, a high-end bathroom remodel typically involves using marble or quartz, replacing a rod and shower curtain with glass and adding elements like double shower heads.</span></li>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Costs for adding outdoor space in Atlanta</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you don’t mind a bit of humidity, an outdoor area can be used year-round (although, a fan and mosquito netting is a smart addition for summer). <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Add or renovate your deck or patio</a> and it will be like adding another room to your home. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The average price for a 320-square-foot deck made from composite is <strong>$20,000</strong> or <strong>$61</strong> psf, according to the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s7">report</span></a> for 2020. Composite is a mix of wood and plastic, making it more durable to weather and termites than just wood. A project using this material will add about 60 percent of the cost back into your home’s value. If you do use wood, it will reduce your budget by more than 25 percent to <strong>$14,000</strong> or <strong>$44</strong> psf. A deck made with wood will add 70 percent of the project cost to your home’s value.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Consequently, the majority of Dexter’s clients go with a wood deck rather than composite. A recent client had him rebuild a deck and cover it with flyscreen. It was about 300 square feet and the job was done for a total of <strong>$20,000</strong> or about <strong>$65</strong> psf.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding stone to a concrete slab for a patio will start at about <strong>$12</strong> psf, according to Kimberly. If you want to add lighting and ceiling fans, then add another <strong>$5,000</strong> to your budget for fixtures and wiring. An outdoor kitchen could range from <strong>$5,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong>. “In Atlanta, people plan spaces for entertaining purposes,” said Kimberly.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Permit costs</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building permit fees are often calculated by the square footage of your project, or by the overall budget cost. To see how your area’s permits are calculated, check with your local building department. Your general contractor will likely put an estimated amount in your initial budget before a final amount is calculated. “There’s no rule of thumb when it comes to the cost of permits,” said Sweeten contractor Dexter. “Some areas I can pull a permit for <strong>$50</strong>, but the same job in another county could cost <strong>$200</strong>.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It isn’t just the cost of the actual permit that needs to go into the budget. Additionally, you also need to pay your contractors for the time it takes them to pull the permit. In some counties in Atlanta you can file electronically. Other counties, a contractor or architect will need to show up in person with paper plans, said Kimberly. A typical fee to have someone file your permits can range between <strong>$300</strong> and <strong>$1,000</strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <span class="s7">cost</span> of building permits for the city of Atlanta, the area including and immediately surrounding the downtown area, is <strong>$7</strong> per <strong>$1,000</strong> for construction. Electrical, plumbing, and mechanical permits also have their own fees, which start between <strong>$75</strong> and <strong>$175</strong> per project. Your general contractor will be familiar with the costs and will also be filing your building permits on your behalf.</span><span class="s8"> </span></p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">Atlanta homeowners can expect gut renovation costs in the range of $70 to $100 psf. This would bring an Atlanta-area home down to the studs and dress it back up with budget finishes. Gut renovation costs in Atlanta will increase when using luxury finishes, or for extensive rewiring or plumbing work. Also, the age of the house, as well as whether it has lead paint or asbestos, will impact gut renovation costs.</p>
