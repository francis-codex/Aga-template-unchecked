			<h2 class="p1">From efficient ADUs to spa-like bathrooms, home interior design in Los Angeles points to simplicity, utility, and going traditional</h2>
<p class="p2"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46811 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg" alt="bedroom remodel for actress Jaime Ray Newman los angeles" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">Diversity is king when it comes to home interior design in Los Angeles. The city has a sense of history, with styles spanning Spanish Colonial to Mission Revival, Beaux-Arts to Art Deco, Hollywood Regency to streamline 1930s modern. The desire to preserve those design styles is strong, as is the need to make homes liveable for today. H<span>ome renovation design trends in Los Angeles</span> and what rooms and features are important have shifted nationwide. Fortunately, for LA contractors and designers, remodeling has not missed a beat.</p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Top photo</em>) Sweeten renovators and actor Jaime Ray Newman and Guy Nattiv&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles home renovation</a></span></p>
<h3>Changes and challenges: Home interior design in Los Angeles</h3>
<p class="p2">“We didn’t really see much of a change,” said Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5968#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA general contractor Trevor</a>. “It&#8217;s just a redirect.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The challenge is more about materials shortages, delays, and rising costs</span><span class="s2">.</span> “The cost of lumber is affecting building,” said Trevor. Sheet plywood, for example, has jumped from $18 to around $50, he said. “People are asking for alternatives to lumber, like tin framing used in commercial.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">A renewed focus on outdoor living</h3>
<p class="p2">“A lot more people are fixing their exterior,” said Trevor. “People want to spend money on outdoor hardscapes, swimming pools. In LA, that’s where you spend 60 percent of your time.”</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.cozystylishchic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA-based designer Jeanne Chung</a> agreed. “It’s all about indoor-outdoor living,” she said. NanaWalls, which fold in and extend the indoor space out to patios, are very popular. “They double the square footage of eating and entertaining areas,” said Jeanne.</p>
<p class="p2">The bonus of adding windows, especially large ones to foster the indoor/outdoor connection is gaining more natural light.</p>
<p class="p2">Homeowners are also investing in <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor rooms</a>. Pools, water features, outdoor kitchens, firepits, and extensive seating and dining areas are high on wish lists. Materials are more organic, “definitely going back to nature.” Trevor is using a lot of textured cement, stamped, and honed finishes. “A salt finish really is big. With mid-century design, there’s a lot of tile work. We do ipe wood outdoors and a type of red hardwood that is slightly less hard than ipe, but about half the price.”</p>
<h3 class="p5">ADUs and additions for more square footage</h3>
<p class="p2">One rising trend for home interior design in Los Angeles is remodeling ADUs (accessory dwelling units). “It’s generating the <span style="color: #333333;">biggest buzz,” said <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor Trevor. </span>These detached structures, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often garages</a>, are repurposed as guest houses, rentals, or home offices.</p>
<p class="p2">Many of her clients are adding to the existing footprint. “They’re knocking out walls to create a little extra space, as in bathrooms, for example.”</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg" alt="Modern living room with glass walls and modern gray fireplace" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirsty and David&#8217;s</a> Mid-City/Miracle Mile home in LA</span></p>
<p class="p2">“You can build a second story,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “It’s contingent on the footprint of the existing structure. A lot are pushed outside of the setback, so they go high vertically. People are going for the max. It’s getting a lot of value on the price for square foot.” If you&#8217;re planning on expanding or remodeling a kitchen or bathroom (more on them below), look for a vetted general contractor that is licensed. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor in LA</a> with experience will guide you through the process.</p>
<h3>Keeping kitchens fresh and updated</h3>
<p class="p6">“It’s where you get the most <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bang for the buck</a>,” said Trevor. The remodel here may happen more frequently than in other parts of the country. Apparently, design fatigue sets in earlier. He has <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to kitchens</a> remodeled just two years before for a refresh. “It’s like changing wardrobes.”</p>
<p class="p2">LA kitchens tend to be large, mostly open plan, and gourmet with top-of-the-line professional appliances. But there’s not as much carving, ornate moldings, over-the-top use of stones. Instead, there’s more of a creative mix of materials. At the same time, the goal is more making it your own with custom looks—tile backsplashes, bold color ranges, and stove hoods.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="geometric-pattern-black-white-backsplash-tiles" class="alignnone wp-image-50846 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass.jpg" alt="peninsula island in kitchen with white marble countertop and undermount sink with gold faucet and fixtures and pendant lights and black kitchen cabinets and geometric pattern black white backsplash tiles and vent over cooking range after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h4>Top kitchen materials to watch</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Cabinets. Simple clean-lined styles are flat-panel and frameless. Hardware is modern, sculptural, or jewelry-like. Otherwise, there are hidden touch latches. Wood is finding competition in painted finishes, mostly in soothing livable shades.</li>
<li class="p2">Island culture. Some islands are getting bigger, some are multi-level for different functions. Waterfall sides on islands are popular.</li>
<li class="p2">Appliances. Pro-style ranges favor stylish brands like cooktops and ovens from Wolf, Monogram by GE, LaCornue, and Lacanche. The desire to cook healthy promotes features like special burners for woks, steam cooking. Some ranges even have an integrated sous vide. The slow cooking in a vacuum-sealed bag retains more nutrients, uses less oil, fat, and salt.</li>
<li class="p2">Porcelain and quartz are gaining in popularity because of the similar looks to stone without the maintenance. Large slabs and large format tiles offer a seamless installation with no grout lines to break up the design. Matte finishes have overtaken shiny ones.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">“Here in LA, my clients don’t want polished,” said Jeanne. “I am using concrete-looking porcelain slabs and cement tiles.” Jeanne seals her concrete to guard against staining because it’s pretty porous.</p>
<h4>Finishes lead the way</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Color is taking a turn. Moody, dark colors—black, deep blues, and bottle greens—are ramping up, said Sweeten contractor Trevor. They pair well with burnished or brushed gold. “I do a lot of antiqued blue—like a muted denim—with brass pulls,” he said.</li>
<li class="p2">Lighter woods seem to suit the lighter mood of interiors. That goes for cabinets as well as flooring. Wide plank wood floors are on trend—with an average of 7&#8243;—and in French oak whitewashed finishes, cappuccino, some with a hint of gray.</li>
<li class="p2">Gold touch. LA homeowners are opting more for burnished and brushed gold finishes in cabinet hardware, faucets, and lighting. Some appliance manufacturers now include brass pulls as options. But mixing gold, especially with black matte, is very chic. Mixing metals adds interest to the design, especially in kitchens, where there is a lot of cabinetry.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">The spa bath is redefined</h3>
<p class="p2">In Los Angeles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgrading the whole bathroom</a> means incorporating a level of comfort. Freestanding tubs provide a visual <i>tour de force</i>. Most often they are made of stone, porcelain, quartz, or resin, so the shape lends a sculptural note. Large curbless walk-in showers are distinguished with surface materials. Linear drains are trending because they are more aesthetically pleasing. Rain showers are favored, but you won’t find multiple showerheads due to water restrictions. Floors often are radiant heated.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="gray-vanity-marble-countertop-hanging-mirror" class="alignnone wp-image-50847 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918.jpg" alt="large gray single vanity with white marble countertop and brushed nickel hardware and gold faucet and fixtures and hanging circular mirror infront of window after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Variations of brass finishes in this LA renovation by designer Jeanne Chung. Photos by Peter Christiansen Valli. </span></p>
<p class="p2">The divide—choosing between tub and shower—is more about personal preferences. Many see the sculptural artistry of the tub as adding to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return on investment</a>. Radiant heat is also a value-added. An alternative to slab stone walls is large-format porcelain tile. These tiles, with a range of looks that mimic various stones, come in similar slab formats.</p>
<p class="p2">More than ever, the bath is <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered an oasis</a>. The overall style may be elegant, but again, the overall look is simplified, with cleaner, more modern lines.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Ensuite bedrooms are preferred to mega-size closets</h3>
<p class="p2">Jeanne said her clients would rather have larger bedrooms with sitting areas than supersized closets. Still, walk-in closets are on remodeling wish lists.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Storage is key</h3>
<p class="p2">Unseen compartments in drawers or cubbies in cabinetry and built-in benches corral stuff to keep spaces visually clean.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49429 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg" alt="Modern kitchen with exposed beams and stacked washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy and Kevin&#8217;s</a> Westchester home in LA</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Mudrooms are still going strong</h3>
<p class="p2">Although some trend forecasters suggest the demise of these transitional spaces for hanging coats and dropping gear, Jeanne said not so in LA. “Especially with the pandemic,” she said, “There’s a desire for bigger mudrooms. It’s like a decontamination area—coming into the home, taking off all your grimy stuff.” Typical layouts include hanging storage behind doors, cubbies, and benches for putting on shoes or boots. Some incorporate pet stations.</p>
<h3 class="p2">There’s an uptick in requests for libraries</h3>
<p class="p2">“It’s a very popular room right now,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “It’s only going to get more popular. I’ve had three customers recently tell me they want libraries—real traditional, with everything built in.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">Home offices are making a comeback</h3>
<p class="p2">The Zoom fatigue is real, but so is the realization that the backdrop for those visual calls needs to step up. Jeanne recently had a request from a wife to make her husband’s office more fashionable—because of his frequent video calls.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Ongoing remodeling trends consistent in LA</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li class="p2">Going green and sustainability is much more in demand with a more conscious effort to utilize eco-friendly materials as well as those that save energy.</li>
<li class="p2">Smart home. Automation adjusts to temperature, lighting, and security. Smart devices even monitor cooking.</li>
<li class="p2">A few things to consider when remodeling in LA: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seismic codes</a> that require tall stem walls, slab on grade with thick foundations in order to guard against earthquake damage. Also, water restriction dictates the kinds of showers allowed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" class="elementor-button-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Find a contractor</span></a></p>
<h3 class="p2">Classic and traditional design emerges</h3>
<p>For home interior design in Los Angeles, Trevor also said that there appears to be a return to more traditional design.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p2">“Mid-century modern has always been huge like ranch home designs,” he said. &#8220;But traditional design is coming back—I would call it a mix between mid-century, Dutch, and American traditional. Recently I’ve been seeing yellow and some of the 70s colors coming back.”</li>
<li class="p2">Statement decorating is hot. It’s part of the remodel plan. It could be a feature wall, a painted mural, or wallcovering. It could be a pop of color in a professional range or a graphic patterned tile on a backsplash. Outdoors, it might be a pergola, water, or fire feature.</li>
<li class="p2">There’s an appreciation for artisanal looks. Handmade tiles, handcrafted hardware lend personality to interiors. Some renovation inspiration comes from restaurant and hotel design.</li>
<li class="p2">“Simplicity—we’re definitely going in that direction,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “Not so much baroque-style with lots of moldings. People are going functional. They want hip and stylish.” There’s a minimalist sensibility, but not in the spare extreme.</li>
<li class="p2">California style—with a modern or rustic refined look—still is strong, with lighter bleached look woods and ceiling beams.</li>
</ul>

<span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner Michelle and Nate&#8217;s <a style="color: #76808f;" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deck renovation</a> in Greenpoint, Brooklyn</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Serving as either an open gathering place or a cozy retreat, the deck has become a popular alternative to the patio and porch. Outdoor deck materials have improved in durability and beauty, with a range of types to choose from. Rather than choosing based on looks alone, it&#8217;s useful to know the pros and cons of the most common material options available.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Importance of the deck&#8217;s foundation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No matter how you design it or outfit it with planters and pergolas, at its essence the deck is a large outdoor platform. Typically, it is connected to the house, and raised from the ground anywhere from a few inches to several feet. This is in contrast to a patio, which is made of stone or concrete and set into the earth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though made from moisture-resistant or repellent material, decks should be isolated from the ground by supports set into concrete footers. Contact with soil will eventually rot any kind of wood. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Decking boards come in specially milled or manufactured sizes that are typically 2-by-4s, though widths can vary from a given manufacturer to provide you with more design options. Look for rounded edges that resist splintering.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will find many choices for joining systems. Some systems conceal screw heads, for a cleaner appearance and and to keep water from seeping into screw holes. Other systems are designed to allow expansion and contraction of the boards. “Decking boards with slotted sides can be installed using a clip system, so you do not have to surface fasten the boards,” says Doug L. Mucher, Senior Marketing Manager for <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/decking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CertainTeed</a>. “This provides a cleaner installation.”</p>

<h3>Zoning and local codes for outdoor decks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To ensure your deck is in compliance, deck supports are best installed by an experienced contractor who knows the local codes and zoning laws. Some cities or counties require approval from the planning commission and inspections during the building process. Keep in mind: these rules might limit your grand plans, or require some creative adaptations. It&#8217;s wise to consult with your contractor before proceeding with the build. “Most homeowners can handle replacing the deck surface,” says Mucher. “However, if the project requires the deck substructure to be built as well, you’ll most likely want to hire a contractor. A contractor can be required to make sure it is built to code.”</p>
<h3>How to choose outdoor deck materials</h3>
<p>Your choice of outdoor deck materials will be driven by your lifestyle, taste, and local climate. Does your area get a lot of rain and humidity? Heat and sun? Most modern deck materials can withstand any climate, but some require more upkeep than others to stay in good shape and appearance, especially in harsher climates.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Different types of outdoor deck materials</h3>
<p>Wood continues to be a popular choice. If you like classic materials, you can choose from a range of softwoods and hardwoods. You&#8217;ll get good-to-great performance, as long as you follow a regular maintenance routine. There are some synthetic alternatives, too. Consider the following:</p>
<h4>Pressure-treated pine hardwood</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: This is an inexpensive softwood that&#8217;s been impregnated with chemical preservatives, making it more resistant to insects and to splitting, swelling, and rot from humidity than other woods. It&#8217;s easy to paint. It&#8217;s also strong, and well-suited to the structural parts of the deck, even if you choose different woods for the deck surface and other visible elements. Pressure-treated pine is the thriftiest option, so it&#8217;s good for homeowners on a strict budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: It is a natural material and requires frequent maintenance to assure top performance. Pressure-treated pine is not as attractive as some other popular wood options, including cedar or redwood. As with all real wood, it can splinter. Upkeep includes deep cleaning and application of a lumber preservative annually as well as occasional sanding. The chemicals used in the pressure treatment are toxic. This isn&#8217;t typically a problem in an outdoor setting, but some homeowners prefer to keep this treated wood in places like the deck&#8217;s support structure, where they won&#8217;t have to come in direct contact with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $1.50 per square foot.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg" alt="Small backyard deck with inbuilt seating and brick wall background after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-50575 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h4>Non-treated wood</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: There’s a reason why many synthetic decking materials simulate the look of wood. There is nothing like this natural material for its warmth and expression of quality. The most popular softwood species are cedar and redwood, for their good looks and natural moisture resistance. Natural tannins and oils resist insects well, and these woods are easy to stain, paint, and seal. Some decks are built with tropical hardwoods, such as ipe, which are incredibly resilient, and in some cases are accepted by fire codes that otherwise require concrete.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: Even hardwoods are not as long-lasting as plastics. Wood can dent, split, splinter, fade, and require frequent upkeep to maintain the best appearance and life. You will need to not only wash with a wood cleaner or pressure-washer, but also seal it at least once annually. Best to sweep daily or weekly to avoid damage from gritty dirt. Darker shades will heat up in sunlight, making them unpleasant underfoot in the summer when you are likely to spend the most time there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $4 per square foot for cedar; from $6 per square foot for redwood, $8 per square foot for ipe.</p>
<h4>Composite</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: Made from wood fibers bound by a resin, synthetic decking is nearly maintenance-free. It will not warp, splinter, or rot, and it repels insects. It requires no stain or sealing and offers a wide selection of simulated wood looks and colors. It also can be molded and so lends itself to curved shapes. It requires little care except cleaning with soapy water and a soft-bristle brush.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: Surfaces in darker colors can become hot in the sun and may fade over time. It can melt if exposed to high heat, such as from a grill. Scratches can’t be buffed out, and dropped greasy foods might leave stains. It will not break down in a landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $5 per square foot.</p>
<h4>PVC</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is a thermoplastic that can be shaped and formed into a variety of products including decking. A particularly hard plastic, it won’t scratch, warp, rot, split, or stain; it’s lightweight and easy to install and requires no annual treatments other than cleaning with soap and water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: More limited palette than composite. It will not break down in a landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $4 per square foot.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Vinyl</h4>
<p>PRO: Lightweight vinyl is comprised of PVC and polyethylene. Available in faux-wood styles and textures, this material is easy to install thanks to its light weight and ease of slicing with a saw. It never needs painting, resists staining and fading, and won’t heat up, unlike natural wood and some composites. Easy to clean with soap and water.</p>
<p>CON: Over time, it may sag. It will not break down in a landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $3 per square foot.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">How to personalize your outdoor deck</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve narrowed down your choice of material, you can think about ways to customize the deck. “With all the styles and colors available, homeowners are really only limited by their imagination,” says Mucher.</p>
<h4>Outdoor deck design ideas:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mix different colors or shades of planks</li>
<li>Combine different plank widths</li>
<li>Run planks in different directions to create a pattern, like a herringbone or a fan</li>
<li>Add a contrasting border</li>
<li>Paint on a stenciled motif</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/chiminea1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30738 mb-10 size-chrono" title="outdoor deck" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/chiminea1-723x736.jpg" alt="deck cost" width="723" height="736" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><span class="img-label"> <span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Deck by CertainTeed</span></span></p>
<h4>Make the deck resemble an actual room:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create steps and two or more levels for different activities, such as relaxing, dining, taking in the view</li>
<li>Install an outdoor kitchen, chiminea (freestanding, front-loading fireplace or oven), or spa</li>
<li>Incorporate a pergola or a lanai</li>
<li>Include lighting, for use at night or to highlight an area</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, most decks, particularly those that are raised or tiered, include a railing. You can match your deck material or choose a complementary style or finish. Work with your contractor to make sure all the necessary elements are incorporated, for safety and security as well as environment and maintenance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Invest time in planning and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selecting a vetted general contractor</a> to guide you through the process. You want your deck to be dependable and a space you enjoy sharing with family and guests.</p>
