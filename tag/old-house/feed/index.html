</ul>
<h3>A home with potential</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s incredible what you can do to a house without knocking down a wall. We had to look beyond a lot of challenges, 40-year-old decor, </span><span class="s1">an antiquated electrical system, and thin, stained wooden floors. But we saw something we could work with.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42954 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait.jpg" alt="renovators on couch with dogs" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43007 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior.jpg" alt="exterior 1920s house remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house had a great layout. We loved the open first floor, with its nine-and-a-half-foot ceilings and perfect flow—the foyer, living room, and dining room were all open but the spaces were distinct. The second floor lacked overhead lighting and had wood paneling in every room, but was accessed by a beautiful staircase. Potential! We knew we could make it modern while preserving its ‘20s spirit.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42944 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors.jpg" alt="Black double French doors, living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42945 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway.jpg" alt="remodeled foyer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Hidden architectural designs</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not that it would be easy. The family we bought the house from had owned it for 34 years and it had a very retro feel. We hoped that the layers of carpet and wallpaper might conceal architectural delights, but were disappointed that the few special details we uncovered, like parquet inlays, were beyond salvaging.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We knew that foundational work would eat most of the budget, with the floors and walls requiring considerable attention.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The initial scope that we listed out for Sweeten offered a basic overview of our project, listing last: “</span><span class="s3">Inspect/clean electrical panel.” We mentioned the possible need to replace or expand it, but didn’t realize how much work it would actually require. Finding out that we needed to replace all of the wiring</span><span class="s1"> was one surprise that our renovation served up. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We scheduled walk-thoughs to see the work at various stages, including&#8230;the electrical portion. Seeing exactly what had been done before the walls were closed up was informative and reassuring.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42951 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3.jpg" alt="living room renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Combining the old with new</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We didn’t move or remove a single wall but we did add French doors in the foyer to create a barrier to summer heat and winter cold. Because most of the first floor is open concept, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interior doors help to keep</a> the temperature even and comfortable year-round, while also creating a dramatic entry into our living space. [See more <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/home/photo-gallery/45749027/image/45749041/Modern-Meets-Country">inspiring living rooms here</a>.]</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">One of our goals was to build in details that appeared original. Where we could, we blended the old with the new that included a molding update. We complemented the existing molding on the stairs with new molding on the adjacent wall. </span><span class="s1">Our contractor matched the living room ceiling to the dining room’s original trim and a ceiling medallion was installed, a hint at deco design. It was in this room that the house finally gave us a gift. Our contractor unearthed a window hidden inside the dining room exterior wall—a lovely find that, with some attention, brought us a lot more light.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42943 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg" alt="dining room remodeled" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Choosing the materials</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We stripped, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skim coated</a>, and painted the walls and redid two bathrooms investing in materials that would last. New floors were installed, windows were repaired, and energy-efficient ductless AC went throughout the house. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house felt instantly spacious and bright. The two things we were looking for in every choice we made: quality and classic style. From flooring and tiles to paint and different types of fixtures, we chose finishes we knew would last and look good for decades. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our color scheme, like everything else, is stark, graphic, and, most importantly, bright. White with the occasional swath of black feels timeless and pulls together everything from the foyer to the upstairs bath. A discreet beach vibe is there for those who look—low-key seashell references are hidden in a few small spots, a nod to the fact that we&#8217;re a 25-minute walk from Marine Park.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42955 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1.jpg" alt="Staircase remodel" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting things done to code</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We wound up doing nearly twice as much work and extending our schedule to four times the original plan. We spent a little over $120,000, including materials, a four-month apartment rental, and contractor costs. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">We were scrupulous about everything being done to code. Our Sweeten contractor had great communication skills and sent updates, photos, and videos via WhatsApp. We scheduled walk-throughs to see the work at various stages, including the point when the electrical portion was complete. Seeing exactly what had been done before the walls were closed up was informative and reassuring. As a civil engineer, Luke was heavily focused on ensuring that the electrical, plumbing, and structural elements were sound.</span></p>

<h3>An extensive renovation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This renovation taught us a lot! It wasn’t our first experience, but our biggest by far. We used many subcontractors, including electricians, HVAC specialists, plumbers, hardwood flooring installers, and plaster experts, and asked a lot of questions about the best processes, the ideal order for tasks, and how to complete them on a reasonable schedule. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The best part of the renovation? Seeing the “after” months later, after being so overwhelmed by the “before”! We didn’t gut the house, but we came close. The difference is dramatic. We are absolutely thrilled.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s2">You don’t have to take off those rose-colored glasses, but there’s much you need to know if you’re about to embark on a major reno. </span><span class="s2">Sometimes it means taking everything down to the studs or a home’s skeleton. And what is unseen—electrical wiring, plumbing pipes, heating and cooling ducts as well as insulation—are key to making sure everything runs efficiently and safely. Because there are so many unknowns when you open up walls, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-plan-your-renovation-and-find-the-best-general-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">don’t even think about DIY. Hire professionals. </a></span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>Is your house or neighborhood historic?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">If the house is 50 years old or more, and there are enough strong original architectural features, you may want to preserve them and/or replace elements like crown moldings when you can closely replicate the design. A general contractor can guide you on replacing, salvaging, or repairing these details. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Houses that have historic landmark status (national, state, or local) also benefit from some tax breaks. But that historic designation may limit changes you can make—especially on the exterior. If there are double-hung windows on the original façade, for example, you can’t replace them with picture windows. Even paint colors and hardware may be restricted. If you’re remodeling in a historic district, architectural style is in play. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Chicago, landmark homes and districts are governed by an ordinance with rules and regulations detailing what can and cannot be done. Repairing existing window sashes and frames, for example, is preferred to replacing. But if windows need to be replaced, they must match in style, material, glass size, muntins (dividers), profile, and trims. </span><span class="s1">Aluminum, vinyl, or other siding materials would not be suitable to substitute for wood clapboard. In brick construction, replacement with materials as close as possible to the original is advocated.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s2">Types of home additions</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">The footprint and square footage of the existing old house—and how much lot space you have around it, in the back, or to one side—determine how much you can add on. There are formulas in local zoning laws that calculate buildable space, with setbacks—how close to the front of the lot and neighboring property lines the building can be placed. Here are your options. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s4"><b>Add space by building out</b></span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Expand a kitchen and create a family room and/or breakfast room<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Adding a sunroom or screened porch are popular options for the first story<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Note: For ground floor additions, you’ll need a new foundation and footings.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s4"><b>Build up or down</b></span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">If you don’t have enough space to build out, you can build upon or create a new second story, or convert at the basement level. Check what your local zoning allows, based on total square footage of the property, and an equation that allows for the structure.  </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">For a master suite or more bedrooms and baths, you might build up by expanding an existing attic or adding a story or two.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Blowing out the roof and adding structural supports such as trusses also requires replacing the roof.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s6">A basement offers even more livable space. If the ceiling is below eight feet, consider</span><span class="s2"> underpinning, digging out and pouring new foundation and footings. Don&#8217;t forget the basement also needs to be kept free of moisture.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While converting two-flats to single-family dwellings may be less expensive than building new, plumbing pipes and wiring may need to be rerouted (eliminating one kitchen for example, or relocating baths). In addition, interior staircases may need to be relocated with structural reinforcement needed when loadbearing walls are removed.</span></p>
<h3>Improve the floor plan</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Older homes often have floor plans that just don’t work for today, with too small or chopped-up rooms. Sometimes it’s simply a matter of reconfiguring existing space.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Today, kitchens can spill into family/entertaining rooms, and include eat-in spaces at large islands or breakfast rooms. Powder room additions also serve this multifunctional space making it easily accessible for family and guests instead of climbing to another floor. </span>Old houses like townhouse or Tudors often didn&#8217;t have first-floor bathrooms. Other modern amenities include having a washer and dryer closer to the bedrooms upstairs or converting the basement into a guest suite.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">If load-bearing walls are removed, existing water, gas pipes, ductwork, and electrical wiring may need to be rerouted. Some kind of bracing, like ceiling beams and/or vertical supports, will be required.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>Updating house mechanicals</b></span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>Electrical</b>—One 100 amp circuit box may not be enough—especially if there are only a few slots left to upgrade electricity to accommodate heavier duty appliances, more lights, and a new HVAC, which add to the load of amps and circuits. A homeowner&#8217;s call to a professional electrician for an audit or inspection will help determine what needs to be upgraded (like adding GCFIs). They can reach out to the city for a sign-off. At least one 200 amp capacity electrical panel will probably be necessary. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s2">The <a href="https://www.phila.gov/media/20190521124726/Philadelphia_Rowhouse_Manual.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philadelphia Rowhouse Manual</a> states that if a circuit or fuse box trips frequently, consult an electrician and PECO to find the source of the overload and upgrade your service instead of replacing the breaker or fuse with one that carries greater capacity.<br />
</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>Plumbing</b>—The addition of bathrooms, tubs, showers, and even extra sinks may not only require the relocation of pipes, but it may call attention to existing water pressure in the home. Amping up the supply line from the main sewer to your home isn’t inexpensive, but it will assure a good flow of water throughout the home.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In older homes, it’s also a good idea to make sure there is no lead in the pipes, valves, or faucets. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The age of the existing hot water heater determines whether or not it needs to be replaced. Consider high-efficiency tankless heaters: they take up less space and are more efficient, as they supply hot water on demand.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>HVAC</b>—Depending on the age of the heating and cooling systems, you may want to replace units for more efficiency.  Sizing is calculated according to square footage; sometimes two or more furnaces and air conditioners are needed. Make sure ducts are insulated. Zoning spaces also is a good idea, so that you can shut down areas of the house that may not be used all the time.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s2">Boosting energy efficiency</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Many old homes are <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not at all well insulated</a>, which can create drafty situations as well as severely impact heat loss. Take into consideration the age of the roof and be sure this space is in good shape. </span><span class="s2">There are several <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/insulation/home-energy-efficiency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ways to add insulation</a> to an attic or to walls. Insulation is based on  R-values (thermal resistance). Naturally, the higher the R-value, the better (the highest number is 45, rated on vacuum-insulated panels). For NYC historic rowhouses, an energy auditor can test for a home&#8217;s energy efficiency. The Municipal Art Society of New York <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/lpc/downloads/pdf/pubs/Manual%20-%20Greening%20Rowhouses%20-%202012.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advises to first consider</a> less invasive wall or roof repairs before adding insulation or other extensive work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Types of insulation</b> </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Fiberglass is predominantly found in most homes. It comes as batt and rolls or loose-fill and is fire retardant.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Cellulose insulation is an older type of insulation typically blown-in packing into wall cavities and conforms to the structure it’s insulating.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Injection foam is a shoot-in insulation and the most expensive. It’s fire-rated and doesn’t retain water.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Replace windows</b></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Consider replacing windows with Energy Star-qualified ones. All wood, vinyl, aluminum clad with wood inside, and fiberglass are some options. Important features to look for: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Low-E, or Low-Emissivity, with metallic coatings that allow windows to reflect rather than absorb heat<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Double or triple panes<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Gas-filled (argon or krypton gas) between glazed layers to improve heat insulation and slow heat transfer<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s2">Preserving wood flooring</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Sometimes underneath the wall-to-wall carpeting, you’ll luck out and find original hardwood. Tack holes can be sanded out and the floors refinished. Yellowing, which often occurs with natural polyurethane finishes due to sunlight exposure or water damage, is easy to fix with sanding and refinishing. If the boards are too blackened and you’re not using a dark stain, they need to be replaced, as do warped boards.  </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">While the whole process may be challenging, fixing any issues and fortifying the inner workings of the house will help abate surprises down the road. And then you can look around you—everything is just as you imagined! You’re soooo happy. Toast your efforts. You deserve it.</span></p>
