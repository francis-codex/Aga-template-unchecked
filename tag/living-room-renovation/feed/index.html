			<h2>Sweeten homeowners make work-from-home spaces permanent fixtures</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56474 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/116726-Sally-Morgridge-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="office kitchen with floral wallpaper" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/116726-Sally-Morgridge-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/116726-Sally-Morgridge-Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/116726-Sally-Morgridge-Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sally and Aaron&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/office-kitchen-becomes-a-family-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home office remodel</a></p>
<p>Homeowners have been earnest in creating home offices for keeps. No longer just a temporary notion, working from home requires a dependable go-to space to fit an organizational system.</p>
<p>Whether you have a whole room or a nook to use, creating a functional space is possible. Below, Sweeten homeowners transform closets, basements, and small sections in kitchens into productive workspaces.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Kitchen office space</h3>
<p class="p1">As the hub of the home, a home office in the kitchen makes it available to the whole family. Even the most compact desk with a drawer is useful to sit and jot a note or look through a recipe.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg" alt="open kitchen with home office and dining space" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40958" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Out of the whole apartment remodel, Chris’ favorite part was the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/family-homecoming-hudson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in home office desk</a>. Erin and Chris’ design-build firm created an organized drawer and cabinet system matching the finishes of the kitchen. It was just right as a creative space. An organized system handled the constant flow of homework, art supplies, and collections.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-workspace-open-shelves" class="alignnone wp-image-44768 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Randy-Office.jpg" alt="white workspace with open shelves and white cabinets and golden framed chair after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Randy-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Randy-Office-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Randy-Office-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A separate office wasn’t in the cards for Laura and Randy, but they </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found a solution: a kitchen desk niche</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s right off the main kitchen area and matches the rest of the white cabinetry. Bold, patterned wallpaper gives the desk a sense of separation from the rest of the kitchen, too.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/116726-Sally-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="Home office kitchen with Gray cabinets with matte black hardware" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56741" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/116726-Sally-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/116726-Sally-Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/116726-Sally-Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With both Sally and Aaron working from home, a proper <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/office-kitchen-becomes-a-family-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen office space</a> would have a major impact on their daily lives. The layout they planned gave the galley a continuous flow and a large desk for their kids to use while the parents cooked. In addition, built-in cabinets surround the desk above and along the sides doubling the storage. Pull-out pantry-style doors hold stationery and desk supplies. Sally and Aaron spent $45,000–$50,000 on their new kitchen renovation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="patterned-floor-blue-wallpaper" class="alignnone wp-image-44769 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mollie-Office.jpg" alt="black and white patterned flooring and blue cabinets and a white desk space and blue wall paper and open white shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mollie-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mollie-Office-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mollie-Office-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With climbing prices in her Fort Greene co-op building, Mollie faced a problem. She could cash out (but deal with moving) or stay where she was. The neighborhood was ideal, but the look of her outdated 500-square-foot studio apartment was not. She decided to remain and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned to a Sweeten contractor</a> to help update her kitchen. Along with bright blue cabinets and dishwasher drawers, the contractor found space for a desk nook. As a result, Mollie chose bold wallpaper to set it apart as an &#8220;office.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="patterned-floor-kitchen-study" class="alignnone wp-image-44770 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Barbra-Office.jpg" alt="patterned black and white floor in a white kitchen and small study with white desk and white closed cabinets after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Barbra-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Barbra-Office-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Barbra-Office-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Barbra and Sean waited almost 10 years before renovating their 1,100-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home in Kensington, Brooklyn</a>. They knew exactly what they needed to make their space work better for their family. Their kitchen had an existing spot for a desk so it seemed <span style="font-weight: 400;">natural to carve out a similar area in their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully remodeled kitchen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as well. The renovators found a desk that fit right into the opening. They also used leftover wallpaper from their foyer to give it a finished look.</span></p>
<h3>A home office remodel transforms spare bedrooms</h3>
<p>If you have a spare bedroom, you can turn it—or just a part of it—into a beautiful workspace like the homeowners below. Bedrooms usually have good lighting, natural or overhead lights.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="wooden-table-brown-chest-of-drawers" class="alignnone wp-image-44765 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jenifer-Office.jpg" alt="wooden table and a brown chest of drawers in an office space with large window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jenifer-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jenifer-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jenifer-Office-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenifer Herrmann, a media executive, and her partner, Mitzie Wong, co-founder of creative design firm </span><a href="https://roarandrabbit.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roar + Rabbit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, found a two-bed, two-bath apartment for sale at a price that left them with a renovation budget. In addition to a kitchen and two bathroom renovations, creating a home office space for Mitzie was a priority for their remodel. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned the second bedroom into a home office</a>. It was the perfect space for Mitzie to separate work from personal life. She decorated it with her art materials, books, and growing plant collection. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="black-highlight-wall-office-space" class="alignnone wp-image-44766 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eric-Office.jpg" alt="black highlight wall in an office space with white desk and black chair and natural wooden floor after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eric-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eric-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eric-Office-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a work-from-home space was essential for first-time renovators Maria and Eric. They planned to include a home office in their 850-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment in Woodside, Queens. The couple worked with their Sweeten contractor <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/scandinavian-kitchen-renovation-crown-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to convert the second bedroom into a small office.</a> They designed it to keep with the Scandinavian-chic aesthetic featured in the other rooms in their home. </span></p>
<h3>Consider a home office remodel in unexpected places</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a saying: &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing that can&#8217;t be done.&#8221; That is just what these Sweeten renovators believed when trying to incorporate a home office into their living spaces. With out-of-the-box thinking, they envisioned spaces that would make working from home more comfortable. We love seeing how they squeezed their desks into creative places!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-16.jpg" alt="home office remodel from a bedroom closet" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44563" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Sweeten homeowner Beth required a fully functional <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-check-all-the-boxes-apartment-for-empty-nesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home office</a> in a dedicated space. In a clever swap, the master bedroom’s large double-door closet was flipped to be used in the second bedroom next door as a home office.</p>
<p>Discuss with your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a> if a work-from-home space is possible with your home layout.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="light-wooden-floor-white-bedroom" class="alignnone wp-image-44772 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cody-Office.jpg" alt="light wooden floor in a white bedroom with tiny study nook with white cabinets after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cody-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cody-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cody-Office-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>This beautiful corner apartment in Hudson Heights, Manhattan was a perfect spot for Marisa and Cody&#8217;s growing family. They turned to Sweeten to help renovate the space, with the goal of joining the kitchen and living area. They wanted the apartment to &#8220;feel open <span style="font-weight: 400;">and modern, but warm and homey at the same time.&#8221; They were able to fit into the design a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/open-kitchen-design-architect/">desk nook in the corner of one room</a>, utilizing the ceiling height by installing storage cabinets above the desktop. </span></p>
<div></div>
<p>What do you do with that little bit of extra room on your stairway landing? If you are creative like Dianna, an advertising agency director, and Todd, a college professor, you create a small office. The couple lives in a 440-square-foot studio alcove apartment, so space efficiency is critical. The office space is made possible by using a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/small-space-renovation-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corner table that fits perfectly on the landing</a> and floating shelves for storage and aesthetic interest.</p>
<h3>Multipurpose rooms combine work and play</h3>
<p>Sometimes you just can&#8217;t justify allocating a whole room to an office. Instead, you have to rethink the traditional concept of a home office and utilize what you have. One way to do this: turn parts of other rooms into your work area. Here, a look at Sweeten renovators who worked with that they had to make efficient, convenient work areas.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Millennial sisters Deanna and Daria found a one-bedroom in Manhattan that they could <span style="font-weight: 400;">convert into two. They worked with a contractor from Sweeten&#8217;s network to <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/millennial-sisters-buy-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revamp the awkwardly laid out floor plan</a> into a charming home. They reduced the size of the master bedroom to make way for a shared 7’ x 10’ closet workstation. The walk-in fit a home office decked out with a simple white desk, blue-fabric chair, and a desk lamp.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44777 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Toby-Office.jpg" alt="a multipurpose room provides work from home space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Toby-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Toby-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Toby-Office-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Since homeowner Toby had working knowledge of design and architecture, he was was very involved in his Manhattan co-op renovation. The living/dining area was open and spacious. Therefore, he set out to lay out a seamless space with multiple functions. He split the room into a dining area, office space, and sitting lounge (not pictured). A truly multi-purpose room!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="green-sofa-pink-pouffe" class="alignnone wp-image-44778 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gordon-Office_DixonProj-NotOurPhotography.jpg" alt="green sofa and pink poufee and cushions in an office space with white open shelves and white desk after renovation" width="1000" height="692" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gordon-Office_DixonProj-NotOurPhotography.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gordon-Office_DixonProj-NotOurPhotography-300x208.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gordon-Office_DixonProj-NotOurPhotography-600x415.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Gordon and Tracy looked to Sweeten to help them find a general contractor who they could trust to turn their townhouse in the Sunnyside Historic Garden District into a more family-friendly space. They knew they needed to use all three floors so, with the help of their contractor, they <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-basement-remodel-boosts-a-petite-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transformed the basement</a> into a dual living and utility/storage space, complete with an office area. The floating desk and shelves enlarge the room, leaving space for an entertainment area, laundry room, and second bathroom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years after Claudia purchased her one-bedroom, one-bath apartment in a quaint Upper East Side co-op, she felt ready to renovate. Since arriving in 2001, this software engineer knew that she’d eventually need to address the 30 year-old carpeting, fixtures, and odd space issues&#8230;or simply move on and find a new home. Loving everything about the building, the neighborhood, and her lifestyle, she decided to stay put and find a designer who could bring an architectural approach and a restorative eye to this lovely space. Read on for the stunning reveal of Claudia’s thoughtful and personal apartment renovation!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18472 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg" alt="apartment renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-18306"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia first readied herself with a straightforward list of tasks she wanted to accomplish. Sure, the place hadn’t been updated anywhere in three decades, so finishes throughout were more than dated. But she also craved more space, and after seeing neighboring units without the built-ins and boxy windows that had been added in a mid-80s renovation, she realized she might be able to reclaim some hidden square footage (and long-missing electrical outlets) in her own unit. The kitchen and bathroom needed a complete treatment, and the living room and bedroom required diametrically opposed designs: out with chunky built-ins on multiple walls in the living room, and in with a thoughtful and multi-functional built-in for the windowed bedroom wall.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishlist near complete, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claudia decided to post her project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2531" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was matched with a Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who specializes in creating architecture and interior design solutions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon meeting with Frederick and his team, Claudia made an overarching goal clear: She wasn’t interested in solely installing modern finishes over the old. The original bones were just as important as the final coat of paint. That pristine 1929 appeal needed to show through and reveal itself via new design details. With extensive renovations planned in every room, Claudia moved out of the apartment temporarily to allow for Frederick and his crew to get started. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia believed that original parquet floors were hiding underneath all the carpeting, and she was right. Frederick had the wood floors sanded and refinished, bringing them back to life without introducing any new materials. With extra sheetrock walls encroaching in multiple directions, the team chipped away at the wall of boxed windows, disposing of an 18 inch layer of brick and wood. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avert your eyes if you live in a typical NYC co-op, because you will probably NEVER experience this, but somehow Claudia nearly doubled the size of her living room windows by combining them, flooding the space with lovely natural light. All of the windows were replaced with double-paned versions, up to code with the building and boasting the required heat, freeze and UV protections. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the opposite end of the room, the crew stripped away the ever-so-slightly-asymmetrical built-in shelving and cabinetry to reveal an open, wood-burning hearth. Claudia turned to a local Italian couple who specialize in old world mantels for an understated limestone facade, and Frederick brought in a specialist to design and install crown moldings along the doorways, windows, ceiling and floor boards throughout the apartment. Claudia’s mother helped source the final touch: an accent wall in a serene, neutral palette is an elegant and stylish addition to an inviting new living room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the kitchen, Claudia knew she wanted a white kitchen and was unsentimental about getting rid of the “horrible” gray linoleum floors. Cosmetic features aside, she wanted more storage space and a way to install an exhaust fan over a new cooktop. In an attempt to carve out some casual eating space, the previous owners had put some very limited cabinetry along the left-side of the galley, and appliances took up most of the storage and prep space on the right side.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claudia chose a small pearlescent stone tile in a melange of pebble hues to take the place of the severely dated synthetic floor she’d grown to detest. High-impact cabinet changes were custom fit into the small space. Claudia worked with an Italian purveyor specializing in hidden compartments for the fridge and hood, and managed to conceal all of the major stainless steel appliances except for the striking new Bertazzoni range, because, Bertazzoni! The laminate countertops were removed and replaced with a white Caesarstone slab and corresponding backsplash, and an undermount stainless sink&#8211;supplied by the same producer as the cabinets&#8211;was installed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia knew she didn’t need to change the footprint of her bathroom to incorporate the many features she wanted here. The tub needed two shower curtains to keep water in, the full surround of blue-gray tile muted natural light, and the bulky vanity was topped with a throwback plastic ball faucet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia went with a floor tile pick that is complementary but different to those used in the kitchen, and with Frederick’s help, incorporated extra pieces into a design detail border along the wall of freshly installed white subway tiles. The tub came out and was replaced with a slightly larger and more modern German piece to coincide with new spa accessories: a rainwater shower head plus a handheld option for added luxe. The fixed shower rod was taken down to make way for a glass partition and hinged glass door that swings out for maximum function and style. Claudia chose a pedestal sink for extra floor and knee space, opting to place storage behind hidden cabinets in the wall instead. Almost all of the bathroom features were handpicked from local design shop Elegance in Hardware, including the polished nickel door knobs, which are exclusive to the outlet.  </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bedroom, Claudia and her design-build team pursued the opposite approach. Instead of doing away with built-ins, they found areas where custom additions would have a meaningful impact on space use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They added a custom closet in the hallway, outfitted  by California Closets, just outside the bath before entering the living room and introduced this same custom storage concept in the bedroom, behind a mirrored closet wall—one of the only major features that remained. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the carpet was torn out in the bedroom, Claudia approached Frederick with her hopes of incorporating a window seat before new wall treatment and molding went in. The designer re-enlisted his subcontractor to fashion a custom wooden seat built right into the new shelving set. The homeowner would just need an upholstered cushion and good book to make it complete.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18464 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-21.jpg" alt="bedroom renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-21.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-21-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18465" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="window seat" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-22.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-22-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia revealed to us that upon visiting her apartment, after the renovations were complete and the dust had nearly cleared, she stood and looked around the empty rooms and was filled with the sense that nothing had changed. It was as if she were apartment shopping in 1929, which, she explained, is exactly what she wanted.</span></p>

<em>Guest post by Chris, Ditmas Park homeowner<br />
</em><br />
For six of the seven years that we have owned our one-bedroom co-op apartment in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, our dream was to renovate it. A year ago, we did just that, but the path there was far from a straight line. When we actually looked into what a renovation would mean in terms of time, cost, and effort, with all the headaches that co-ops can entail, we realized that just buying another apartment would be infinitely easier. (Having our two-year-old in the bedroom with us definitely added the kind of urgency that any parent can probably relate to). When we started to look for two-bedroom apartments that actually felt like upgrades in terms of space and location, we found virtually nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So it had to be a renovation. But how? We started to tackle the issues one by one. We figured out the financing, looked into sublets, and tenuously read through the pages and pages of legal documents our co-op’s management company required before any work could happen. When it came to finding an architect to work with us, we hit a brick wall. Our job was too small for the architects we had seen featured on our favorite design blogs, but too big to just leave to a contractor to wing it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That was when we discovered <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our renovation project</a> to their site, and they led us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these Sweeten general contractors</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We needed to convert our eat-in kitchen into a bedroom for our son and open up the rest of the kitchen into the living room, but we had no idea how. Our contractor duo won us over with their easygoing demeanors and their innovative design for our space, which involved sealing off the existing entry to the galley kitchen and completely opening it up to the living room. It meant one less doorway in our foyer which already felt like a cross between Grand Central and a stroller parking lot, and one big living/eating/cooking space that would feel open and airy, the opposite of the rabbit warren we feared the apartment would become by carving another bedroom out of it. Then we found out that Amber was pregnant again, and things got real, real fast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17193 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17180 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-09.jpg" alt="half galley kitchen in ditmas park" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-09.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-09-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractors brought a team to the table who were very competitively priced for work with a high degree of detail and things suddenly started to fall into place: financing, co-op, and management company approval, permits. Our contractors served as our construction managers as well as our architects which enabled them to oversee all aspects of construction and deal with most issues long before we ever were aware. They had regular meetings with us to make sure we knew exactly where we were in the process. It meant we could deal with the fun stuff &#8212; configuring our cabinets and open shelves, choosing the right quartz countertops and lighting, and spending less time worrying about the day to day construction details and timeline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We went into this project with the intention of buying ourselves a few more years in the apartment, since ultimately we want to move to a house outside the city. Knowing we would sell in a few years, we bought appliances that have outstanding value but aren’t necessarily top of the top. The NXR range is fantastic for the money, plenty good for the cooking we do at home, and great looking. Our fridge is a Summit since we needed a true counter-depth fridge (just wait until you realize how many manufacturers call their products counter-depth when they are anything but), and our Bosch dishwasher is everything we could want, considering it is the first dishwasher my wife and I have ever had.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A year later, we have the kind of bright open space that we dreamed of and a kitchen that makes cooking fun. Our son Finn is growing so fast that soon our days in the apartment may start to feel numbered, but then again we can always call our contracting duo to see if they can work another miracle.</p>
