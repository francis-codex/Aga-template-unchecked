<h3>Making a vision reality</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before buying, Casey and Kumar, who are both designers at <a href="https://www.studiomilleratre.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studio Miller Atre</a>, thought whether they could find a home that would allow their family to stay in New York. Moving out of the city for more space seemed like the only option. Then they discovered a one-bedroom in Clinton Hill with a wall of south-facing windows.</p>

			<h3>Planning a multipurpose room</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make a one-bedroom work for their four-person family, Casey and Kumar closely examined routines and patterns in their daily lives. Their sons, Luc and River, needed quiet when they went off to bed early each night. Their toys and play area tended to colonize space so it made sense for the master bedroom to become the nursery.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="sliding-partition-door-and-hardwood-floors" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54544 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-20.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-20-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-54546 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-29.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Casey and Kumar also focused on optimizing the living space. It needed to feel as open as possible, preserve natural light, and allow typically distinct spaces to share square footage and core functions. The designers posted their project on Sweeten. They were introduced to a Sweeten general contractor who helped bring the couple’s collaborative drawings to life.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54540 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-16.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="648" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-16-300x194.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-16-600x389.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-54547 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-30.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>The biggest challenge, having assigned the only bedroom to their children, was locating their own. They designed a multipurpose room of custom millwork containing a pull-down bed. A surround of retracting walls allowed them to swap sleep space for play and work space as well as an entertaining area.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54538 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-14.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="660" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-14-300x198.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-14-600x396.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-54539 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-15.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="661" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-15-300x198.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-15-600x397.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Integrating the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The designers envisioned an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrated kitchen</a> as a central part of the main shared space. The prep and cooking utility would transition without making visual disruptions into the dining and living area. They decided to forgo upper cabinets to keep sightlines clear across the space. The millwork, in a striking combination of natural wood and stone materials, dressed up to resemble a piece of furniture. Soapstone countertops and backsplash and slate floor tiles added functionality and a dark tone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54527 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-04.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54534 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-10.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>The ultimate kitchen pantry</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The understated wall of square doors next to it opened an intricate array of pull-out compartments dedicated to specific uses. Before drawing the kitchen cabinets, Casey and Kumar documented the exact storage requirements they needed to accommodate, to guarantee a precise fit. Finally, they situated the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/how-panel-ready-refrigerators-change-a-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panel ready refrigerator</a>, freezer, and pantry just across from the kitchen, as a single integrated design. It also conceals the apartment’s only structural column.</p>
<p>All of this works together to allow the kitchen to be a social space. Or on display as a backdrop to the life of the dining and sitting areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54528 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54536 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-12.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="656" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-12-300x197.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-12-600x394.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54537 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-13.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="658" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-13-300x197.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-13-600x395.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-54535 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-11.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="791" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-11-300x237.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-11-600x475.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A classic and comfortable bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Casey and Kumar aimed for a general upgrade. It would complement the building’s modernist design origins. They chose classic fixtures with simple shapes and Inca black stone mosaic floor tile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54523 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1431" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-01-210x300.jpg 210w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-01-600x859.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1475" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-54526" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-03-203x300.jpg 203w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-03-600x885.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-54524 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Modern and historical outcome</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Across the board, Casey and Kumar wanted to avoid glossing over the history and character of their building with a layer of ‘newness&#8217;. They kept the finishes in line with what was there before. By picking up on material cues from their favorite furnishings, the family was able to infuse many technical design decisions with uncharacteristic and inspiring warmth!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">John lived in his two-bedroom Hell’s Kitchen co-op apartment for practically a decade before addressing a number of areas in the home that had been neglected over time. Stately pre-war molding from the early 1920s was buried under years of paint, ancient water damage permeated some walls, electrical outlets were sparse&#8211;even door knobs were finicky. Ready to make significant changes to the kitchen, bedrooms, and book storage space just in time for Katharine to move in, the couple—both behind-the-scenes professionals in the entertainment industry—needed a crew to help transform their home into a modern day co-op with old-world charm. Read on for John’s take on their thoroughly ambitious home renovation!</span></i></p>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by John, Hell’s Kitchen homeowner </span></i><span id="more-18013"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the apartment was largely in its original, 1923 state. We loved a lot of the classic details but many of them had begun to decay and the plaster walls were in various states of disrepair. It was increasingly difficult to keep clean. So, the primary goal was to restore the walls and floors to good working order, replace the trim and molding that was falling apart, and generally remove a lot of the cluttered and clashing elements that had built up over the years. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen had been redone at least once, probably in the late 90s, but the life of that renovation was ending and the cabinets were breaking and falling apart. We wanted to find a way to make the small kitchen/living room space work. We weren’t making substantial structural changes and wouldn&#8217;t be moving plumbing or gas, but the whole space definitely needed a general cosmetic and electrical make-over. So, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1939" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we posted our project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to find a design and construction team to take on the work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The living room, especially, was a challenge. It had a reasonably sized kitchen, which is great because I cook a lot, but finding a way to balance the space between kitchen and living room without shortchanging either was really the central problem we tackled. It had previously been semi-divided by a wall and an island which left the corner around the couch dark and cramped, and still didn&#8217;t allow for a full-sized fridge. We removed the wall and created a central island that could function as both a work space and a dining table. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I splurged on a dual-fuel Wolf range, which was right up against the realm of possibility given the amount of available power to the apartment, but which I&#8217;m pretty happy about (a gas stovetop is basically essential, as far as I&#8217;m concerned). The refrigerator is a 32&#8243; french door model, not quite &#8220;full sized&#8221;; I found the unit that offered the most storage volume but which could still physically fit, with the doors removed, into the small freight elevator in our building. We originally had a slightly larger model that did not fit. I toyed with recruiting friends to help me carry it up to the tenth floor. In retrospect, this probably would have been a mistake.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The microwave is also Wolf; they make a unit that opens like a drawer and can be loaded from the top, rather than the traditional swing door style. It&#8217;s a little silly but this allowed us to install it in the kitchen island facing away from the front door, rather than in the more normal spot above the stove. I don&#8217;t use the microwave a ton and it seemed silly to give it that front and center pride of place; better to have the nice custom cabinet-fronts there.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We got fairly traditional knobs and miscellaneous hardware; we used unlacquered brass for the &#8220;living room&#8221; side of the main room and nickel for the &#8220;kitchen&#8221; side as a way to differentiate the shared space. We love the brass; the original knobs and apartment hardware are all nearly 100-year-old brass, and we specifically sought out the unlacquered pieces, which seem a little less common, because our hope is that over the years they will patina and start to take on some of the character of the old ones. Most of our miscellaneous hardware pieces are from Simon&#8217;s Hardware and Bath, and we&#8217;ve been pretty happy with them. We got slightly funky drawer pulls from Urban Archaeology, which were pricey, but which we really love. The pendant lights are from O&#8217;Lampia, a shop on the Bowery; the guy there makes custom pieces that we both really like, and we would enthusiastically recommend him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen faucet is Rohl, less expensive than the ubiquitous Waterworks (which is what I used for the bathroom renovation in 2008) and supposedly, at least according to our plumber, more reliable. Lever handles are key for me for a kitchen faucet, since it&#8217;s difficult to turn on cross handles with your elbows when your hands are covered in raw chicken. Having the spout elevated as high above the sink as possible is also pretty important to me, it allows more space to work when washing dishes (no dishwashers allowed in my building!).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would count our (very consciously UN-oiled) blue/green soapstone on the kitchen island among our riskier&#8211;but ultimately most rewarding&#8211;design choices. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the apartment, we wanted to maintain as much of the pre-war character as possible, while also lightening and opening up the space. There was picture frame molding partway up the walls, which we replaced with crown molding at the ceiling. The style is similar but it makes the ceilings feel higher and complements the many beams without calling too much attention to them. Most of the choices we made were along these lines, classic in style but slightly more understated than the original as befits a fairly small apartment. We refurbished and kept original elements where we could, like the heavy doors and metal door frames.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We built in a lot of shelves and cabinets in order to maximize space and we opened-up the awkwardly placed living room closet (originally blocked by the couch) to make a kind of library/office nook that also makes the space feel larger.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18038 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18045 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-18034 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-11.jpg" alt="office nook" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-11-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For non-decorative lighting in the smaller spaces, we went with simple schoolhouse ceiling fixtures that are pretty similar to what was originally installed, again with brass accents. To fill out the three rooms, we also added track lighting, which is perhaps a little unusual. They are fairly unobtrusive and allow a lot of coverage, flexibility, and directionality while staying as close to the ceiling as possible (we would have had to drop the ceiling to install in-ceiling lights). We accented with warm-tone, high CRI LED fixtures in places where they could be installed, like in cabinets, the hallways, and in the kitchen.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Last week <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/site-visit-billy-sallys-diy-project-begins-w-thesweeten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we introduced you</a> to a Brooklyn-based couple who have just completed the renovation of their 775 sqft Fort Greene flat: Billy, a freelance web developer (currently at <a href="https://www.paddle8.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paddle8</a>), and Sally, a <a href="https://www.sallypaul.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painter</a> and museum educator at MoMA, ICP and the American Museum of Folk Art. Billy &amp; Sally&#8217;s project got started on Sweeten with preliminary construction work by Sweeten member <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ecostruct llc</a>, and subsequently finished up with a full kitchen update and flooring replacement carried out by Billy &amp; Sally themselves (&#8211;some of which is also documented <a href="https://billyfowks.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> on Billy&#8217;s renovation blog). The couple, along with their kitty, Lil&#8217; Miss, recently invited us back to show off the gorgeous results. Their new space is cozy &amp; bright, and, after being put to the test over the holidays, is also a perfect venue for cooking &amp; entertaining!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6587 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/00_theSweeten_billyandsally02.png" alt="stylishly-curated-home-renovation-brooklyn" width="560" height="392" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/00_theSweeten_billyandsally02.png 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/00_theSweeten_billyandsally02-300x210.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />Here is what the apartment looked like just before Billy &amp; Sally moved in. Throughout the apartment the parquet floors were badly worn and the ceilings showed significant water damage. The kitchen, which was tucked away in a maze of walls, was a tight &amp; dreadfully generic space.</p>

Here in the entry we have our first glimpse of the new flooring and the open kitchen. <img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinet-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38588 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and black countertop and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Billy &amp; Sally selected a light and modern-looking floor surface of engineered hickory that could actually be installed on top of the existing parquet floors (more on the install <a href="https://billyfowks.com/blog/2012/09/05/flooring-install-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). So, leaving the old parquet surface intact, they removed only the small area of kitchen tiles and replaced them with a layer of sub-flooring before finally working their way through the entire apartment with <a href="https://www.lumberliquidators.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the new hickory boards</a>. <img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinet-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38589 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and black countertop and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />In the kitchen, ikea cabinets with <a href="https://www.berensonhardware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berenson pulls</a> look clean &amp; modern, and since they&#8217;re more budget-friendly than custom cabinets, the duo was able to splurge on well-designed appliances. We especially love their new Bertazzoni range (available online <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). Other new additions include a refrigerator by <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel</a> and a sleek dishwasher by <a href="https://www.blombergappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blomberg</a>. <img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinet-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38590 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with black countertop and undermount stainless steel sink and faucet after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Similar to the cabinets, the new kitchen <a href="https://www.ikea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sink</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faucet</a> are also from ikea. <img decoding="async" title="small-open-kitchen-and-dining" class="wp-image-38591 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-723x1044.jpg" alt="small open kitchen with floating shelves and peninsula island and dining space after renovation" width="723" height="1044" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-723x1044.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-208x300.jpg 208w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-600x867.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Above the new kitchen island, the couple chose a pair of all-white pendants which were purchased on ebay.  The open shelving in the far corner is made from ikea <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NUMERAR</a> countertops that were cut to fit and mounted on elfa brackets (available at <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/welcome.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Container Store</a>). These shelves remind us a lot of <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/site-visit-lucky-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the unit ecostruct built for Amanda</a> last summer. <img decoding="async" title="open-shelves-and-white-kitchen-cabinets" class="wp-image-38592 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets and open shelves and stainless steel appliances and black countertop after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />One of Billy &amp; Sally&#8217;s favorite new features &#8211;and another worthwhile splurge&#8211; are their lovingly-polished <a href="https://www.soapstones.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soapstone</a> countertops. <img decoding="async" title="peninsula-kitchen-island-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38593 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="peninsula kitche island with black countertop and pendant light and hardwood floors after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Looking back into the living area, it&#8217;s clear that cooking is now a social activity rather than a private one. <img decoding="async" title="floating-book-shelves-in-living-room" class="wp-image-38594 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="floating book shelves on white wall in living room with hardwood floors after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />More open shelving in the living space makes for lovely &amp; efficient storage, as well as a nice display alongside the couple&#8217;s unique art collection. Best of all, the repeated shelving details weave this space together with the kitchen.</p>
<p>BIG thanks to Billy &amp; Sally for sharing their beautiful renovation!</p>
