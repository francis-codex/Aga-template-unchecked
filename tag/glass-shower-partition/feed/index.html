<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Bringing a dilapidated <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16732" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bath</a> into the 21st century in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Last week, we saw how Natalie and Cartier transformed the <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/perfect-custom-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen and living room</a> of their one-bedroom apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops. Their bathroom was in a similar state of disrepair from a rust-stained bathtub and matching sink to the peeling, flowery wallpaper and lavender tiles that were not to the couple’s taste at all. With the help of their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a>, they implemented a set of bathroom renovation ideas that contrasted white tiles with dark grout for a look that’s thoroughly modern.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: As in the rest of the apartment, Natalie and Cartier created a clean, streamlined look by combining white tile, flat-front cabinetry in a dark wood finish, and chrome Grohe fixtures. The choice of a 4” x 12” subway tile for the walls gave the bath a more contemporary look than the traditional 3” x 6” subway tile. The couple chose a dark grout for contrast and paired it with charcoal <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooring</a> in porcelain tile. Sleek bar <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lighting</a> and recessed lights maintained the unfussy look. The space was a typical NYC bathroom, which meant that they had to maximize <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage space</a> without it feeling too cramped. Another one of their bathroom renovation ideas involved two niches built into the wall of the shower to provide a convenient area for storing bath products. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA sink and vanity</a> helped to keep the cost down while the pair splurged on a thermostatic <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/luxury-shower-systems-steaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower system</a> that includes a rain shower, a handheld showerhead, as well as a faucet. They decided on the thermostatic shower valves because of bad experiences in past apartments with drastic changes in shower temperature, and this technology addressed that problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Cartier hated the way that shower curtains got dingy over time (no matter how diligent you were about airing them out!). As a result, he was particularly excited about the glass partition between the tub and the sink which simplifies the task of cleaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Porcelain floor tile, PT 12&#8243; x 24&#8243; Basaltina Linosa (cut into squares): <a href="https://www.arizonatile.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona Tile</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When they began looking for more space, Chelsea residents Lauren and Ross didn’t want to move far from their Manhattan neighborhood. Luckily, they found a new home in Kensington House, an Art Deco co-op building just three blocks from their old place. The two-bed, two-bath apartment featured plentiful space for entertaining—a must for Lauren, a food industry professional, as well as the perfect nook for Ross’ piano. The baths in this Emory Roth-designed building were true to their 1930s roots, with out-of-style tiling, industrial flushometer toilets, and exposed radiator pipes that were an unattractive hazard. The couple tapped the interior design firm White Arrow to create hotel-inspired baths with more storage. Read also about their choice for color and a unique, space-saving pocket door solution.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22106 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Pocket Door" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-723x506.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08" width="723" height="506" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-723x506.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-300x210.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-600x420.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Guest post by Chelsea homeowner and food writer Lauren Shockey</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband, Ross, and I purchased a two-bedroom apartment in Chelsea last year. We were already living in a one-bedroom apartment in the same neighborhood and wanted to upgrade to an apartment that had more space. After about three months of looking, we found the perfect apartment, only three blocks from where we were living.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the loft-style layout of the apartment we found, but the bathrooms were in a bit of a sorry state. The tile was outdated and one of the baths had a huge old-school metal tub stopper located next to the toilet. So we planned on gutting the two spaces along with a few extra upgrades, such as replacing the kitchen’s backsplash and lighting, sanding the floors, repainting the apartment, removing a desk in the study to accommodate a piano, and turning a less-than-ideal barn door in the dining foyer into a more discreet pocket door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We hired <a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Arrow</a>, a friend’s sister’s design company to assist us with the design process, and they, in turn, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our contractor</a>. Our Sweeten contractor was also very helpful throughout the design process and suggested modifications and tweaks to the original design that best fit our needs.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">Creating a wide barn pocket door proved to be a challenge but &#8220;our contractor suggested we attach three store-bought doors together&#8230;&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We initially budgeted two to three months for the renovation process, and typical for New York, ended up taking about four months. The apartment’s previous tenants took all of their light fixtures with them when they moved out, so we purchased new light fixtures for all of the rooms. I created a Pinterest board to help refine my ideas. We especially love the distinctive CB2 chandelier which hangs above our dining room table.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being a food writer and having written <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Kitchens-Behind-Burner-Hanoi/dp/B00AK2TMOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four Kitchens</a></em>, a book about working in restaurants around the world, it was important for me to have a clean, streamlined kitchen for cooking and entertaining. We loved the custom cabinets that were already in place but wanted to update the backsplash by installing white subway tiles to replace the existing small red-and-brown multicolored ones. We also swapped out the sink faucet for a contemporary Grohe fixture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ross loves playing piano, and with this apartment, we were finally able to accommodate a piano in our space. We removed a wooden plank which the previous owners had used as a desk and created a nook which was a perfect spot for an upright piano.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Creating the pocket door separating the dining area from the bedroom proved a bit of a challenge at first, but our contractor helpfully suggested that we attach three store-bought doors together, and then build a fake wall over what used to be the space for the barn door. This would be a more affordable solution than purchasing a custom wood door, which he noted would be very expensive. We then painted the door and surrounding walls Hamilton Blue by Benjamin Moore, a color we had in our old apartment, and one that we knew looked good as a backdrop for our artwork. Also in the dining area, we covered a pipe that had previously been exposed. We had initially wanted to get rid of it since it was in the middle of the walkway, but this was not possible. Our unit was originally two apartments that had been combined at some point in the past, and the pipe had been inside the dividing walls.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathrooms probably required the most work. Our designers initially suggested moving around the placement of the sink and toilet to maximize space, but this was going to require additional permits and more time. As such, we ended up leaving the tubs, sinks, and toilets in the same places, and just upgraded with new fixtures. I love taking baths so we got deep-soaking tubs for both bathrooms, as well as <a href="https://www.totousa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toto toilets</a>. For the master bath, I was inspired by the clean, elegant look of hotel bathrooms and wanted marble walls to be a focus of that space. We opted for a glass panel on the tub, which our contractor sourced for us. We also covered unattractive heating pipes with grates from <a href="https://www.archgrille.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Grille</a>. Custom shelving was added in the form of a shower niche, as well as a large in-wall cabinet opposite the sink.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the guest bath, a simple white tile with black grout was chosen to complement the Coyuchi shower curtain and an Of a Kind planter we had brought from our previous bathroom. We ran into some issues with the tiles purchased by our designers for the guest bath, so our contractor made suggestions that helped the material work in the space. Contemporary <a href="https://www.graff-designs.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graff shower fixtures</a> were selected for both showers. As for the color palette, we chose white because it was a neutral color, and it is just very soothing to have a white bathroom. Both looks are timeless, and we figured they would be appealing to us now and hopefully to anyone who bought the apartment later on.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the four months of work, we were able to move into our new space, which we now love. We tried to create a contemporary space that reflects our personal tastes while adding elements which also capture the Art Deco heritage of our apartment building.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When advertising executives Lia and Chris Wollen made the leap to homeownership, they didn’t have to go far. A waterfront condo, just four blocks from their Williamsburg rental, called to them with bridge views and appealing amenities. After envisioning the possibility of a townhouse, square footage in the two-bedroom was a concern, but with a stunning kitchen and bathroom renovation, plus strategic spending and saving in a few key spots, Sweeten helped them make this home their own (with time to spare for the arrival of a new baby this winter!). Read on for Lia’s take on this beautiful project.</em></p>

</span>Guest post by Williamsburg homeowner Lia Wollen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After three years of renting in Williamsburg, the time came to try and buy a place. My husband, Chris, and I hoped to find a spacious townhouse or something bigger than our current place. Planning for a family and wanting outdoor space, we felt that broadening our search to less trendy neighborhoods was our only option. After exploring most of Brooklyn, however, we found that we kept coming back to Williamsburg.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Six months into our search, standing just four blocks south of our rental and looking out at the East River from the roof deck of a two-bedroom on the market, Chris said, “Well, if we can do this, then I want this.” It was a top floor unit with a small terrace off the living room, high ceilings, tons of light, and views of the Domino Sugar Factory, the river, and Manhattan. It came with basement storage, a parking space, and a piece of the private roof deck. Square footage was a concern, and we agreed that we would have to do a renovation before moving in to accommodate long-term needs, but first, the offer. Ours was accepted.</p>
<p>I found Sweeten in a general contractor search online and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filled out the project post form</a> to be matched with general contractors. Not too long after that initial search, I saw a blog post like this one, of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another gorgeous Sweeten renovation</a>. One of the photos looked right out at the Domino Sugar Factory—a replica of our new view! I realized pretty quickly it was a condo from our building and emailed Sweeten to ask them for the contractor. They connected us with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>. We met with him to kick things off and were thrilled with the fit and his vision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-56286 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02.jpg" alt="Kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56285 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01.jpg" alt="Bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The focus of our renovation was the kitchen and bath. I love to cook and wanted a hard-working, welcoming space to gather in. The bathroom needed a feeling of calm, an escape from the city. Our contractor was strategic with us in his approach. He started big so that we could see the possibilities, and then collectively, we pulled each other back to set reasonable expectations. This process was critical when it came to prioritizing our wants and needs and managing the dollars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We underestimated the significance of overall design in renovating, but it was the beautiful and technical unifier underneath everything we were trying to accomplish. The contractor addressed the kitchen simply: hide the fridge, fill in the odd angles and edges of the ceiling, and provide more counter/storage space. This blew our minds. It cleaned up the whole space and looked like a kitchen that meant to be there, rather than an afterthought.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The most exciting proposal from our contractor was to open up the ceiling and expose building beams that were encased in the walls of the kitchen and living room. This eliminated awkward lines and revealed some industrial elements, playing off of the raw materials mirrored across the street at Domino. We achieved separation of living room and kitchen while retaining warmth in the space, by limiting how far we (and our budget) extended the look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another small but important detail was the flooring. The contractor and his team buffed out the overly lacquered yellow floors to get back down to raw wood, and we chose a sky gray matte stain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were other more indulgent decisions made during the planning process, like a wine fridge. This felt like a low-cost, high-impact amenity you don’t typically get in the city and we were very excited about it. Chris insisted from day one that we have a garbage disposal, so that was non-negotiable. We also debated and ultimately agreed to a waterfall edge for the kitchen countertops. Our contractor had strongly recommended this as a focal point when entering the home, and he was absolutely right.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the bath, we kept the tub, sink, and hardware, but had everything retiled. We used leftover marble from the kitchen for the tub and installed a glass shower partition to open up the small space. We also built a new medicine cabinet and drawer for the sink to accommodate storage, and I found some new light fixtures to modern it up a bit.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris and I have a very similar aesthetic, so choosing materials, appliances, and fixtures was pretty straightforward. Before construction, I spent a lot of time pulling looks and materials from home and design websites, so we had a strong point of view right away. My must-have was a Wolf Range with the iconic red knobs. Snobby, kinda, but an important design element in an otherwise minimalist kitchen. The thing is also a weapon! (Chris started a grease fire the first time we used it.) Keeping in line with the stainless steel, we also bought a new Bosch dishwasher.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Material choices included Carrara marble, beveled and plain white subway tile with dark grout, classic New York hex tile in the bath, Edison bulbs, and glossy white cabinets. We chose IKEA cabinets because of another Sweeten renovation I caught on Instagram. It was very important to me that the cabinets went as high as they could go. I wanted an excess of clean-looking storage space and was not interested in dusting open shelving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56287 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowners in their renovated kitchen" width="1000" height="1494" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01-600x896.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were easy-going clients who trusted our contractor and his vision. We made things easier by not changing our minds and being open to his direction when we were undecided on something. The biggest decision, which we labored over the longest, was whether or not the kitchen should remain galley-style. The choice is obvious now, but there was something tempting at the time about toeing that suburban-house line with a big island to gather around. After the renovation, any concerns with square footage more or less went away. More, because we made so much out of what existed, and less because in March we found out we are expecting a baby boy this month!</p>
