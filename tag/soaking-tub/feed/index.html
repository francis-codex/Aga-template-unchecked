<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Turn a must-do gut reno into a custom primary bath remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When they bought the Spanish Revival Mediterranean in South L.A.’s Park Mesa Heights, they’d pulled off a victory: a first-time home purchase in SoCal. But Liz and Kevin’s 1923 house had a secret: water damage beneath the primary bathroom floor, thanks to a shower pan installed incorrectly a decade before. “To deal with it,” said Liz, the executive director of an education nonprofit, “we needed to take the bathroom down to the studs.” With this, Liz and Kevin started <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning for a bath remodel</a> in their L.A. home.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-12-1.jpg" alt="orange tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-47469 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-12-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-12-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-12-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Liz and Kevin, a technical production senior manager, viewed the dank discovery as an opportunity “to add storage and maximize space,” Liz said. But also to showcase their style. The two Mid-Century enthusiasts, who live with daughters Omari and Naiobi, love each piece they’ve hand-picked for the 1,850-square-foot home; they wanted elements of the era in <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new bathroom</a> as well. When they happened on a vintage-modern walnut dresser they liked, Liz envisioned it in a new role as a vanity. “We purchased it without knowing what the conversion would entail,” she said. <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finding a contractor</a> who could turn it into a sink while retaining drawer space below was key to their search. </span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="s1">“The crew was on time, and clear about decisions they needed to be made,” Liz said. “Staying on the same page with your contractor ensures your project is executed precisely and saves you money.”</span></p></blockquote>
<h3>A general contractor that&#8217;s the right fit</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Liz had already received bids from two recommended contractors, she said, but neither wanted to do the dresser/vanity retrofit. “I wondered if I might have a different experience communicating with a woman contractor if only I could find one,” remembered Liz. Then she came across <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, <span class="s2">posted their project,</span> and was matched with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woman-owned contracting firm</a>. “Her bid came in lower than the others,” Liz said, “and her communication was more clear and direct.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Build an on-trend bathroom with vintage-modern flair</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With a general contractor who’d take on the vanity challenge now checked off, Liz turned to other essentials. They would deal with the water stagnating under the floor. The room would also have a clean, uncluttered, and functional aesthetic. Spa-like, but not sterile. “It’s a bathroom,” she said, “not a museum!”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="free-standing-bathtub-with-gold-faucet" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-03.jpg" alt="free standing bathtub with brushed gold faucet and fixtures and white and gray floor tiles and light gray walls and pendant light after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-47379 size-full" style="font-size: 16px;" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3 class="p2">Creating a &#8220;wet room&#8221; feel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Initially, they planned for a seamless look—the same tile for the bath floor and shower floor, no curb. They’d discussed keeping the floorplan, but breaking out with a separate shower and soaking tub. The contractor suggested, however, that they move things around, repurposing the toilet alcove as a long, spacious stall comprising of a shower and tub. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They had chosen a large, vintage-feel tile which was fine for the bathroom floor but not the shower floor. </span><span class="s1">A small mosaic, instead, would allow a drainage slope, and a curb would be necessary to contain pooling water. “We struggled to get on board,” Liz said. “But once we did, it was smooth sailing.” Demolition revealed the water problem to be less serious than they’d feared. They were r</span>olling.</p>
<h3>Multiple showstopping designs</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dresser-turn-vanity plan proceeded. Liz found a high-rimmed, shallow trough sink that would float above the drawer space beneath. The sink’s height would also raise the low-sitting dresser up to standard vanity height. Brushed-brass faucets match the shower fixtures. Old-school, frameless medicine cabinets sit mounted on a wall of vibrant penny-round tile. (“The orange,” Liz said, “felt like a risk, but a little playful, like us.”) Milk-glass pendant lights complement the shape of the tiles. Swivel towel racks offer space to air-dry towels or clothing.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="bathroom-gold-faucet-and-fixtures" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-08-1.jpg" alt="bathroom gold faucet and fixtures and rectangular overflow cover after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-47465 size-full" style="font-size: 16px;" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-08-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-08-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-08-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3 class="p6"><span class="s1">Deliveries during a pandemic</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Putting pieces together proved perplexing. “This was our first renovation project and without a designer,” Liz explained. “<a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taking on that role</a> myself meant dealing with myriad decisions.” During a pandemic, it was harder. Shipping delays defied the contractor’s requirement that all finish materials be on-site before demolition could begin. “I wanted to see elements laid out before deciding,” Liz said, but plumbing or electrical couldn’t wait. By the time multiple pendants arrived for Liz to view over the tub, the electrician had already installed wiring for a previously planned recessed light. “We paid to bring him back,” Liz said.</span></p>
<h3>Communicating with your contractor</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the job, the Sweeten general contractor was capable and professional. “The crew was on time, and clear about decisions they needed to be made,” Liz said, reminding renovators to also ask for the answers <i>they</i> need. “Staying on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same page with your contractor</a> ensures your project is executed precisely and saves you money.” The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reno cost $26,000</a> ($19,000 to the contractor, and $7,000 for finish materials), allowing Liz and Kevin to stay on budget. Since they’d been braced for costly water damage (and possibly mold) remediation, it felt like a fortunate break.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The final result was an absolute win. “The vanity, to me,” Liz said, “is the centerpiece of the room (even though most people comment on the soaking tub!). It makes our bathroom unique and adds warmth and depth.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Bonus: </b>Comparing bids can be frustrating. The couple’s brain saver: “Sweeten’s consultation phone call let me bring all my bids and talk them through with a trusted partner,” Liz said. “Sweeten helped me understand how to compare different line items, to think through what could be missing, and come up with clarifying questions to ask. Sweeten&#8217;s bid-leveling expert helped me look at payment terms and project management. This helped us feel confident about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signing our contract</a>.”</span></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27222 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Homeowners Ed and Alicia with their dog, Roxy" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After Roxy, a rescued Rhodesian ridgeback, joined their household, Alicia and Ed realized “a little more space in a laid-back neighborhood” would be a better fit for the family of three than Manhattan, where they were currently living. They set their sights on a 1,400-square-foot garden duplex in a Park Slope brownstone. They fell in love with the building, which had been converted to condos by a developer about a decade ago. Despite the high-end finishes that were chosen at that time, there were issues that had developed in the interim. The couple also wanted to bring the renovations in line with their tastes, and in a style more befitting a building dating from the turn of the last century. As Alicia put it, “We really just wanted to make the place something we loved coming home to at the end of each day. What we had wasn’t awful, but it wasn’t terribly practical either<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>we had mismatched countertops, cracked tiles in the bathroom, a lack of counter space in the master bath, and most importantly, no space in the fridge to store our wine. The place just lacked the ‘wow’ you would expect from a building this pretty.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached out to Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors—for <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a>. For the couple&#8217;s custom kitchen renovation, Christina, their Sweeten Planner, was present at regular site visits and contractor meetings, providing detailed progress reports. Initially, the couple intended to focus their time and money on the kitchen. Instead, they also updated the guest and master bathrooms executing an overall vision<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>“a muted, classic design with a modern twist.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, this meant replacing the mismatched countertops as well as the cabinet fronts, and creatively finding space for a built-in wine fridge. Ed and Alicia knew that when the kitchen was renovated a decade ago the developer had used top-of-the-line materials, from custom Italian cabinetry to Viking, Miele, and Liebherr appliances; the space didn’t need a gut, simply a refresh. The downside of the custom Italian kitchen, however, was that none of the cabinetry was standard-sized. Refacing was a custom job, pushing out timelines, but it meant they could keep all the existing built-in shelving and customized organization that would have been extremely expensive to replace. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Countertops</a> resembling marble from Caesarstone unified the space and were chosen for their hardiness and durability. Ed had always wanted waterfall-edge countertops, which completed the look perfectly.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27225 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27227 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Chalkboard wall and wine fridge under the stairs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They had hoped to replace a smaller-than-usual refrigerator, as well as add a wine fridge. But the floor plan wouldn’t afford them the space for a larger unit, so they focused on adding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wine fridge</a> instead. Working with their Sweeten contractor, Ed and Alicia poked exploratory holes in the drywall underneath their stairs. Happily, they discovered that a 36-bottle dual zone wine fridge would fit in the space without making any structural changes. “It&#8217;s a luxury you would never think you could have in New York. We painted the surrounding wall with chalkboard paint<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>it’s a great way to leave notes for each other, plan out our grocery list, and try out some amateur artwork,” they said. &#8220;As a bonus, we found the current kitchen fridge is more than large enough for our needs.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The downstairs bathroom was next on the list<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>it already had a great soaking tub, but the vanity and medicine cabinet were outdated. The tiles, too, were showing their age. Alicia had always loved the feel of a traditional New York City bathroom<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>penny tile floors, subway tile, and a classic black-and-white color palette. They replaced the sink with a trough style: “There was debate whether the sink would be too large, but after lots of measuring and imagining how close it would be to someone using the shower or toilet, we decided to do it. We are so glad we did. It is a perfect fit. We also went for the matching faucets and soap dish.” Having forgone <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> under the new sink, they added a small shelf and a 1940s American Red Cross medicine cabinet (found online in Bulgaria!). The large closet just outside of the bathroom made up for the limited storage. Lastly, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-hung-toilets-look-behind-scenes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall-hung toilet</a> was a lot of trouble to install, but ultimately worth the effort, since it’s incredibly easy to keep clean and makes the room feel larger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Living_Room_During-Watermarked-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27469 size-chrono" title="during: dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Living_Room_During-Watermarked-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27228 mb-0 size-chrono" title="exposed brick wall in the dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the renovation of the downstairs bath, the contractor discovered that there was preserved exposed brick along one wall. They hoped that the brick was in the same condition a few feet away in the living room, and asked the contractor to rip down the sheetrock where their dining table would sit. “It turns out we were in luck. The brick looked wonderful, and though we had to unexpectedly reroute some electrical cables and find matching oak to patch up the flooring, it was worth all of the expense and impact on the timeline.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27234 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-14-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27233 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom shower and tub" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-13-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the couple also decided to renovate the master bathroom upstairs. (One of the pluses of living through your renovation is that you can figure out what else needs work while the contractor is on-site!) Since Alicia and Ed moved in while the renovation was still ongoing, they lived with the space for a while and found the bath to be unsuitable in many ways. “The overhead lighting was terrible, and the illuminated mirror died the day after we closed on the apartment. There was the complete lack of shelf space for us to set things down while getting ready, and the leaking pipework rendered the vanity useless for storage. The space really felt unloved.&#8221; To give the room a facelift without breaking the budget, they kept the large soaking tub (same as the one downstairs), the flooring, and toilet. A new white shaker vanity with a marble countertop provided ample storage while an illuminated medicine cabinet and built-in LED lights lit up the room. Adding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass panel</a> in place of the old shower curtain opened the space up. Lastly, a herringbone wallpaper from Ferm Living took the master bath to the next level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They made the home “<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-appliances-worth-hype/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smarter</a>,” by adding outlets in convenient locations for their <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sonos</a> sound system, converting regular to USB outlets where appropriate, adding a video intercom, and installing a full <a href="https://nest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nest</a> thermostat and smoke detector system. Now, they can control the temperature via Amazon Echo (thanks, Alexa!) and ensure that the apartment is a comfortable temperature for Roxy while they are away.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Stairs-During.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27241 mb-0 size-chrono" title="during: Roxy on the stairs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Stairs-During-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="During" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although they’d hoped to finish the renovations prior to their move-in date, they ended up <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living through the entire renovation</a>, which lasted four weeks from beginning to end. The toughest part, according to Alicia and Ed, was keeping Roxy out of trouble. (See above.) Their advice to future renovators? “Find a contractor you trust, and take their advice on what things would work well and what to avoid. We used tools like Pinterest, the Sweeten blog, and other online tools to get ideas. Also, if you have space, try to keep some spare materials once you have completed your renovation. We spent a long time trying to find a flooring that matched our current style to patch in around the exposed brick wall. We decided to buy an extra pack this time and store it in our basement in case of emergency. The same thing with all the tile. You never know what could happen in the future<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>for a few hundred dollars, it is worth the investment and peace of mind!”</p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Carroll Gardens homeowner Kim Solop </span></i></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After ten years of living in our Carroll Gardens condo, we really needed a change. We contemplated a move to the suburbs or upgrading to a bigger place in a less popular Brooklyn neighborhood. After almost a year of looking and being priced out in our current neighborhood, we decided to renovate our current place, a two-bed, two-bath, 1,200 square-foot condo that we bought in 2006. We loved our current neighborhood with its proximity to our workplaces, lots of cute restaurants, shops, and our two sons’ schools. The problems were in the apartment itself: I was unhappy with the dark kitchen—I always had been. I love taking baths but hated the jet tub that was installed over a decade ago. Lastly, our laundry closet had a lot of wasted space and I wanted to add a walk-in pantry!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a big fan of home decor blogs, I had been stalking the Sweeten site for a while, and really loved seeing the transformations that the contractors could do with space. I was excited for the chance to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/15462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our renovation</a>. I met with a couple of them, and decided on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>. I really clicked with the project managers and could see that we would have a good partnership.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My main objective for the kitchen was to brighten it up and eliminate the space between the cabinets and the ceiling. I hated how this wasted space looked and the amount of dust it collected. After a few weeks of sourcing materials, we were ready to go! I knew from the get-go that I wanted a white kitchen, as well as shaker-style cabinets with quartz countertops that were marble look-alikes. Other than that, I was pretty open to ideas. Our contractor came over with a wealth of ideas for how we could open the kitchen up to maximize light. (Unfortunately, there are no windows in the kitchen, so there was only so much we could do.) I debated another set of cabinets on top of the current ones, but eventually decided against it. I switched gears a bit on the white color palette, choosing instead a dual-tone kitchen with white uppers and gray lower cabinets. After living with long pulls, I decided to go with smaller handles on all the cabinetry. Quartz countertops were also a must, for the durability factor! With two kids and a husband who are not always the neatest, I knew that we needed a tough work surface. I was adamant about getting a wine fridge. As members of a few wine clubs, we struggled to find space to keep our wine at the right temperatures.</p>

<p>Our microwave above the range was replaced with a microwave drawer, and a hood was installed above the stovetop instead. With the new wine fridge taking up precious cabinet space, I did lose a place for pots and pans. Our contractor was able to give me deep drawers in the pantry to make up for this lost storage. My other kitchen must-haves were a deep, white porcelain sink, and an under-counter pull-out garbage can.</p>

<p>Across the kitchen was a room that held just the washer and dryer with inaccessible space that was wasted. When we extended the wall, there was room for a customized pantry with countertops, shelving, and cabinetry that matched the kitchen. After not having a pantry for so long, it’s amazing to have one, and the additional space has really been a lifesaver. I had envisioned barn doors, but there was not enough wall space for it. The double doors we ended up hanging looked so plain and boring. I had some wallpaper left over from the hallway&#8211;so I went for it and covered the doors too. I think it turned out nicely.</p>

<p>For the bathroom, I wanted a totally new look that was modern and clean. We went with dark floors, a deep soaking tub, and a floating vanity. Our contractor showed me a picture of another bathroom he did, and I loved it so much, we copied it almost exactly. It came out perfectly and I am fighting my older son almost daily for baths! The tub is divine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We actually lived in the space during the whole renovation, which lasted about seven weeks. It was definitely challenging and required a lot of patience. The contractor and his crew were great about cleaning up, however, and we made the best of it with lots of takeout dinners.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading the Sweeten blog for so many years, it was exciting to embark on my own renovation. I realized that renovating is messy and dirty, and almost always takes longer than you had originally anticipated. You learn to roll with the punches, and realize that things happen. We had a few hiccups along the way, such as wanting the barn door on the pantry that wasn’t going to work, so I learned to compromise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoyed working with our Sweeten contractor,  who made himself available at all hours. He was in constant communication and has remained a friend to this day. We love our new kitchen and other improvements, and are planning on staying to enjoy them for many years to come!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When they began looking for more space, Chelsea residents Lauren and Ross didn’t want to move far from their Manhattan neighborhood. Luckily, they found a new home in Kensington House, an Art Deco co-op building just three blocks from their old place. The two-bed, two-bath apartment featured plentiful space for entertaining—a must for Lauren, a food industry professional, as well as the perfect nook for Ross’ piano. The baths in this Emory Roth-designed building were true to their 1930s roots, with out-of-style tiling, industrial flushometer toilets, and exposed radiator pipes that were an unattractive hazard. The couple tapped the interior design firm White Arrow to create hotel-inspired baths with more storage. Read also about their choice for color and a unique, space-saving pocket door solution.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband, Ross, and I purchased a two-bedroom apartment in Chelsea last year. We were already living in a one-bedroom apartment in the same neighborhood and wanted to upgrade to an apartment that had more space. After about three months of looking, we found the perfect apartment, only three blocks from where we were living.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the loft-style layout of the apartment we found, but the bathrooms were in a bit of a sorry state. The tile was outdated and one of the baths had a huge old-school metal tub stopper located next to the toilet. So we planned on gutting the two spaces along with a few extra upgrades, such as replacing the kitchen’s backsplash and lighting, sanding the floors, repainting the apartment, removing a desk in the study to accommodate a piano, and turning a less-than-ideal barn door in the dining foyer into a more discreet pocket door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We hired <a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Arrow</a>, a friend’s sister’s design company to assist us with the design process, and they, in turn, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our contractor</a>. Our Sweeten contractor was also very helpful throughout the design process and suggested modifications and tweaks to the original design that best fit our needs.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">Creating a wide barn pocket door proved to be a challenge but &#8220;our contractor suggested we attach three store-bought doors together&#8230;&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We initially budgeted two to three months for the renovation process, and typical for New York, ended up taking about four months. The apartment’s previous tenants took all of their light fixtures with them when they moved out, so we purchased new light fixtures for all of the rooms. I created a Pinterest board to help refine my ideas. We especially love the distinctive CB2 chandelier which hangs above our dining room table.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being a food writer and having written <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Kitchens-Behind-Burner-Hanoi/dp/B00AK2TMOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four Kitchens</a></em>, a book about working in restaurants around the world, it was important for me to have a clean, streamlined kitchen for cooking and entertaining. We loved the custom cabinets that were already in place but wanted to update the backsplash by installing white subway tiles to replace the existing small red-and-brown multicolored ones. We also swapped out the sink faucet for a contemporary Grohe fixture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ross loves playing piano, and with this apartment, we were finally able to accommodate a piano in our space. We removed a wooden plank which the previous owners had used as a desk and created a nook which was a perfect spot for an upright piano.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Creating the pocket door separating the dining area from the bedroom proved a bit of a challenge at first, but our contractor helpfully suggested that we attach three store-bought doors together, and then build a fake wall over what used to be the space for the barn door. This would be a more affordable solution than purchasing a custom wood door, which he noted would be very expensive. We then painted the door and surrounding walls Hamilton Blue by Benjamin Moore, a color we had in our old apartment, and one that we knew looked good as a backdrop for our artwork. Also in the dining area, we covered a pipe that had previously been exposed. We had initially wanted to get rid of it since it was in the middle of the walkway, but this was not possible. Our unit was originally two apartments that had been combined at some point in the past, and the pipe had been inside the dividing walls.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathrooms probably required the most work. Our designers initially suggested moving around the placement of the sink and toilet to maximize space, but this was going to require additional permits and more time. As such, we ended up leaving the tubs, sinks, and toilets in the same places, and just upgraded with new fixtures. I love taking baths so we got deep-soaking tubs for both bathrooms, as well as <a href="https://www.totousa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toto toilets</a>. For the master bath, I was inspired by the clean, elegant look of hotel bathrooms and wanted marble walls to be a focus of that space. We opted for a glass panel on the tub, which our contractor sourced for us. We also covered unattractive heating pipes with grates from <a href="https://www.archgrille.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Grille</a>. Custom shelving was added in the form of a shower niche, as well as a large in-wall cabinet opposite the sink.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the guest bath, a simple white tile with black grout was chosen to complement the Coyuchi shower curtain and an Of a Kind planter we had brought from our previous bathroom. We ran into some issues with the tiles purchased by our designers for the guest bath, so our contractor made suggestions that helped the material work in the space. Contemporary <a href="https://www.graff-designs.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graff shower fixtures</a> were selected for both showers. As for the color palette, we chose white because it was a neutral color, and it is just very soothing to have a white bathroom. Both looks are timeless, and we figured they would be appealing to us now and hopefully to anyone who bought the apartment later on.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the four months of work, we were able to move into our new space, which we now love. We tried to create a contemporary space that reflects our personal tastes while adding elements which also capture the Art Deco heritage of our apartment building.</p>
