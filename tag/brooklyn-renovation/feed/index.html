<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Mitzie and Jenifer bought their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-bedroom apartment in DUMBO</a>, they knew that a full home renovation was needed before moving in. A designer, Mitzie immediately started sketching out design plans and reached out to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a general contractor who could bring those plans to life. In the home renovation tips below, Mitzie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shares the couples&#8217; bedroom and kitchen renovation inspiration, and their experience working with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3918#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Sweeten general contractor</a> to improve the lighting in their new apartment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:05)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to our home. My name is Mitzie Wong. I live here with my partner Jenifer Harmon, who is a media executive. I&#8217;m a painter, designer, and co-founder of <a href="https://roarandrabbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roar + Rabbit</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:35)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to make the apartment feel very casual, yet luxurious. We had a budget in mind, so we were really careful about choosing the materials. We wanted it to feel very inviting and relaxing.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_41443" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41443" class="wp-image-41443 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16.jpg" alt="kitchen and living room, kitchen renovation, living room renovation, home renovation tips for kitchen and living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-41443" class="wp-caption-text">Photos by Kate Glicksberg for Sweeten</p></div>
<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 1: </strong>A waterfall island brings living spaces together</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:53)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we saw the kitchen initially, it was very boxy. There were lots of angles, the cabinets were jutting out, the counters were short and narrow, so we wanted to make the place a lot more cohesive. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went for a bigger island</a>, deeper with the cascading waterfall marble sides, so it would be a feature because it&#8217;s an open plan to the living room. And we unified everything by color. Being an open plan, it had to be a feature. We hid the freezer and the fridge behind the same colors as the cabinet to make it more unified. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44522 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03.jpg" alt="home renovation designs, home renovation sketches" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We used the same hardware on the drawers and the doors to make it more cohesive, to give it a lighter and brighter space, and we obviously brought the counter forward to give it more a generous sense of space. Because everything was so new looking, I wanted to put in a handmade tile to just soften it up, to give it some texture and some depth.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41431 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03.jpg" alt="bedroom, bedroom renovation, home renovation tips for bedrooms" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 2: Turn a plain wall into a colorful headboard</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (01:58)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a fairly new building, it&#8217;s only 12 years old, so we wanted to give the apartment some character. As you&#8217;ll see, there&#8217;s a lot of build-outs and recesses and weird angles in each corner. I wanted to take the focal point away and make a feature wall. I used two-and-a-half-inch plywood beams and painted it to make an accent wall to give it layered depth. If you look slightly to the right, you&#8217;ll see the Manhattan bridge, and it&#8217;s a gray-blue, so that was part of the inspiration for the color. It&#8217;s a slightly off-color of the Manhattan bridge.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 3: </strong>Streamline storage and lighting</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (02:40)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We relied on our Sweeten contractor heavily on their expertise for lighting. They dropped the ceilings only two or three inches, and we were able to put in the recessed lighting in both the living room and the office, so we could maintain consistent lighting throughout the day and evening. When we were doing the initial renovation during the gutting stage, there was an additional six inches in the wall [of the master bathroom] that was revealed, so we were able to design together and build a bespoke cabinet.</span></p>

</ul>
<h3>A home with potential</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s incredible what you can do to a house without knocking down a wall. We had to look beyond a lot of challenges, 40-year-old decor, </span><span class="s1">an antiquated electrical system, and thin, stained wooden floors. But we saw something we could work with.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42954 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait.jpg" alt="renovators on couch with dogs" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43007 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior.jpg" alt="exterior 1920s house remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house had a great layout. We loved the open first floor, with its nine-and-a-half-foot ceilings and perfect flow—the foyer, living room, and dining room were all open but the spaces were distinct. The second floor lacked overhead lighting and had wood paneling in every room, but was accessed by a beautiful staircase. Potential! We knew we could make it modern while preserving its ‘20s spirit.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42944 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors.jpg" alt="Black double French doors, living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42945 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway.jpg" alt="remodeled foyer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Hidden architectural designs</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not that it would be easy. The family we bought the house from had owned it for 34 years and it had a very retro feel. We hoped that the layers of carpet and wallpaper might conceal architectural delights, but were disappointed that the few special details we uncovered, like parquet inlays, were beyond salvaging.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We knew that foundational work would eat most of the budget, with the floors and walls requiring considerable attention.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The initial scope that we listed out for Sweeten offered a basic overview of our project, listing last: “</span><span class="s3">Inspect/clean electrical panel.” We mentioned the possible need to replace or expand it, but didn’t realize how much work it would actually require. Finding out that we needed to replace all of the wiring</span><span class="s1"> was one surprise that our renovation served up. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We scheduled walk-thoughs to see the work at various stages, including&#8230;the electrical portion. Seeing exactly what had been done before the walls were closed up was informative and reassuring.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42951 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3.jpg" alt="living room renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Combining the old with new</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We didn’t move or remove a single wall but we did add French doors in the foyer to create a barrier to summer heat and winter cold. Because most of the first floor is open concept, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interior doors help to keep</a> the temperature even and comfortable year-round, while also creating a dramatic entry into our living space. [See more <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/home/photo-gallery/45749027/image/45749041/Modern-Meets-Country">inspiring living rooms here</a>.]</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">One of our goals was to build in details that appeared original. Where we could, we blended the old with the new that included a molding update. We complemented the existing molding on the stairs with new molding on the adjacent wall. </span><span class="s1">Our contractor matched the living room ceiling to the dining room’s original trim and a ceiling medallion was installed, a hint at deco design. It was in this room that the house finally gave us a gift. Our contractor unearthed a window hidden inside the dining room exterior wall—a lovely find that, with some attention, brought us a lot more light.</span></p>

<h3>Choosing the materials</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We stripped, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skim coated</a>, and painted the walls and redid two bathrooms investing in materials that would last. New floors were installed, windows were repaired, and energy-efficient ductless AC went throughout the house. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house felt instantly spacious and bright. The two things we were looking for in every choice we made: quality and classic style. From flooring and tiles to paint and different types of fixtures, we chose finishes we knew would last and look good for decades. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our color scheme, like everything else, is stark, graphic, and, most importantly, bright. White with the occasional swath of black feels timeless and pulls together everything from the foyer to the upstairs bath. A discreet beach vibe is there for those who look—low-key seashell references are hidden in a few small spots, a nod to the fact that we&#8217;re a 25-minute walk from Marine Park.</span></p>

<h3>Getting things done to code</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We wound up doing nearly twice as much work and extending our schedule to four times the original plan. We spent a little over $120,000, including materials, a four-month apartment rental, and contractor costs. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">We were scrupulous about everything being done to code. Our Sweeten contractor had great communication skills and sent updates, photos, and videos via WhatsApp. We scheduled walk-throughs to see the work at various stages, including the point when the electrical portion was complete. Seeing exactly what had been done before the walls were closed up was informative and reassuring. As a civil engineer, Luke was heavily focused on ensuring that the electrical, plumbing, and structural elements were sound.</span></p>

<h3>An extensive renovation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This renovation taught us a lot! It wasn’t our first experience, but our biggest by far. We used many subcontractors, including electricians, HVAC specialists, plumbers, hardwood flooring installers, and plaster experts, and asked a lot of questions about the best processes, the ideal order for tasks, and how to complete them on a reasonable schedule. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The best part of the renovation? Seeing the “after” months later, after being so overwhelmed by the “before”! We didn’t gut the house, but we came close. The difference is dramatic. We are absolutely thrilled.</span></p>

Ditch a clunky layout. Add a kitchen island. And do it before the baby arrives. Those were Tara and Brian’s four main renovation goals after they bought a two-bedroom co-op (with a small office space) in Park Slope, Brooklyn. The prewar apartment was an upgrade in space and number of bedrooms from their previous rental as the couple prepared to start a family.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40338 mt-24 size-full" title="family portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40323 size-full" title="kitchen before renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01.jpg" alt="kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40332 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">It’s a shallow pantry, but it is enormously useful.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>However, it was outdated. Oak cabinets in the kitchen and patterned tiles in the bathroom, all from the &#8217;90s, made the room feel old. A kitchen peninsula awkwardly dissected the eating area and living room. The fridge took up prime real estate, blocking light from the apartment’s rear. “The previous owners had lived there for eight years and hadn’t really updated it,” Tara said. They decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted contractors, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-101/meet-the-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose a general contractor.</a></p>
<p>The couple decided to do most of the renovation before moving in so Tara, who was pregnant at the time, wouldn’t inhale any dust. Once the water was connected and the messy work complete, Brian and Tara took up residence while their contractor worked around them.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40337 size-full" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40326 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen storage and integrated refrigerator" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02.jpg" alt="kitchen storage and integrated refrigerator" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>For Tara, adding that <span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> island was non-negotiable and it turned out to be one of the crowning glories of the renovation. Their contractor had a reclaimed wood supplier in Pennsylvania and the couple picked out a big slab of walnut. They went for a rustic look, leaving two sides with a live edge and enhanced the wood’s cherry red tone with a lacquer. “<span style="color: #333333;">I remember when I was a kid, the kitchen island was the center of existence,” she said, adding that now when they have friends over, that still proves true.</span></p>
<p>Their contractor suggested a workaround for the refrigerator. The area already had three big clunky closets across from the main kitchen. Why not match those closets to the new cabinets in the kitchen and hide the fridge in there? It turned into a perfect solution that helped the flow of space between the living room, kitchen and the back of the apartment.</p>

The new kitchen layout had a few feet of wall space that wasn’t serving any purpose other than be covered in the white subway tiles Brian and Tara picked for their backsplash. The contractor saw the potential for a small pantry. When it’s shut, it looks like a tiled wall. But pop the magnetic doors open, and a 10-inch deep cabinet is revealed. “<span style="color: #333333;">It’s a shallow pantry, but it is enormously useful,</span>” said Tara. “Our friends think it is so cool.”</p>
<p>To create a sense of openness in the kitchen, Tara and Brian ditched the cabinets above the counter <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-shelves-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in favor of open shelving</a>. Their contractor used the walnut from the new kitchen island to create the shelving. The red proved the perfect accent of color and texture to the couple’s color palette of black and white.</p>

<p>Sticking closely to that color scheme, Tara wanted a darker stain with a matte finish on the wood floors. Brian thought it needed more gloss. “We spent a lot of time figuring out what stain to use,” Tara said. “My husband eventually came around.”</p>

Of everything in the renovation, making a decision on what <span style="color: #333333;">bathroom</span> faucets to install took the most time. Tara wanted something modern and functional. Brian had a strong view that it should have one handle instead of two. In the end, they found something “that we both didn’t hate,” Tara said.</p>
<p>She also felt strongly in favor of a glass partition rather than a shower curtain, “to make the space look bigger.” Brian pointed out the difficulties of maneuvering around a partial glass barrier when bathing their soon-to-arrive infant. To get on the same page on the glass, Tara volunteered to take the lead on baby bathing responsibilities. “At the moment she is still getting washed in the kitchen sink because it is so big,” she said.</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">If we thought creatively, we could make the most of all the space that would otherwise have gone unused.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The renovation hit a snag when their general contractor uncovered some serious water damage to the bathroom flooring. The couple had planned on keeping the original bathtub since they thought it was in pretty good shape. This new discovery meant they needed a new one. On the bright side, it gave Tara the chance to cross something off her “want” list: a bath with a tiled side.  “<span style="color: #333333;">Our contractor was very upfront with what was needed and what the cost would be,” Tara said, of the mid-project pivot. “He gave us options of what to do about it.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40331 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07.jpg" alt="study" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />The walnut wood turned into the gift that kept giving. After completing the kitchen, their contractor used the remainder to create three small shelves in the bathroom. With some wood still unused, he carved up more shelves for the <span style="color: #333333;">office</span>.</p>
<p>The renovation took three months to complete. During the project, Brian and Tara communicated often with their Sweeten contractor via text message and in person. “He was so great because we would text with him and he would keep us up-to-date even on minor details,” Tara said.</p>
<p>The couple also learned the art of compromise during the process. “Brian had to remind me of what was practical even if I really wanted something,” Tara said. But at the same time, don’t be afraid to get creative, she advised. The secret pantry behind a tiled wall and walnut shelving in the bathroom are two examples of making inspired decisions on the go. “<span style="color: #333333;">We realized if we thought creatively,” said Tara, “we could make the most of all the space that would otherwise have gone unused.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A couple reconfigures their living space for a new family addition</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27564 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Idalee, Danny, and baby" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-01-723x526.jpg" alt="second bedroom nursery" width="723" height="526" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When work started, Idalee, 25 weeks pregnant, and her husband, Danny, had a natural deadline to turn their one-bedroom apartment into two bedrooms. Previously, the couple, along with their dog Maxie, squeezed into a studio for four years to save for their first home purchase. They found themselves leaning towards co-op buildings in Clinton Hill, which provided larger living spaces as well as more modern features (at least more modern than a prewar apartment). “We fell in love with the neighborhood and the flexibility the spaces had with converting the apartments,” said Daniel. That was in 2015. Since then they have been planning their renovation as well as starting a family.<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-FLOORPLAN-before.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27588 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-FLOORPLAN-before-723x482.jpg" alt="before" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_New_Floor_Plan_Watermarked.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27874 size-chrono" title="new floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_New_Floor_Plan_Watermarked-723x482.jpg" alt="new floor plan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a>The goal of the renovation was to simultaneously create a nursery from a small dining space off the living room while opening up the apartment to be more conducive to entertaining, as well as fix water-damaged floors. They turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor from Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted contractors. “We wanted to optimize the small square footage of the space and ideally achieve unobstructed sightlines throughout,” said Daniel. The couple was intent on incorporating a mid-century look in the decor and furniture. Above all, they needed to do all this within their budget and in time for the baby’s arrival. They were fortunate enough to live with family nearby, “but we can’t imagine what things would have been like if we had to live in the space during the renovation,” said Daniel. The close proximity allowed them to check in on the progress of their renovation about once a day.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/brooklyn-couple-adds-nursery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen was the biggest part of the renovation. In the original design, a cupboard stood between the kitchen and the living space. As glorious as storage is in an apartment, it had to be sacrificed in order to connect the kitchen to the living room. Luckily, there was dead space near the front door entryway and the couple’s Sweeten contractor was able to carve out a storage closet. Huge drawers in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a>, as well as cabinets that went to the ceiling, also made up for lost storage. And of course, “a little <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/marie-kondo-closet-organizing-cleaning-konmari-spark-joy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marie Kondo</a>-style purging” helped limit what actually needed to be stored.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing kitchen aesthetic was bland with pine cabinets and a sad beige countertop. For the new look, Daniel and Idalee went for a modern and industrial design that would blend with the more mid-century look of the living room in a color mix of white and grays. This was reflected in the kitchen <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tiles</a>, where the couple had a bit of fun. “I would say that our kitchen floors are one of our favorite aspects,” said Daniel, ”since we didn’t think we would be able to accomplish a mosaic tile floor with our budget.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an added bonus, the Sweeten contractor found a hidden power outlet near the kitchen window. “My husband does a lot of cooking and having an outlet allows us to use a fan to help regulate the temperature in the apartment,” said Idalee. Their contractor also helped the duo decide where new power sources should go, especially since walls and outlets were removed during the renovation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Daniel and Idalee worked with their architect Robert to place the walls and convert the dining room into a nursery. They opted for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass doors</a> to let the maximum amount of light into the living room. The glass also meant that they could keep an eye on their newborn child from the next room. “When he gets older, we will put a curtain on the inside of the door that he can control and can ideally still let light through during the day,” said Idalee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The area near the front door with the new storage closet also needed a railing because of the lowered entryway. &#8220;We always knew we needed to add one when we had a child, so we included this as part of our renovation,&#8221; said Idalee. &#8220;The railing works great to section off the side of the stairs.&#8221; They also added a small white bench under the railing as a sitting area for putting shoes on and off. &#8220;It feels like a small mud room to us, which is nice to have in a small city apartment,&#8221; she said. </p>

<p>  Water damage to the original parquet floors needed to be fixed. With a little bit of luck, a neighbor who was also renovating was able to donate some old flooring to replace the damaged section. However, matching the rest of the older floor while patching up the problem area would be near impossible. Instead, the couple decided to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/repair-protect-wood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinish</a> the floors and change the shade from a golden oak to a dark walnut.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To find their stellar Sweeten contractor, Daniel and Idalee had some help from Sweeten Client Services; their advisor also offered to join phone calls with the couple and potential contractors. “We really can’t say enough about how great it was using the Sweeten service,” said Daniel. “Sweeten is certainly a fan favorite among the Clinton Hill co-ops.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though their renovation ran on time and within budget, it certainly was “nothing like you see on HGTV,” said Daniel. The one piece of advice the couple would give to those embarking on a renovation is simple: plan properly and start early.</p>
