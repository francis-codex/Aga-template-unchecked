<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/LA-Sustain-Image-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46464 mb-0 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-07.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Making the decision to renovate instead of constructing a new home is already the first step to green remodeling. Sustainable home building, which seeks to minimize construction waste while making homes more energy-efficient, is growing in popularity nationally. Sustainable home building and &#8220;green&#8221; renovations are also becoming easier, especially in eco-minded markets like L.A. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You don’t have to do a lot to make a big difference,” explained John Shipman from Build It Green. The non-profit developed the <a href="https://greenpointrated.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">GreenPoint Rated</span></a> label to help and reward homeowners and builders for sustainable construction and sustainable home renovations.</span></p>
<p>Sweeten lays out how to apply a &#8220;green&#8221; renovation in your own home. <span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Why should you do a sustainable home renovation? </b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Creating a &#8220;greener,&#8221; more sustainable home</span> <span class="s1">can be as simple as adding a low-flush toilet, which can cost as little as $100, according to Shipman. If you’re embarking on an extensive green remodeling project, it will cost approximately $20,000 more than a non-sustainable one. Keep in mind, however, that you will make up for it over time by saving on the electricity bill. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Think of taking on a green remodeling approach as an investment instead of an expense. Not only will you save on your energy bills, but your home will increase in value. Homes that carry a green certification, like GreenPoint Rated, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166046213000574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">sell faster and for about four to five percent </span></a>above market value, Shipman said. Another benefit: A sustainable renovation will likely provide a cleaner lifestyle, thanks to the use of non-toxic materials. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s4">A guide to green remodeling</span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Energy assessment</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Calling in an energy auditor is a great place to start your green remodeling project. It will lead to an efficient home, as well as make your sustainable home renovation productive and strategic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An energy assessment can involve a visual inspection as well as thermal imaging with infrared cameras to detect energy loss. A blower picks up on unwanted airflow through cracks surrounding entry points like windows as well as roofs. An assessment typically costs a few hundred dollars (see more about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/home-energy-audit-the-best-money-ive-ever-spent/2018/02/01/06643628-fbac-11e7-ad8c-ecbb62019393_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.99684b7fc41f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the process here</a>). It might be a worthwhile investment. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Passive design </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The layout of your home and everything under the hood—think airtight windows and insulation—have a huge impact on how effortlessly you will live a modern, sustainable life. It can also eliminate<span class="s2"> 30 percent </span>of <a href="https://www.sustainablelivingguide.com.au/make-your-renovations-green" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your household energy bills</a>. Here are some top sustainable building options to consider: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Home layout: </b>A significant part of passive design is the physical orientation of your house, and how that interacts with the seasons. If you’re embarking on a significant renovation, you may have the opportunity to consider where each living space goes. For example, you could reconfigure your living room, where you spend most of your daytime hours so that it faces south. This will give you maximum sun and heat during the winter, reducing your home heating costs.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Skylights</strong> are something else to consider to add natural light, said <a href="https://www.timothy-corrigan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timothy Corrigan</a>, a Los Angeles-based interior designer who has completed several sustainability projects in the area. So that there isn’t just a black hole at night where the skylight is, he suggested putting LED lights in the shaft. Covering the opening with an opaque filter creates some soft lighting.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The <strong>exterior color of your home</strong> will also make a difference, according to Timothy. If you’re in a warm climate, head towards light colors for a cooling effect. That’s one reason why a dark, even black home exterior is common in colder countries—it holds in heat. </span><b></b></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Landscaping:</b> W<span class="s2">hat trees you plant and where</span> can make a big difference. Deciduous trees provide shade during the summer and maximize heat and light during the winter when they shed their leaves. The best place to plant for this effect is on the south and west side of a structure. </span>Adding a green roof will also keep your home cool.</li>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Renovation materials for green living</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Are you planning to buy materials for a sustainable home renovation? Here are ways to go about sourcing new materials and reusing what you already own while mixing in your own creativity:  </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>The Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association’s</b> <a href="https://www.kcma.org/certifications/environmental-stewardship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Environmental Stewardship Program</span></a> guides consumers to the most sustainable cabinets. The program rates options on five categories including environmental stewardship and air quality. And it turns out that sustainability is one of the main reasons home renovators or builders choose a specific cabinet company. That’s a good hint for companies to produce greener cabinets.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Product Guides:</b> Build It Green’s <a href="https://greenpointrated.com/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">website</span></a> is a wealth of information on sustainable building materials, from plumbing to roofing to bathroom fixtures. Each section gives a detailed list of what to look for to ensure the materials are sustainable.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Deconstruct:</b> Instead of coming in with a big hammer and demolishing the interior of your home, take it slow and steady. Give yourself and your contractor a chance to see what can be repurposed or refurbished.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Sustainable renovation ideas: Resell and buy locally</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you don’t want to reuse anything, it’s likely someone else will. Nonprofits like <a href="https://renovationangel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Renovation Angel</span></a> and <a href="https://www.bigreuse.org/service/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Big Reuse</span></a> make that exchange very easy. They will haul away your old materials and appliances (after they assess its value), and then resell them. You get a donation tax write-off for whatever they take (plus, you don’t have to pay to send it to landfill.)</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Reusing:</b> Giving new life to what you already have is a simple way to reduce your renovation’s carbon footprint. For example, refinishing your existing cabinets with non-toxic paint could save you thousands on a kitchen renovation. Then there’s also refacing, where you keep the cabinet frame and switch out the doors as well as pulls, knobs, and hinges.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Reuse cuts down on a range of negatives like manufacturing and transportation emissions from producing something new. It will also reduce your remodel’s waste and help shrink your budget, too. That’s a win on many levels. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Reclaim:</b> Consider using local items previously used and not shipping barn wood across the country. It reduces the need to buy anything new, which means less raw material is stripped from the earth.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Sustainable renovation ideas: </b></span><span class="s1">Air sealing your home</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An incredible amount of energy is wasted when air either leaks out or gets in. Your heating system has to work much harder if there is a continuous draft from a crack between a door and the floor. Here are some simple, and not-so-simple, ways to air seal your house:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Caulking</span>: This material squeezes into small, stationary areas to prevent airflow coming through cracks and gaps and joints that are less than a quarter-inch.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Weatherstripping</span>: This is typically a foam or rubber material that can be cut to fit different dimensions. Unlike caulking, weatherstripping is for anything that moves, such as doors or windows.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Airtight drywall</span>: If you’re doing a significant renovation, this is the approach with the best outcome. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/air-sealing-your-home/air-sealing-new-home-construction"><span class="s2">Airtight drywall</span></a> seals joints, seams, and openings in your walls, doors, and windows during construction.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Sustainable renovation ideas</b></span><span class="s1"><b>: Low-E windows </b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Low-Emissivity glass allows a minimum amount of ultraviolet and infrared rays through your windows. The coating keeps the inside temperature consistent by keeping it inside and preventing it from escaping. About 30 percent of heating and cooling energy is lost through windows and doors. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Glass <a href="https://www.glass-rite.com/2012/03/14/what-are-low-e-windows-and-why-buy-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">absorbs</span></a> heat in the summer and cold during the winter, which puts pressure on your heating and cooling systems. The Low-E coating does double duty by reflecting energy from the outside and the inside. For example, in the summer, it reflects heat back to the sun and the cold from air-conditioning back inside the house. If your renovation calls for new windows, it’s your chance to either use Low-E windows or add a Low-E coating to what you already have.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Sustainable renovation ideas: </b></span><span class="s1"><b>Insulation</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Insulation will improve the efficiency of your home by trapping energy in. The outside weather has less impact on your inside temperature. However, some insulation products have certain advantages. Recycled cotton and cellulose insulation are made from 80 percent recycled materials, according to the <a href="https://greenpointrated.com/products/"><span class="s2">Build It Green</span></a> material guide. Companies such as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">CertainTeed, </span></a>use recycled glass so products meet the EPA’s Recovered Material Guidelines. This saves material from clogging up landfills while improving your home’s energy efficiency. When choosing your insulation material, be on the <a href="https://www.mychemicalfreehouse.net/2019/10/zero-voc-insulation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">lookout</span></a> for products that are free of VOCs and toxins. </span></p>
<p>Take steps towards green remodeling and sustainable renovation, and you&#8217;ll be on your way to a healthier home, planet, and wallet. <span class="s1">Happy (green) renovating! </span></p>

<p>I am not a tree-hugger. I like the idea of nature, but I like it best when witnessed from the confines of <a href="https://www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a lovely glass box</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless I&#8217;m studying for the <a href="https://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEED</a> accreditation exam, which demonstrates leadership in the design and construction of buildings that promote energy-efficiency and resource conservation. The exam covers a lot of dry technical information, and I&#8217;m undertaking it mostly because the credential has become de rigeur for architects. But all this studying has gotten me thinking more seriously about the facts underlying the formulae. I&#8217;m becoming increasingly ecologically-sensitive about the way I live and the products I use.</p>
<p>So more than six months after I completed my kitchen and bathroom remodel I&#8217;m feeling a load of green remorse, disappointment that I wasn&#8217;t more environmentally responsible when selecting products and finishes. So many building products claim that they&#8217;re &#8220;green&#8221; now that it&#8217;s easy to dismiss as a trendy marketing tactic. But each shift in product manufacturing and purchasing, however small, contributes to a much larger shift in consumption that can help us protect our resources.</p>
<p>Here are some things I&#8217;ll do differently the next time I remodel:</p>
<p><b>1. Water-conserving fixtures</b></p>
<p>I although I wasn&#8217;t aware of it at the time, my showerhead and bathroom faucet are designed to minimize water flow. The reduced flow doesn&#8217;t really affect the way the use them, because they have aerators that bolster the reduced flow with additional pressure. My old toilet, which I reused, has a 3-gallon tank. (Think of what a gallon of milk looks like. Isn&#8217;t that a lot of water?) Next time I&#8217;ll install a new toilet with a 1.6 gallon tank or with a dual-flush system that uses a full flush was only when needed.</p>
<p><b>2. Energy-saving appliances</b></p>
<p>The refrigerator, dishwasher and microwave I chose all have Energy Star ratings, which means that they meet or exceed that organization&#8217;s standards. Next time I&#8217;m shopping for appliances I&#8217;d like to compare ratings more closely and try to maximize savings.</p>
<p><b>3. Cabinetry without urea formaldehyde</b></p>
<p>Lots of the plywood and fiberboards used in cabinetry are built with glues that contain urea formaldehyde, a damaging VOC (volatile organic compound) that leaks into the air and into our lungs. When looking for kitchen cabinets next time, I&#8217;ll to find out whether they contain this compound and, if so, what the alternates are.</p>
<p><b>4. Salvaged pieces</b></p>
<p>I bought all of my products brand new. My kitchen is so small that I might have been able to find good wood cabinetry, a good sink, and stone countertops at a consignment shop. Using reclaimed products saves resources and diverts waste from landfills. <a href="https://www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Habitat for Humanity ReStore</a>, <a href="https://reclaimedhome.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reclaimed Home</a>, and <a href="https://unitedhousewrecking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United Home Wrecking</a> are all good places to hunt for spectacular finds.</p>
<p><b>5. Tiles manufactured locally or with recycled content</b></p>
<p>I chose tiles for the kitchen and bathroom without regard for where or how they were made. Next time I&#8217;ll try to source tiles that are manufactured locally, or that have some recycled content. Buying locally helps to prevent emissions from shipping. And many manufacturers that sell at large retailers, like <a href="https://americanolean.com/leed.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Olean</a>, are beginning to incorporate recycled materials into new product lines.</p>
<p><b>6. Low-VOC paint</b></p>
<p>Interior acrylic house paint contains VOC&#8217;s in acceptable, regulated quantities. But several popular companies are manufacturing lines of paint with specially reduced VOC content, like Benjamin Moore EcoSpec.</p>
<p><b>7. Efficient light fixtures</b></p>
<p>A big chunk of the electricity used in our country, about 20%, goes to interior lighting. When selecting undercabinet and ceiling light fixtures I was more concerned with the light quality than with the light source. But different bulbs use very different amounts of electricity. A simple way to save power and money is to choose lights with efficient halogens or LED bulbs, or to use fluorescent bulbs in incandescent fixtures.</p>
