<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Sharon and Laurence have lived in their Financial District apartment for 25 years. They moved to the area for more space and because, at that time, it was considered “off the radar.” Eight years ago, they renovated the kitchen but were hesitant to tackle the bathroom—mostly due to the logistics of living without one during a remodel. But the space was falling apart and they hardly used the tub, so it finally came to the point where a renovation was in order. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We felt confident with Sweeten when we learned that they had contractors that worked in New York City and were comfortable with the unique challenges of working in a co-op with its strict rules,” Sharon said. </span>They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/33282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to the platform and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="brown-vanity-under-white-sink"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48791 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sharon-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="Brown vanity under white sink and white toilet with tank before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sharon-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sharon-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sharon-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharon and Laurence had initially hoped to expand the 48-square-foot bathroom, but after investigating a “mystery space” behind a wall, they learned it wasn’t quite big enough to make a significant difference in the overall footprint. A debate also occurred over whether to install a new tub or move forward with just a shower since tubs are often a big selling point for buyers. Ultimately, they decided to go with a shower and replace all the fixtures and finishes to create a neutral, easy-to-clean, and minimalist bathroom.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-eGuEr6Y6U&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="proper-etiquette-video-link-image"  class="alignnone wp-image-40848 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-ProperEtiquette.jpg" alt="video link image of what is a proper etiquette by sweeten founder" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-ProperEtiquette.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-ProperEtiquette-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-ProperEtiquette-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their contractor recommended that in order to get the project done as quickly as possible, the homeowners should plan to have all the materials delivered and ready to install upon demolition. “We h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ave high-end aspirations with a down-to-earth budget so, to that end, we spent a considerable amount of time sourcing the best prices on fixtures that we liked,” Sharon said. The couple ran their choices by their contractor to make sure everything was compatible and found materials that aligned with their vision, including all-recessed lighting instead of separate sconces and large-scale tiles for the walls and floors.</span></p>

During demolition, their contractor encountered a waste pipe that ran horizontally not vertically—unlike many other jobs he’d worked on. The homeowners couldn’t return the toilet and had to pay a restocking fee, but their contractor went to a showroom with photos of the waste pipe to find a solution. Turns out, few manufacturers actually make toilets that fit horizontal waste pipes, but he found one for the homeowners to order. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of the work was near completion as delivery issues with the toilet cropped up (all out of the contractor and homeowner’s control.) After a fourth delivery—previous toilets arrived broken—they were able to make the final touches, including installing the glass shower door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through it all, Sharon and Laurence stayed in the apartment during the renovation, using a neighbor’s apartment for bathroom access. Even though it wasn’t ideal, the bathroom was cordoned off with plastic, and Sharon thought it was better to be living on-site anyways to deal with potential issues quickly and efficiently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the couple is very happy with their new bathroom. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our contractor was professional, responsible, and able work with us to get the job done in a timely manner considering the toilet problems,” Sharon said.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Sharon and Laurence’s apartment is in a former office building originally built in 1902!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<h3>Falling for a new Manhattan neighborhood</h3>
<p>Sonali, a consultant, and Shalaj, an investment banker, were initially unsure about their move to the Financial District in Manhattan, but soon found themselves falling in love with the neighborhood. “We enjoy going on long walks along the river and just exploring the shops and restaurants in the area,” Sonali said. One night, while walking their cocker spaniel, Tyson, the couple discovered the Southbridge Towers complex, which had recently been privatized. Although they hadn’t considered buying before, the building piqued their curiosity. They started going to open houses and putting in their bids but were outbid several times before finally being accepted for a 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom co-op. “Truth be told, we were not expecting our offer to get accepted!” Sonali said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36162 size-chrono" title="floor-plan-design-changes" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-Floorplan-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plan sketch of rooms before and after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-Floorplan-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-Floorplan-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-Floorplan-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-Floorplan.jpg 1084w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the two settled into their new roles as homeowners, they said, “reality hit” and they realized the apartment (with its original &#8217;70s design) would need a complete overhaul: a gut renovation. “We had no idea where to start,” Sonali said. Luckily, that’s when they found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post their Financial District renovation</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“We needed to renovate the entire apartment, including the removal of the original popcorn ceiling. We wanted a contractor who would not only handle all aspects of the renovation but also fit within our tight budget and schedule,” she said. The project would also include knocking down walls, which required permits from both their building and the city. They were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a> who was comfortable with their project scope and timeline.</p>

<h3>Expanding the kitchen, and compromising along the way</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sonali and Shalaj agreed that the most important change to tackle would be opening up the <span style="color: #000000;">kitchen</span>. “We both enjoy cooking and having friends over, so we knew we would be spending a lot of time in there,” Sonali said. They decided to remove a kitchen wall to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-plan-living-when-lounging-meets-dining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open the space</a> into the living room and make the whole apartment feel less cramped. They went with a white-on-white design, with white cabinets, a white subway tile backsplash, and white quartz countertops throughout (which Sonali called “exquisite”).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of installing a microwave over the gas range, they opted for a drawer-style instead. &#8220;It reminded Shalaj of years of renting!&#8221; Sonali said. Another item they really wanted was a Wolf gas range. &#8220;It was way beyond our stove budget, but when our contractor told us about a discounted floor model, we decided to splurge on it,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35881 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06-723x482.jpg" alt="Financial District, renovation, apartment renovation, home, design, construction" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An unexpected delight in the kitchen was the under-cabinet LED lights with dimmers, suggested by the contractor, which both added charm and accentuated the white subway tile backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the process, the couple found they had to compromise on certain elements. For example, because of the location of the gas line, they couldn’t move the stove away from the peninsula as originally planned. Sonali found the silver lining, though: “We like that the stove is in the peninsula now because it allows us to cook and interact with guests when we have them over!” They spent most of their effort and money on the kitchen. “We have not regretted any of our decisions yet,” she said.</p>

<h3>Adding closet space to the co-op</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next renovation priority was to double the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closet space</a> in the<span style="color: #000000;"> master bedroom by taking the adjacent guest bedroom&#8217;s closet; the second bedroom got a new one of its own built. “In our last rental, Shalaj was relegated</span> to the living room closet, so having enough storage space in the master bedroom was pretty high on his list of priorities,” Sonali explained. Shalaj wanted to install lights in their custom closets, but once they realized this addition would add thousands of dollars to their renovation costs, they decided to buy battery-operated lights instead.</p>

<h3>A bathroom refresh &amp; pet-friendly wooden flooring</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple decided to close up the living room closet and have it open inside the <span style="color: #000000;">bathroom</span>. This change added <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> to the bathroom and got rid of wasted space in the hallway. Like the kitchen, the bathroom was also mostly white. To add contrast and character, they installed black hexagonal floor tile. “We get complimented on it a lot!” Sonali said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the rest of the apartment, the contractor installed wide-plank, oak hardwood floors. Sonali described the color as “not too dark, not too light” and loves that it blends with Tyson’s fur—something relatable to any pet owner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-selecting-and-ordering-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">choosing materials</a>, Sonali said that the couple had no idea how many choices there would be or how much it could end up costing. That’s where their contractor came in: “To help us work through our sticker shock, our contractor had carefully built a list of items in three categories (budget, standard, and high-end) and supplied samples, to the extent possible. From there, our job was mostly to choose one of the three options provided, which made life so much easier for us,” she said.</p>

<h3>Lessons learned from the Financial District renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most stressful moment of the renovation came a week before the couple was supposed to move into their new apartment. None of the appliances had been installed, there was paper all over the floor, and the electrical work had not yet been started. Since they were unable to stay in their old apartment, they worried they might not have anywhere to go. The Sweeten contractor reassured them the process wasn’t very far behind schedule, and sure enough, they were able to move in on time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Our contractor took great control of the project, from getting building approval to ensuring that we could meet the move-in deadline.” She added, “We had heard horror stories about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how long renovations</a> can take, but working with an experienced and responsible contractor makes the process much smoother.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple’s advice to new renovators? “A friend of ours had advised us to set aside a 30% buffer on top of our budget. The advice came in handy as that was almost exactly the amount we went over by.” Extra costs included a few items outside the original scope such as replacing the AC unit and also spending more on kitchen materials than had been initially planned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sonali said, &#8220;We love our new space and feel lucky to find a home in our favorite neighborhood and to add our personal touch to the layout and materials.&#8221;</p>
