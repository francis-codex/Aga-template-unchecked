<h3>Modernizing a Brooklyn bathroom in a timeless way</h3>

<p><span>For Peggy and Jack, renovating the master bath in their circa late-1800s Brooklyn brownstone was an easy decision: they had leaks in the bathroom that couldn’t be ignored anymore. They were nearing the end of their twins’, Cayley and Sam, college careers, so they could refocus their financial commitments. The outdated pink-and-black tile and the oddly-placed shower also contributed to the necessary overhaul. They wanted to modernize their Brooklyn bathroom, but not load it with trendy design statements that’d be “out” in a few years. </span><span class="s10_overlay-text"></span></p>
<p><span class="s10_overlay-text"></span><span>Their Brooklyn brownstone is configured as an owner-occupied triplex and basement rental unit—and they have grand plans for the historic building in the future. “ We have a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multigenerational plan for living</a> in our house, so we aren’t concerned about short-term resale maximization,” says Peggy. “We wanted to stay true to the spirit and look of the classic brownstone style, but update the bathroom with a water-efficient toilet and fixtures.</span><span>”</span></p>
<h3>Achieving their dream bathroom aesthetic</h3>
<p><span class="s10_overlay-text"></span><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="bathtub-with-marble-wall-tiles" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-09.jpg" alt="bathtub with marble wall tiles and grab bar and patterened floor tiles and dark blue vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-51571 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span>“The idea was to have this renovation be fine for decades,” says Peggy. “We wanted something classic, electrical and plumbing up to code, and environmentally friendly but that would respect the aesthetic of our centenarian house.” Installing safety compliant features like easy tub access, grab bars, and non-slip flooring was also a priority. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="marble-wall-tiles-with-recessed-shelves" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="bathtub with marble wall tiles and recessed shelves and grab bar next to a window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-51563 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They originally planned to move the tub under the window, which had been done with their kids’ bathroom a few years ago.  “We like to take baths, and were motivated to expand floor space and have the window view when soaking,” said Peggy. “However, we realized that also meant we couldn’t have grab bars on a  window wall.” </span></p>
<p><span>Their Sweeten contractor referred them to a designer, who then consulted on the space’s layout. The designer suggested leaving the tub in place and moving the toilet to make more space for a larger vanity. Good advice!</span><span> The end result of the renovation is undeniable: “It’s clean, fresh, serene…and has no leaks!” The couple also used six inches of space behind the shower wall for building in double storage niches.</span></p>
<p><span><u>Bonus</u>: They repurposed their hallway mirror for their bathroom, since it had the vintage feel they wanted. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Brooklyn couple renovate a rental unit for a warm welcome</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Bellamy, an executive at The GAP, and Zak, a senior environmental scientist, took their 119-year old Bed-Stuy brownstone and turned it on its head by flipping the way it was previously used. The new configuration puts the couple at the top of the building in a cozy duplex with a single-story rental on the garden level. To achieve this, they carefully planned their renovation budget to be allocated between the two living spaces. (See how they transformed the two floors <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of their own home here</a>.) They came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, to update the bathroom, add sliding doors, and create a new entrance for a private, light-filled rental unit. </em></p>

</a>Guest post by Bed-Stuy homeowner Bellamy</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I owned a one-bedroom condo in Bedford-Stuyvesant, but when Zak and I moved in together we wanted a larger space for ourselves. So we moved out and rented for two years, which gave us the flexibility to take our time buying and not rush the search process. It worked in our favor since it took us almost eight months to find and purchase a home. We were specifically looking for a two-family house where we would be able to rent out a portion of the house to supplement the mortgage.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We found this perfect three-story brownstone in Bed-Stuy—2,400 square feet, about 800 per floor. It was built in 1899, and when we found it, there was a lower duplex and a top floor rental. We wanted to flip that scenario and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten. With help from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovated the top two floors</a> for ourselves and gave the rental a facelift.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33377 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental_Before0306-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Bellamy Grindl Townhouse-Rental_Before03+06" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" title="light-brown-barn-door" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33330 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-44-723x482.jpg" alt="light brown barn door and room with white and blue walls and vinyl floor after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-44-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-44-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-44-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-44-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-44.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33324" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-36-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Bellamy Grindl Townhouse-Rental-36" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were much tighter on our budget in the rental since we had spent the bulk of our money on our personal living space. The mantra was, “Make it simple, functional, and durable.” I wanted to add natural light and brighten the space and make sure there was complete privacy between our living space and the rental unit. A separate stairwell would have had to be created if the rental stayed on the third floor, and we&#8217;d lose a lot of existing footprint. By making our home on the top two floors and relocating the rental to the garden-level, we not only kept the square footage but it turned out to be the easiest and least expensive option.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first thing we did was close off access—which was a set of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French doors</a>—to the stairway going from the first floor and on up to our living space. This gave us an open area to create a coat closet when you walk into the rental unit. I loved that my contractor suggested pushing the coat closet as far back as we could which would otherwise have been wasted space inside the rental. Instead, the entire hallway now serves as storage space for Zak and I and a way to our basement that only we can access.</p>
<blockquote><p>We did spend the majority of our budget in our living space. But I am happy with the areas we chose to upgrade in the rental.</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Once our contractor realized that Zak and I were quite handy, we were able to figure out what we could do versus what we should leave to the professionals. Overall, it was all about repurposing what we had. I did a fun tie-dye paint effect over the bed. I’d read online about how to transform a large wall with little cost using a sample can of Behr interior acrylic eggshell paint; it cost about $3. I diluted the paint with water until it was the consistency I wanted and then crisscrossed it over the wall until it was the desired effect. Zak and I did the kitchen ourselves, painting the cabinets, tiling the backsplash, grouting, and putting in new countertops. We also installed the sliding barn doors. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bathroom</a> was left to the professionals!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33334 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental_Before02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Bellamy Grindl Townhouse-Rental_Before02" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33326" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-40-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Bellamy Grindl Townhouse-Rental-40" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In closing off the basement, we had to relocate the bathroom entrance and seal off a doorway in the kitchen. With the added wall space, we fit a small eat-in nook in the kitchen. The other thing that needed attention in the rental was an awful bathroom. We replaced everything in there. It completely changed the space and made it feel more modern and updated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the house was built in 1899, we thought we might find some interesting details, but, unfortunately, all the character was stripped prior to us buying the house. Everything had probably been replaced in the past 15 years. Because we were adding walls, it was hard to stay consistent with the original molding, so to stay on budget, we opted for the least expensive four-inch <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">base molding</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was absolutely worth renovating. We did spend the majority of our budget in our own living space, but I am happy with the areas we chose to upgrade in the rental. The new flow gives us both privacy, we all gained extra storage space, and we&#8217;ve received great feedback on what we&#8217;ve put together.</p>

<p>For us, a fixer-upper was a must.</p>
<p>There was the professional itch; as an interior designer for an architecture firm specializing in Brooklyn brownstones, I had house-envy. I had a Pinterest board called &#8220;Someday house ideas&#8221; slowly filling with the most affordable versions of all my favorite finishes. It has 600 pins.</p>
<p>And then there was practicality; although we loved our huge and quirky one-bedroom in Boerum Hill, it had no way to create a second bedroom and no access to the sleeping area except a dizzying spiral staircase. Time to move on.</p>
<p>In our (VERY) stressful house hunt, we were the runner-up offer on four houses before The One. It was an unusually wide two-family brick Tudor townhouse in Kensington, around the corner from my husband’s elementary school. The block is tiny and quiet, across from a beautiful gatehouse of Greenwood Cemetery. There is a bountiful apricot tree in the front yard and a huge grapevine in the back. There was even—the Brooklyn equivalent of a tennis court or horse stables—a driveway.  But the best part was the friendly atmosphere. Many of our neighbors have lived their entire lives on this block, and we were thrilled to join them.</p>
<p>It was a major job, though. The home had only one owner since it was built in 1941, and it had been decades since the home had been well-maintained. Everything practical had to go: plumbing, gorgeous-but-ruined steel windows, cloth-wrapped aluminum electrical wiring that the home inspector begged us to replace &#8220;so I can sleep at night. Really. Please. PLEASE.&#8221;</p>
<p>The structure was great, however, and it was full of personality and charm. I adored the arched doorways and beautiful 1950s Caloric stove, and I wanted to maintain &#8217;40s details even where everything would be new. I collected bright and cheerful images of tiled bathrooms, Airstream-inspired kitchens, and patterned floors. I prepared a full set of construction drawings, selected all my finishes, and looked for a contractor.</p>
<p>I know some general contractors that my office uses, but I wanted to keep my personal renovation separate to avoid conflicts of interest. I was thrilled to find Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a>, and then selected a contractor from a list of really excellent matches. I got pregnant, and the clock began to tick as we ran into a contract delay with the team we’d chosen. I was paralyzed with stress, back at square one with a due date and a house full of lead paint and death-wiring, holed up in the basement with my belongings around my ears like a hoarder. There was some crying. But I called Sweeten, and they swooped into action. Within 48 hours, they had amicably resolved the issue and found me three new excellent contractors to interview, all of whom could start immediately. Our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> was particularly impressive, calling me with thoughtful questions about my drawing set and offering ideas for cost-savings. I could not believe how fast the Sweeten team saved the day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our house was originally a two-bedroom apartment on the top floor, with a duplex on the first floor and garden level. But at some point, the garden level had been finished as an apartment in its own right, and we preferred to have our duplex upstairs with rentable space on the bottom. By eliminating the need for a separate entrance to the second floor, we were able to open up the center staircase to the living room and turn the entry from a dark, tiny box into an open alcove, flooding the front of the house with light. The difference has been amazing.</p>
<p>We also took advantage of a neat arched niche that sat between two closets in the bedroom on the first floor. The back wall of this niche was up against the kitchen, and by punching through, we created a doorway from the kitchen into what is now the dining room. Suddenly there was a clear view all the way through the house, without removing the lovely original details.</p>

<p>The kitchen was designed around the amazing old stove and a salvaged Sub-Zero fridge that I found for a song at Build It Green in Gowanus. The front panel was a dark glossy charcoal, which was already what I had been thinking about for my lower cabinets. It was fate. I did the uppers in matte white, with a pretty hand-made subway tile that has an uneven surface that reflects light softly. I like to have my cooking ingredients out all the time, so I had the cabinets installed unusually high to fit a shelf for jars underneath. The counters are a honed Jet Mist granite, which gave me the look of soapstone without any of its typical green tint, which would have clashed with my Sub-Zero.</p>
<p>I snagged a vintage enamel sink from BIG, and paired it with the restaurant-style sprayer faucet of my dreams from Signature Hardware. It lives up to the hype. Our most unusual score was the island, which I happened upon one night as I drove down the block on my way home from work. It’s an amazing furniture piece that a neighbor was throwing away, exactly the perfect dimension for our kitchen. Although I planned to replace the top with butcher block, I have so loved the wavy green tiles that I’ve kept it just as I found it.</p>

<p>Our other first-floor change was to shrink the original full bath down to a powder room, using the space that housed the tub as a walk-in pantry off the kitchen. The original baths were all an intense pink with raspberry accents &#8211; pink walls, pink floor, pink toilet, pink tub. Every pink its very own shade! The coolest discovery came in peeling off the wild pink floral wallpaper; directly on the original walls, we found delicate hand-painted Chinoiserie scenes of a river, swans, and boats. A neighbor told us that all the houses had them, but that slowly over the years they’ve been lost. Sadly, it was badly damaged, so we only have photos.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new powder room is wonderful, though, and a better use for our space. I used a salvaged pedestal sink and a window from Olde Good Things for a high transom, so the room isn’t entirely cut off from its original window. And at long last, we found a home for the Brooklyn Toile wallpaper from Flavor Paper (made just one block away from our old apartment!), which was designed by Mike D from the Beastie Boys. My husband spent years longing for this paper, which features a dreamy mix of Notorious B.I.G. and angelic Nathan’s hot dogs and men in fur hats and Park Slope stroller mommies. I picked a cement floor tile of navy and gray plaid, had the paper custom-matched to it, and then papered the hall just outside it with my favorite Schumacher print of completely nuts-o Tibetan tigers. Because my clients never let me have that much fun.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The other layout updates were upstairs, where we turned a kitchen into the master bathroom and closet of my dreams. The new shower is about the size of the studio I lived in during grad school. The tiles in there were my biggest splurge, with a pretty &#8217;40s-inspired white and blue marble floor and cornflower blue walls with period-appropriate black tile trim. In fact, I used a thread of either blue or orange throughout the whole house, which helped tie together my otherwise colorful selections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upstairs had the same arched niche which we again punched through for flow, and stole some closet space to create a linen closet in the hall. We repurposed original doors, which have amazing Deco knobs and backplates. The original bath’s odd standing shower became a washer-dryer unit.</p>

<p>Our son’s bathroom, beyond losing its shower to the washer-dryer, kept its layout with cosmetic updates only. I found a cornflower blue penny round for the floor, with family-friendly gray grout that hides the dirt, and paired it with white subway tile and a cobalt blue bullnose tile. The black vanity is made to look like a repurposed dresser, but it is actually a sneaky Restoration Hardware reproduction that matches the one in the master bath. My favorite touch is the shower, with its pretty vintage-style handheld showerhead and its huge oversized rain head.</p>

<p>Our son&#8217;s nursery was the room I was most itching to decorate as the renovation finished. The dresser is vintage, and I made blinds by cannibalizing a Home Depot shade with a Spoonflower fabric of wonderful tigers, to whom we now bid goodnight in our bedtime routine. The mobile was a gift from his grandmother, from an artist she knows in Brooklyn whose Etsy shop (AllySen) sells similar creations. Lucy Goosey, the giant plastic goose nightlight, is a particular favorite and another gift from family. We tried to scatter family throughout the room, from photos and cards to the quilt hanging above the crib, made for my husband when he was born. I was a very happy camper when that room was finished before our son, Mac, arrived!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As for other original details, we tried to reuse a few light fixtures, but only one held up to re-wiring. The rest were mostly purchased from Schoolhouse Electric and Y Lighting. The floors were refinished with a wonderful no-VOC satin-finish natural oil product called Rubio Monocoat, which everyone loves when they visit. And my contractor and the crew thought I was crazy to replicate the original black windows with their traditional mullions, but they fit the Tudor style of the house perfectly, and I was adamant. Luckily, the guys all changed their minds when they were installed and stained. Or they were polite enough to pretend.</p>
<p>Throughout the project—completed on-budget and on-time, a minor miracle—I was so happy to see the crew every morning. I do NOT recommend living in the basement during a renovation unless you know exactly what you’re getting into, but it was our only option, and the crew was wonderful. It also made meetings a breeze, as I would pop upstairs on my way to work, discussing any questions that had arisen the day before. The crew&#8217;s foreman was reliable in every way, particularly for solving problems intelligently and with an eye for design. He is worth his weight in gold.</p>
<p>In the end, we made our deadline, but more importantly, we made the home I had hoped for. I used to stand in the half-framed kitchen, imagining our little boy padding around the loop made by our newly-opened doorways. Sure enough, every night Mac does his laps, chasing the cats and toppling over onto floors that the team patched and sanded and made to look like they have always been this way. We love our old stove, although the left burners have to be lit with a match. We love our neighbors, and the stories they tell of all the families who have come through over the years. We made this old home new again, and for that, I am deeply grateful to Sweeten and our Sweeten contractor and all the rest.</p>

<p>We continue to putter with smaller projects: painting the garage door, glamming up the entry with our practical and beautiful Shoe-seum (I am slowly being edged out by my husband’s sneakers). Perhaps if we ever manage to tackle the backyard, we will have another Sweeten post for the scary concrete underground wine cellar that turns everything into mildew. But for now, we are enjoying our small projects after the big project was handled by the pros.</p>
