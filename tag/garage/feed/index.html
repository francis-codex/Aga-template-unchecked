But it was nice to know that Sweeten</span><span class="s1"> was there if we needed them.

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">An old Los Angeles garage finds new use</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’d been living in <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our house</a> for about three years when we started the garage remodel. The home, built in 1936 and located in Inglewood, a suburb of Los Angeles, is a bungalow-style cottage. The most recent appraisal said it comprised 690 square feet; the unattached <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage added an additional 260</a> square feet of “unofficial” usable space. In a house this small, you can’t afford to take a single square foot for granted. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My partner, Tom, and I both work in research administration at the University of California at Los Angeles; I recently completed a certificate for interior design and am in the midst of changing careers. We knew we could benefit from a secondary live-work area. We realized the garage could be it, and that transforming the space could be a rewarding project.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Hiring a general contractor with Sweeten</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Knowing we would renovate the garage, we’d agreed it would have to be phase two. We made the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first round of renovations</a> out of sheer necessity after buying the house with a long list of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structural and systemic issues</a>. The experience of trying to line up dependable contractors had been stressful—even getting quotes. We’d hired the one contractor we could pin down. It was that experience that prompted us to <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with Sweeten</a> this time around.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-14.jpg" alt="Natural toned garage living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52339" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg" alt="Garage work space and orange leather couch" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52349" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We renovated the garage when we did because we planned to sell the house. But working from home during Covid made us realize that room to spread out would benefit us while we still lived there. We posted our project and waited to see <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which contractors were interested</a> in taking on a garage remodel in Los Angeles.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Inspecting the garage&#8217;s structure</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The job wouldn’t be easy. We needed to solve the garage’s long-standing structural issues. The building was more than 80 years old; the roof had begun to sag and we were unsure of the extent of the damage. Perhaps the job would involve replacing the ceiling’s support beams and installing a new door. Or it might require an entire rebuild. We needed someone to inspect the structure and advise us of what was needed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luckily, that wasn’t as difficult as we anticipated. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor we chose determined that the original beams had been too narrow, and spaced too far apart, to fully support the garage’s ceiling. He also informed us that the two existing single-car garage doors were rotting away and termite-ridden. Our biggest question was, “Do we have enough money” to fix the problems? Turned out the answer was yes, and then some!</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Creating a new living/working space in the garage</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We had several goals beyond shoring up the garage. First, we wanted to replace the existing two one-car garage doors with a fully automated two-car door. Second, we needed to install a new outlet for plugging in our electric car charger. Finally, we sought to create a space that would be more than a storage area—as comfortable as our living room, but (because local building codes required it) still functional as a garage. No layout changes would be necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We decided to give the space the look of a loft. We envisioned exposed wood beams lining the ceilings, crisp white walls, and a lot of natural light. In keeping with that aesthetic, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used a lot of the existing materials</a>, including the wood ceiling beams (they are the actual structural supports that already existed with some additional wood reinforcing them) and the original concrete slab floor (we filled in cracks with a special cement caulk and painted it gray).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">The walls looked so smooth for a dwelling built in 1936, that has been flexing and shifting with every earthquake for the last 80 years.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Custom doors for a small space</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One big challenge was the garage door. We have discovered that with a small house comes the joy of everything being undersized and therefore not standard. Doors and windows had needed customization, and the garage door was no different—it was narrower than the norm. In addition, we discovered that the garage floor sloped, necessitating a custom panel on the bottom of the door that sloped side-to-side with the floor, ensuring a weatherproof seal. The panel, though surprisingly expensive, has been worth it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walls offered no straight lines, either, but our drywall installer was a true artist. The walls looked so smooth for a dwelling built in 1936, that has been flexing and shifting with every earthquake for the last 80 years. There wasn’t a single straight, vertical wall, and some bowed or curved. The cabinets</span><span class="s9"> </span><span class="s1">provided a good deal of storage and brought a domestic air to what might otherwise just feel like a garage. The countertop is an unfinished pine board and is, like the ceiling, a little rustic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-04.jpg" alt="natural toned garage living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52350" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1.jpg" alt="Blue garage with closed door" width="1000" height="618" class="alignnone wp-image-52359 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1-300x185.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1-600x371.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">The right contractor for a garage remodel in Los Angeles</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor had a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clear communication style</a> and was immensely helpful throughout the process. We could always count on him to respond promptly when we sent him a text or email. More often than not he’d call us back to talk via phone, which I appreciated. He kept us informed of when the subcontractors were going to be working and who specifically would be at our house. And best of all, he stayed on budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our contractor was so good that we didn’t need Sweeten&#8217;s support too much. But it was nice to know that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten was there</a></span><span class="s1"> if we needed them. It was like knowing you have an insurance policy in case of problems; you hope to never use it, but it gives you peace of mind knowing it’s there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The space in our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new garage</a> feels generous and comfortable, and the light inside is beautiful throughout the day because of all the windows. The built-in cabinets are attractive (the black pulls provide a nice contrast to the white and wood surfaces in the room) and also bring a ton of much-needed storage. Even though the garage is now a living space, we also needed to make sure there were attractive places to store things.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Samantha</span></i></span></p>
<h3>Recreating an under-used garage</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running their creative agency, VERSUS, in New York City takes up a lot of their time during the day. So Samantha Louise Barnes and her husband, Justin, like to </span>relax at their weekend home in Fairfield County. It&#8217;s located in Weston, which is a quaint small town with tree-lined streets, good schools, and notable architecture. The town is known for its mid-century modern architecture and their home is no exception. It was built in 1948 by architect Lloyd Flood, who was an early associate of architect Edward Durell Stone.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>The couple shares the home, which was previously renovated, with their two-year-old rescue cat, Louise. Set on a dead-end street, Samantha wanted to make the most of her 1,750-square-foot home. That meant converting the garage. They rarely use the second bay. Samantha and Justin take their car to the train station every week and leave it parked there until the weekend. So what to do with this underutilized space? Create that ceramic studio Samantha had always dreamed about, of course.</p>
<h3>In search of a contractor</h3>
<p>Samantha wanted to get the renovation done quickly—preferably in a month’s time. So she started researching, pricing, and locating the equipment needed for the soon-to-be ceramic studio. It was challenging but she found a kiln in South Carolina. Apparently, a lot of people had the same idea to create a ceramic studio during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Once this was taken care of, she set her sights on hiring the right contractor for the job. She posted the project on Sweeten to find a general contractor. “[Sweeten] offered advice every step of the way,” said Samantha. “I felt confident that I would be happy with who they vetted.” Samantha and Justin hired a Sweeten contractor and the project began.</p>

<h3>Figuring out the layout</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea was to choose the shorter bay—made smaller by a closet located in the back—and converting it into the studio. Twenty-five percent of the closet would make space for the kiln while the other 75 percent remained as a closet accessible via the other garage bay.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But Samantha also worried about getting the electric requirements correct. So, she worked closely with her Sweeten contractor and his electrician to ensure that the kiln would run safely. They gave the kiln its own outlet and dedicated breaker box.</span></p>
<h3>A ceramic studio comes to life</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of the renovation is a beautiful, artistic space. They kept the back window to allow light to shine through behind the kiln. And added another window above the air conditioner to give a bright airiness to the space. Their contractor also assisted with picking out the double French doors that replaced the original garage door. And figured out the right air conditioner/heating unit to match the electricity needs.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Having my own space separate from the house is wonderful,” said Samantha. “It’s additional creative space we just love having access to.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Connecting with the main house</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the aesthetics, Samantha and Justin chose to keep some consistency with the main house’s design. For example, the flooring in the main house is a poured concrete so they went with that in the ceramic studio. The concrete fits in nicely with the artistic vibe of the space. Plus, it’s safe to use under the kiln and Samantha likes the “rough” look. The trim is the same as in the main house as well. Material choices and style were to keep a cohesive look and feel. </span></p>

<h3>Finding their general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Samantha and Justin first started thinking about renovating, they knew it wasn&#8217;t going to be a big job. However, they did want to find a trustworthy, qualified contractor. &#8220;We are only at our home on the weekends, so we still consider ourselves new to the area and needed a jumping-off place to find someone,&#8221; said Samantha. &#8220;Instead of running through a slew of contractors on the Internet, I thought of Sweeten.&#8221; The result met all the couple&#8217;s expectations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having my own space separate from the house is wonderful,” said Samantha. “It’s additional creative space we just love having access to.”</span></p>

			<h2 class="p1">From efficient ADUs to spa-like bathrooms, home interior design in Los Angeles points to simplicity, utility, and going traditional</h2>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46811 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg" alt="bedroom remodel for actress Jaime Ray Newman los angeles" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">Diversity is king when it comes to home interior design in Los Angeles. The city has a sense of history, with styles spanning Spanish Colonial to Mission Revival, Beaux-Arts to Art Deco, Hollywood Regency to streamline 1930s modern. The desire to preserve those design styles is strong, as is the need to make homes liveable for today. H<span>ome renovation design trends in Los Angeles</span> and what rooms and features are important have shifted nationwide. Fortunately, for LA contractors and designers, remodeling has not missed a beat.</p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Top photo</em>) Sweeten renovators and actor Jaime Ray Newman and Guy Nattiv&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles home renovation</a></span></p>
<h3>Changes and challenges: Home interior design in Los Angeles</h3>
<p class="p2">“We didn’t really see much of a change,” said Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5968#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA general contractor Trevor</a>. “It&#8217;s just a redirect.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The challenge is more about materials shortages, delays, and rising costs</span><span class="s2">.</span> “The cost of lumber is affecting building,” said Trevor. Sheet plywood, for example, has jumped from $18 to around $50, he said. “People are asking for alternatives to lumber, like tin framing used in commercial.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">A renewed focus on outdoor living</h3>
<p class="p2">“A lot more people are fixing their exterior,” said Trevor. “People want to spend money on outdoor hardscapes, swimming pools. In LA, that’s where you spend 60 percent of your time.”</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.cozystylishchic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA-based designer Jeanne Chung</a> agreed. “It’s all about indoor-outdoor living,” she said. NanaWalls, which fold in and extend the indoor space out to patios, are very popular. “They double the square footage of eating and entertaining areas,” said Jeanne.</p>
<p class="p2">The bonus of adding windows, especially large ones to foster the indoor/outdoor connection is gaining more natural light.</p>
<p class="p2">Homeowners are also investing in <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor rooms</a>. Pools, water features, outdoor kitchens, firepits, and extensive seating and dining areas are high on wish lists. Materials are more organic, “definitely going back to nature.” Trevor is using a lot of textured cement, stamped, and honed finishes. “A salt finish really is big. With mid-century design, there’s a lot of tile work. We do ipe wood outdoors and a type of red hardwood that is slightly less hard than ipe, but about half the price.”</p>
<h3 class="p5">ADUs and additions for more square footage</h3>
<p class="p2">One rising trend for home interior design in Los Angeles is remodeling ADUs (accessory dwelling units). “It’s generating the <span style="color: #333333;">biggest buzz,” said <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor Trevor. </span>These detached structures, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often garages</a>, are repurposed as guest houses, rentals, or home offices.</p>
<p class="p2">Many of her clients are adding to the existing footprint. “They’re knocking out walls to create a little extra space, as in bathrooms, for example.”</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg" alt="Modern living room with glass walls and modern gray fireplace" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirsty and David&#8217;s</a> Mid-City/Miracle Mile home in LA</span></p>
<p class="p2">“You can build a second story,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “It’s contingent on the footprint of the existing structure. A lot are pushed outside of the setback, so they go high vertically. People are going for the max. It’s getting a lot of value on the price for square foot.” If you&#8217;re planning on expanding or remodeling a kitchen or bathroom (more on them below), look for a vetted general contractor that is licensed. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor in LA</a> with experience will guide you through the process.</p>
<h3>Keeping kitchens fresh and updated</h3>
<p class="p6">“It’s where you get the most <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bang for the buck</a>,” said Trevor. The remodel here may happen more frequently than in other parts of the country. Apparently, design fatigue sets in earlier. He has <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to kitchens</a> remodeled just two years before for a refresh. “It’s like changing wardrobes.”</p>
<p class="p2">LA kitchens tend to be large, mostly open plan, and gourmet with top-of-the-line professional appliances. But there’s not as much carving, ornate moldings, over-the-top use of stones. Instead, there’s more of a creative mix of materials. At the same time, the goal is more making it your own with custom looks—tile backsplashes, bold color ranges, and stove hoods.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="geometric-pattern-black-white-backsplash-tiles" class="alignnone wp-image-50846 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass.jpg" alt="peninsula island in kitchen with white marble countertop and undermount sink with gold faucet and fixtures and pendant lights and black kitchen cabinets and geometric pattern black white backsplash tiles and vent over cooking range after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h4>Top kitchen materials to watch</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Cabinets. Simple clean-lined styles are flat-panel and frameless. Hardware is modern, sculptural, or jewelry-like. Otherwise, there are hidden touch latches. Wood is finding competition in painted finishes, mostly in soothing livable shades.</li>
<li class="p2">Island culture. Some islands are getting bigger, some are multi-level for different functions. Waterfall sides on islands are popular.</li>
<li class="p2">Appliances. Pro-style ranges favor stylish brands like cooktops and ovens from Wolf, Monogram by GE, LaCornue, and Lacanche. The desire to cook healthy promotes features like special burners for woks, steam cooking. Some ranges even have an integrated sous vide. The slow cooking in a vacuum-sealed bag retains more nutrients, uses less oil, fat, and salt.</li>
<li class="p2">Porcelain and quartz are gaining in popularity because of the similar looks to stone without the maintenance. Large slabs and large format tiles offer a seamless installation with no grout lines to break up the design. Matte finishes have overtaken shiny ones.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">“Here in LA, my clients don’t want polished,” said Jeanne. “I am using concrete-looking porcelain slabs and cement tiles.” Jeanne seals her concrete to guard against staining because it’s pretty porous.</p>
<h4>Finishes lead the way</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Color is taking a turn. Moody, dark colors—black, deep blues, and bottle greens—are ramping up, said Sweeten contractor Trevor. They pair well with burnished or brushed gold. “I do a lot of antiqued blue—like a muted denim—with brass pulls,” he said.</li>
<li class="p2">Lighter woods seem to suit the lighter mood of interiors. That goes for cabinets as well as flooring. Wide plank wood floors are on trend—with an average of 7&#8243;—and in French oak whitewashed finishes, cappuccino, some with a hint of gray.</li>
<li class="p2">Gold touch. LA homeowners are opting more for burnished and brushed gold finishes in cabinet hardware, faucets, and lighting. Some appliance manufacturers now include brass pulls as options. But mixing gold, especially with black matte, is very chic. Mixing metals adds interest to the design, especially in kitchens, where there is a lot of cabinetry.</li>

<h3 class="p2">The spa bath is redefined</h3>
<p class="p2">In Los Angeles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgrading the whole bathroom</a> means incorporating a level of comfort. Freestanding tubs provide a visual <i>tour de force</i>. Most often they are made of stone, porcelain, quartz, or resin, so the shape lends a sculptural note. Large curbless walk-in showers are distinguished with surface materials. Linear drains are trending because they are more aesthetically pleasing. Rain showers are favored, but you won’t find multiple showerheads due to water restrictions. Floors often are radiant heated.</p>

<p class="p2">The divide—choosing between tub and shower—is more about personal preferences. Many see the sculptural artistry of the tub as adding to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return on investment</a>. Radiant heat is also a value-added. An alternative to slab stone walls is large-format porcelain tile. These tiles, with a range of looks that mimic various stones, come in similar slab formats.</p>
<p class="p2">More than ever, the bath is <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered an oasis</a>. The overall style may be elegant, but again, the overall look is simplified, with cleaner, more modern lines.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Ensuite bedrooms are preferred to mega-size closets</h3>
<p class="p2">Jeanne said her clients would rather have larger bedrooms with sitting areas than supersized closets. Still, walk-in closets are on remodeling wish lists.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Storage is key</h3>
<p class="p2">Unseen compartments in drawers or cubbies in cabinetry and built-in benches corral stuff to keep spaces visually clean.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49429 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg" alt="Modern kitchen with exposed beams and stacked washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"></span></p>

<h3 class="p2">Mudrooms are still going strong</h3>
<p class="p2">Although some trend forecasters suggest the demise of these transitional spaces for hanging coats and dropping gear, Jeanne said not so in LA. “Especially with the pandemic,” she said, “There’s a desire for bigger mudrooms. It’s like a decontamination area—coming into the home, taking off all your grimy stuff.” Typical layouts include hanging storage behind doors, cubbies, and benches for putting on shoes or boots. Some incorporate pet stations.</p>
<h3 class="p2">There’s an uptick in requests for libraries</h3>
<p class="p2">“It’s a very popular room right now,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “It’s only going to get more popular. I’ve had three customers recently tell me they want libraries—real traditional, with everything built in.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">Home offices are making a comeback</h3>
<p class="p2">The Zoom fatigue is real, but so is the realization that the backdrop for those visual calls needs to step up. Jeanne recently had a request from a wife to make her husband’s office more fashionable—because of his frequent video calls.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Ongoing remodeling trends consistent in LA</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li class="p2">Going green and sustainability is much more in demand with a more conscious effort to utilize eco-friendly materials as well as those that save energy.</li>
<li class="p2">Smart home. Automation adjusts to temperature, lighting, and security. Smart devices even monitor cooking.</li>
<li class="p2">A few things to consider when remodeling in LA: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seismic codes</a> that require tall stem walls, slab on grade with thick foundations in order to guard against earthquake damage. Also, water restriction dictates the kinds of showers allowed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="p2">Classic and traditional design emerges</h3>
<p>For home interior design in Los Angeles, Trevor also said that there appears to be a return to more traditional design.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p2">“Mid-century modern has always been huge like ranch home designs,” he said. &#8220;But traditional design is coming back—I would call it a mix between mid-century, Dutch, and American traditional. Recently I’ve been seeing yellow and some of the 70s colors coming back.”</li>
<li class="p2">Statement decorating is hot. It’s part of the remodel plan. It could be a feature wall, a painted mural, or wallcovering. It could be a pop of color in a professional range or a graphic patterned tile on a backsplash. Outdoors, it might be a pergola, water, or fire feature.</li>
<li class="p2">There’s an appreciation for artisanal looks. Handmade tiles, handcrafted hardware lend personality to interiors. Some renovation inspiration comes from restaurant and hotel design.</li>
<li class="p2">“Simplicity—we’re definitely going in that direction,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “Not so much baroque-style with lots of moldings. People are going functional. They want hip and stylish.” There’s a minimalist sensibility, but not in the spare extreme.</li>
<li class="p2">California style—with a modern or rustic refined look—still is strong, with lighter bleached look woods and ceiling beams.</li>

<h2 class="p1">Key factors to convert a garage into living space: costs, climate control, property value &amp; local zoning</h2>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49341" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Door-11.5.jpg" alt="Garage renovation" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Door-11.5.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Door-11.5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Door-11.5-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/featured-slider/a-hamptons-bays-beach-house-renovation-gets-a-pop-art-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katy&#8217;s garage conversion</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">into an indoor-outdoor room</span></p>
<p>Increasingly, garages in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are morphing into multi-use spaces. To homeowners, these garage spaces are blank canvases and are morphing into anything from self-contained units to home offices. If you&#8217;re wondering how to convert your garage into a living space, there are some details you&#8217;ll need to gather first.</p>
<p>At Sweeten, we’re here to help you flip that underutilized garage into one of the best rooms in the house or perhaps an income-generating unit. Before you take on turning a garage into living space, like a home gym or guest house, there are things to consider. Does the space have proper insulation?</p>
<p>Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</p>
<h3>Garage remodel ideas</h3>
<p>Anything. Really! Garages have been converted into gyms, personal getaway space, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-contained studio apartments</a>, and home bars, according to Sweeten general contractor Michael. “It’s found space, so get creative,” Michael said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-06.jpg" alt="one part of two car detached garage converted to room and sectional door replaced with see through glass doors during renovation" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone wp-image-50920 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) With Sweeten&#8217;s help, a 150-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-connecticut-garage-renovation-creates-an-art-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage remodel</a> in Connecticut became a ceramics studio</span></p>
<h3>Should you trade in car storage space for a garage remodel?</h3>
<p class="p3">While some people are giving up their car’s indoor space altogether, others are slicing their garage in half, said Michael. This leaves room for at least one car, and the rest of the space becomes something else. “That way you can still have a garage when you sell your house,” he said.</p>
<p class="p3">Michael believes the jury is still out on if the property value increases whether the garage is converted or not. Some Sweeten contractors believe a garage is much more valuable as a living space for the homeowner and for resale purposes. <a href="https://budgeting.thenest.com/making-room-garage-affect-home-value-31778.html"><span class="s2">Reports indicate that a home&#8217;s</span></a> value could increase by as much as six percent, but that’s only if the area has ample street parking. Taking away your garage and off-street parking in a high-density area could bring that value down.</p>
<p class="p3">However, some towns might require at least one car space on your property and potentially two in some areas, Michael said. This could mean slotting your car into an outdoor area somewhere else in your front yard. “Do your homework,” Michael said. More on zoning and permits below.</p>
<h3>How much does it cost to convert a garage into living space?</h3>
<p class="p3">Budgets for a garage renovation can vary greatly depending on many factors including the state of your garage, your intended use, and the types of materials you want to use. To get an accurate read on your budgets, it’s always best to sit down with a general contractor who can tailor a quote for your situation.</p>
<p class="p3">Converting a garage is a good-value strategy to add living space to your home, costing <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/money/real-estate/2017/02/10/renovating-garage-less-costly-option-than-addition/97742930/"><span class="s2">$30 a square foot</span></a> which is less than an extension, according to NorthJersey.com. Sweeten contractor Michael puts the average range of a garage conversion in the tri-state area between $35,000 and $60,000. “But I’ve seen upwards of $100,000,” he said.</p>
<p class="p3">The fit-out for a garage conversion shouldn’t cost more than $45,000 to make the space comfortable, Michael said. That includes plumbing for a toilet, insulation, and heating. However, “A lot of people are putting in bars and fridges, some cooking equipment, or cool decorative wall paneling,” he said. These are just a few examples of what can bump up the price tag.</p>
<p class="p3">A basic garage conversion project that another Sweeten contractor has worked on came in at $25,000. The homeowner wanted an art studio. To handle the new 25 lighting fixtures—art studios need a lot of light—the space required an electrical upgrade including a new breaker box. Insulation was also required so it was comfortable during the fall, spring, and summer. A heater was added for the winter.</p>
<p class="p3">For a $60,000 project in rural New Jersey, a homeowner wanted to add a fully self-contained apartment to the second story of their garage. That meant adding a kitchen and bathroom, which pushes up a budget substantially. Plumbing, electrical, an interior and exterior overhaul as well as reinforcing the exterior stairs were part of the remodel.</p>
<p class="p3">The budget might seem big, but it was an income-generating investment bringing in rental income at $1,400 a month.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg" alt="Garage remodel in los angeles with sofa and office" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52349 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>What are the conditions of the garage?</h3>
<p class="p3">Sometimes, you&#8217;ll need to clear those spaces out from junk and any animal tenants. Many underutilized garages, especially standalone structures, may have experienced neglect for a period of time.</p>
<p class="p3">Whether a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/derelict-garage-finds-purpose-she-shed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stand-alone garage is structurally sound</a> will also be a question. This will take on additional importance if you’re renovating or adding a second story.</p>
<p class="p3">Garages can also have random and awkwardly placed columns disrupting the open space, or a ceiling height that isn’t conducive to taller guests. And most floors will be on a pitch so water can run right off it, according to Michael. These are the types of problems that might require a creative solution if you’re going to convert your garage into a living space.</p>
<h3>Consider: Insulation and heating a garage remodel</h3>
<p class="p3">Most garages lack insulation. Consequently, it probably won&#8217;t have heating; so consider what you want to use the space for. If it will be used just for the summer, adding some fans can offer a budget-conscious idea.</p>
<p class="p3">If you’re intending to use it all or most of the year, you will likely need to add insulation and heating in your garage conversion. Typically, garages are made of concrete blocks, so they tend to be very cold. However, a garage that is within your home might have some insulation on any wall or part of the ceiling that connects to the main house.</p>
<p class="p3">Giving the room its own heat source will cost up to $6,000. Keep in mind that a heat pump might require an electrical upgrade. “You can take an existing heat system in the house and blow it into the garage,” said Michael, of one possible solution.</p>
<p class="p3">The floor of a garage is typically concrete and a big source of heat loss. Adding insulation might be necessary. If that’s the case, you will need to dig down or elevate the floor if your ceiling height allows for that, Michael said.</p>
<h3>Zoning and permits needed to convert a garage into living space</h3>
<p class="p3">Unfortunately, zoning rules can get in the way of a garage conversion. This is because changing the use of your garage can be a big deal for some building departments. “Some zoning codes prohibit adding a loft or a second story,” said Michael. The best way forward is to talk with your general contractor to find out what rules your local area might have.</p>
<p class="p3">According to Sweeten contractors, the cost of permits will also change from area to area with a range from a few hundred dollars up to <span class="s2">$1,500</span> if you need permits for electrical, plumbing, and HVAC.</p>
<p class="p3">“Home Owners Associations often frown on these conversions,” Michael added. That’s because you will be taking away a car (or two) which might have been a vital part of that development’s original approval he said. If your home comes under an HOA, make sure to check their rules! It&#8217;s also wise to check the zoning and permitting restrictions in your area.</p>
<h3>Questions to ask when turning a garage into a living space</h3>
<p class="p3">Ultimately, homeowners interested in turning a garage into a living space should do some soul searching first. How much will it improve your quality of life? Will you rent it? How will it impact your property’s value? For many, a garage is worth more as a living space than it is as car storage. <span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your garage or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</span></p>

<h3>A house flood sets off a new start</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Sometimes you can spin a disaster into an opportunity. That’s what happened with Hildreth Place, our house in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-hamptons-edition/">the Hamptons</a>. We used a devastating flood as a prompt to create a happy, modern home where family and friends can meet. </span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hildreth Place has been in the Garry family for more than 40 years, and my husband and I have owned it for 10. The house is in Hampton Bays, New York, 50 yards from Meschutt Beach, where families gather to swim in the bay and live music plays every night at Tiki Joes. The house was originally built in 1970, in a traditional Cape style. We have long used it with family, shared it with friends, and <a href="https://katygarry.com/pages/hildreth-place-landing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also rented it</a>.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Two years ago, all of a sudden, a pipe froze and burst. After discovering eight feet of water in our basement, we decided to go down to the bones and renovate. Our goals were to make the home more efficient from both energy and maintenance standpoints, all while turning it into something beautiful that our family and friends can enjoy.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">A new chapter for a family home</span></h3>
<p>Cara Boyce of <a href="http://www.redwagondesignny.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Wagon Design</a> partnered with me on the interior design and helped me reimagine the home. <span class="s1">We planned to revise the façade, giving it the relaxed appearance of a modern farmhouse, and meanwhile use the interior redesign to solve problems and increase our living space. With Sweeten’s help, we found the perfect contractor to help us with our Hampton Bays home renovation. Accordingly, he worked on time and within budget, keeping cost savings in mind and brainstorming solutions to construction challenges. This house had a few!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Door-14.gif" alt="garage renovation as living space" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49060" /></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Hildreth Place has endured quite a bit, and we needed to prepare it for the future. The house has been standing 50 years, and is close to the beach and exposed to the elements. Consequently, our biggest investment was on exterior improvements. The materials needed to withstand the environment. For instance, we installed James Hardie <a href="https://www.thisoldhouse.com/siding/21072512/all-about-siding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clapboard on the exterior</a>, invested in a fiberglass front door, and chose fiberglass casement windows rather than old-school wood. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">A garage renovation turns into a lounge space </span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">One of the biggest interior changes we made in modernizing was on the home’s ground floor. The first floor was very traditional for a beach house, and the formal dining room, which was in the front of the house, wasn’t practical for entertaining.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">By raising the roofline, we were able to add about 200 square feet upstairs, creating space for a center hallway.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49055" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Bar-6.jpg" alt="gallery wall" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Bar-6.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Bar-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Bar-6-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p class="p1">We decided to create an open floor plan that connected the kitchen to a walk-through dining room. It continued out to our attached garage. With the garage renovation, we stole just under 300 square feet to create a new inside-outside room. As a result, this “garage room,” which opens to the back via an industrial-style roller door, lets the indoor space flow to the outdoors, and is an ideal casual gathering spot for coming off the beach.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">On the second floor, there was another flow blockage to overcome: We had four bedrooms, including a big dormer for the kids, but the only way to access that bunk room was through one of the other bedrooms. It was an awkward layout for children trying to find the bathroom at night. By raising the roofline, we were able to add about 200 square feet upstairs, creating space for a center hallway. As a result of the resectioning, we also found us space for a master bathroom, a nice bonus.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Personalizing with color and art</span></h3>
<p><span class="s1">Seeing my murals and paintings transform the house has been incredible. The master bedroom got a bold, black-and-white brush-stroke mural. I love it! I have a moody painting tucked between the shelves in the master bath and oceany pieces in all the first-floor rooms. A guest room with a bright bamboo theme features a hand-painted ceiling by me and is inspired by colors that I’ve been gravitating to—the combination of orange, hot pink, and red makes me happy.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Down on the first floor in the powder room, just off the garage, we added wallpaper—this Dorothy Draper look was a <i>dream</i> of mine. The undeniably lush green print and chartreuse ceiling color is the kind of pairing that inspires me as an artist. Such a surprise when you open the door! My recommendation is to always spend money on things that give the most bang for the buck. I told my husband that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the splurgy wallpaper</a> was more important than running water.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many of the room designs in the house are emphatically inspired by my paintings, as I really wanted to bring their joy into our home. One of the best examples of that is the “goldfish bathroom,” which is bathed in a dappling of water-blue penny tile and features several playful fish paintings. </span></p>

<h3 class="p3">Natural elements soften</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Correspondingly throughout the house, we also chose simple items to offset the highly visible ones.  We went with pre-painted cabinetry in the kitchen, and the same hardwood floors as in other rooms. The lights are modern loft pendants, clean in matte white.</span></p>

<h3>Deciding to renovate during COVID</h3>
<p>What do you do when a global pandemic hits in the middle of your home remodel—just as you’ve moved out of your house, with two babies under two years old in tow, to make way for the construction crew? Jaime Ray Newman washed her hands and pushed on.</p>

<p>“We were juggling a lot,” said the actor and producer, who had posted her project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> in 2019 for the dream redo of her 1936 ranch home. “We were expecting our second baby. It was now or never to blow open and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redo the house</a>.” The Sweeten post stated a desire to “convert our old 1930s two-car <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/adu-and-garage-renovations/a-los-angeles-garage-remodel-with-loft-like-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage to ADU</a>,” also known as an accessory dwelling unit, (also known as a working studio, guest apartment, or multitasking hybrid.)</p>
<p>Jaime also hoped to do a space-reclaiming opening of her family’s living space. She shares it with her life and business partner Guy Nattiv, a filmmaker (they co-founded New Native Pictures and won an Academy for &#8220;SKIN&#8221;), their daughters Alma and soon-to-be Mila, and their dog, Kiwi. The project had been on her To-Do list forever.</p>

<p>“We’d been wanting to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">convert our garage since day one</a>,” Jaime said, “but had struggled with the permitting situation.” The area where they live in L.A. required single-family homes to have two-space covered parking. When the law changed, Jaime recalled, “We said, Let’s do this.” They decided to renovate the house at the same time. “We realized that with two kids, we’d want an open floor plan, and a real closet and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary bath</a> for ourselves,” she said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46473 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16.jpg" alt="Jaime Newman" width="1000" height="1374" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16-218x300.jpg 218w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16-600x824.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>The home &amp; garage renovation team takes shape</h3>
<p>Jaime, whose work includes winning an Oscar as a producer, playing a recurring character Elizabeth Manwill in Hulu’s <em>Little Fires Everywhere</em> miniseries, as well as an essential district attorney role in Fox&#8217;s <em>Deputy</em>, had already gathered a reno dream team. “I bribed our dear friend Marcos Ferraez, a total visionary when it comes to imagining and reconfiguring a space, to come over and walk through the house,” she said. “We thought we needed to blow out the back of the house and add square footage, but we didn’t have the budget. I was stumped. Marcos completely reimagined our home within our current square footage.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
Everyone thought I was crazy to keep going. But we were in desperate need of an office&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage space</a> was next. Jaime hired <a href="https://www.haleyweidenbaum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">designer Haley Weidenbaum</a> to conceive of the layout and was stunned by Haley’s ability to maximize every square inch of the available 350 square feet. Haley also had a vision for the main living space, designing the primary bedroom and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. “Her talent and advice were invaluable,” Jaime said. From there she got on Sweeten and found her general contractor.</p>

<h3>Keeping family together during COVID</h3>
<p>Jaime was pretty clear on what she wanted. “I met with <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple contractors</a>. What I liked most about the one we hired was that he had style. His taste was always on point,” she said. “He was also <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very reasonable, and confident</a>.”</p>
<p>Like most of the world, the family had no idea of the uncertainty that lay ahead. For Jaime, in particular, early 2020 packed a punch. The COVID-19 threat loomed over the U.S. and then, she said, “my dad passed away in February.” Jaime wanted to support her mother and stay close by. It added up to difficult timing. “Everyone thought I was crazy to keep going,” she said. “But we were in desperate need of an office, and a separate space away from the kids so we could get work done,” Jaime said.</p>
<h3>Two designers for a Los Angeles garage remodel</h3>
<p>The project seemed to thrive on flux and change. “I realized at one point that much of our furniture no longer worked with the space, so we sold a lot of stuff on Facebook Marketplace to make room for new things,” she said. When Haley, who had started EVERHEM, a window-treatment company, got too busy and had to step away from the project, they brought in another designer.</p>

<p>“I have always had an Instagram crush on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madelynnfurlong/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design consultant Madelynn Furlong</a>,” Jaime said. “I asked if she’d be game to take us to the finish line and re-think the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/home-interior-design-trends-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design of the house</a>. Her aesthetic is unique and she finds the most interesting pieces.” Through Madelynn, Jaime discovered amazing companies like Muuto, Industry West, Lulu and Georgia, Constance Guisset, and Hudson Valley Lighting, among others. And the designer knew how to find one-of-a-kinds.</p>
<p>“Madelynn sent me a link to a giant, vintage burl wood dining table on Chairish for a terrific price, and said “BUY THIS NOW,” Jaime remembers. “It weighs 600 pounds. When it arrived, the household was blown away. This work of art will be passed down to my kids!”</p>

<p>Collaborating with two designers with very different feels was the most fun and satisfying part of the process, according to Jaime. Through them (and Pinterest), she found the original pieces and touches she wanted to make the space her own. Especially bath and kitchen design ideas. “I wanted something fun for our kitchen backsplash and I’m obsessed with Fireclay Tile, so that was easy! The bathroom floor needed to be non-slip, so we picked a slate from Clé Tile that we loved. I also fell head over heels for a hexagon tile from Popham Design.</p>

<h3>What does renovating feel like?</h3>
<p>Asked about a renovator’s most important virtue, Jaime chose patience. The process is long, she said, but your memory is short once you are settled in. “It’s kind of like after having your first baby!” the actor jokes. Confidence is also key, she said. These are massive decisions that you can’t turn back on, so hire a designer if you have doubts. And <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire a contractor</a> whose aesthetic you love.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad we lived in the house for years before renovating it, so we understood our needs and how best to accommodate them within <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our budget</a>,” Jaime said. Especially now, during COVID, she says, “We are in pure bliss here. The house is unique, but warm and inviting, a family compound and a comfortable respite. I cannot wait until we can have guests over!”</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Guest post by homeowner Michelle</em></p>
<h3>Finding the right contractors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My journey down the renovation rabbit hole began when I found myself picturing the dilapidated garage in the backyard as my dream “diva den,” as my best friend calls it. While researching different designs and models, I remembered an article on Sweeten I&#8217;d read a few years ago and had always wanted to use their services. It seemed like a no-brainer to have an intermediary help locate vetted contractors. It also solved the huge question of where to begin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since this was my first ever renovation project, I had no idea what my renovation would cost. Sweeten helped me modify my scope of work and nail down a realistic budget. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced me to a few contractors</a> who were a good match for my project. I finally felt like I had a team behind me, which is great once you start writing big checks.</p>

<h3>Planning the &#8220;she shed&#8221; garage remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I knew instantly that the first Sweeten contractor I met was the right fit for the job. Finally, I found someone as excited about my garage as I was! At that stage, I only had a basic idea of what I wanted. We took down most of the existing structure, retaining only the foundation. Since I was renovating a 12&#8242; x 19&#8242; garage, I wanted the interior to be basic and for the structure to retain the identity and functionality of a garage. That meant concrete floors, no molding, and a statement-making garage door. If you took out the rugs and furniture of the she shed, the structure could have use as a garage or workspace. I also wanted a calming space with one stipulation: no white walls.</p>
<h3>Experiencing a real-life renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with everyone on my contractor’s team was amazing. I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way. Most importantly, nobody exposed me for the complete novice that I was. Gaining an understanding of how everything worked also helped reign in some of my design ideas. To top off the contractor’s great service, he downloaded WhatsApp to stay in touch with me when I left for Cuba mid-project. I greatly appreciated his dedication to my peace of mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather was one of the biggest challenges during my project. It wasn’t an issue when my project started in August. However, when November arrived, it was either too cold, too rainy, or was supposed to rain but didn’t. Either way, there were a few bad weather days that halted work on The Shak. My contractor also had to juggle other clients. In my naiveté, I thought contractors worked on one project at a time. I came to understand that The Shak was my highest priority, but contractors work on other dream projects at the same time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25862 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-07-09.gif" alt="ladder to garage attic" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>Building a ladder to the attic</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the exterior took shape, and the interior work began, I became more involved in the project. That is also when my attention to detail heightened. For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage, we utilized the space</a>, we utilized the space above the ceiling. How to access that space became an hour-long discussion. I asked the contractor and his partner how I would get up to the storage space. &#8220;Use a ladder,&#8221; they said. &#8220;That’s what I do in my garage.&#8221; I’m no mathematician, but a nine-foot-tall ceiling plus a five-foot-tall girl does not equal easy movement of big boxes up a six-foot ladder. And where would I keep this ladder when I wasn’t using it? After a bit of selling on my part, they agreed to install an attic ladder. It was worth hashing out and in the end, my contractors loved the ladder too.</p>
<blockquote><p>I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Personalizing the &#8220;she shed&#8221; bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It may sound weird, but finding my dry-flush toilet was exciting. The she shed did not seem usable to me if you had to keep going into the house to use the bathroom. After endlessly searching for a toilet that did not need to be hooked up to sewage lines or have an odor, I came across a dry flush toilet. It is a great invention. It works like a Diaper Genie disposal system with a continuous bag that self-seals when “flushed,” then, a new portion of the bag opens for use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the bathroom is a small 3’ x 4’ space, I definitely wanted some over-the-top designs on the walls. I initially thought of using three-dimensional self-adhesive wall panels but decided against that since I wanted a mix of color and patterns. As a naturally curly-haired girl, the print I chose was a perfect fit for my preference of streamlined chaos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25844 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg" alt="garage bathroom remodel" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A tip on DIY wallpaper hanging</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, by the time I found the mural, the contractors had completed the interior space. So, my best friend and I enrolled in the university that is YouTube. After watching about twenty videos, we felt qualified to hang wallpaper, something neither of us had ever done before. I love what we accomplished, but some things take more skill and patience than she or I possess. I will never hang wallpaper again.</p>
<h3>Ultra-bold backsplash tiles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the contractor installed the sink and countertop, my <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next big project was the backsplash</a>. I wanted something different and eye-catching, something that would not bore me. I came across graffiti tiles but the designs weren&#8217;t bold enough. After feeling empowered with my new construction knowledge, I decided to decoupage my own tiles. We figured out the dimensions for the backsplash and measured out 5&#8242; x 2&#8242; worth of decoupage tiles as well as some purchased ones. It is one of my favorite things in The Shak. Now, when my friends come over, they all choose their favorite tile. I love how they invite interaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have never embarked on a project of this size. At times, it was scary. I would get a call at 8 a.m. from my contractor, asking <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which direction I wanted the French doors</a> to open or what size I wanted the windows to be, with no clue of how to respond. My advice to anyone starting a project would be to pick a contractor that listens to your ideas. It is also helpful to watch some YouTube videos, home improvement shows, or however else you like to educate yourself. The more a homeowner knows, the better he or she can direct the construction of their masterpiece. I couldn&#8217;t be happier with everything I accomplished in making The Shak a reality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How to remodel your garage into living space, a rental studio, or even a gym</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45280" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nashville-Garage-Blog.jpg" alt="garage remodel nashville" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nashville-Garage-Blog.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nashville-Garage-Blog-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you are like many homeowners, you may be looking in all directions to increase living space. Looking upward means building a second story. Looking toward the back translates to a house addition. But one direction that is often overlooked is to the side or front: the garage. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines how a garage remodel in Nashville could be your solution amid several home addition options. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Types of garage remodels</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Living rooms or family rooms</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Garages are often remodeled to provide supplemental living or family room space. The garage is insulated, wired, painted, and flooring is installed. Sometimes, a small powder room, with only a toilet and sink, is added. The powder room eliminates trips to the main part of the house.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Living quarters for renters</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some homeowners choose to install a self-contained apartment for renters. This arrangement can give the homeowner a source of passive income. Over the long term, it may defray the cost of the garage remodel. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Living quarters typically include a bedroom, full bathroom, and a kitchen. A lockable pass-through to the main part of the home is usually included. With this, homeowners can lock the door on their side to prevent the renters from entering. Most remodels of this nature include a separate exterior door so that renters can enter their apartment without going through the main house.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Living quarters for self or family</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Garages are often remodeled to provide living quarters for elderly parents, friends, or children. In many cases, this apartment has the same facilities as does an apartment for renters. </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Dedicated entertainment or work area</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your garage remodel may create a single room or multiple rooms for a specific purpose. The remodeled garage may become an entertainment room, home movie theater, gym, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/derelict-garage-finds-purpose-she-shed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office, workshop, or studio</a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Garage remodel costs in Nashville</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Garage remodel permits alone can cost $1,000 to $1,500. For a simple living-room space that does not include plumbing, the cost will begin in the $10,000 to $20,000 range. Most of this cost is devoted to outfitting the space with a floor and filling in the garage door.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">More often, though, garage remodels intended as living quarters begin at $20,000 and rise sharply.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Garage remodel process and timeline</span></h3>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Before you speak to a contractor, decide on the primary function for the remodel. A basic family or living room can be a relatively simple project since plumbing may not be involved. A full-scale rental apartment will be more expensive and will take several weeks or months.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">After you’ve <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">received multiple estimates</a> and chosen your contractor, discuss if any Nashville overlay and zoning issues need to be considered.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">You will meet with the contractor and an architect. The architect will draw up plans. The contractor applies for permits.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">After a roll-off dumpster is delivered to the property, workers demolish parts of the interior of the garage. The garage door is removed.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Carpenters fill in the empty space where the garage door was located. Usually, this will be an exterior wall system, complete with insulation and perhaps even windows.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Depending on the plan, workers may need to frame the floor with joists. This will raise the floor to the height of the main house’s floor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">With the walls open, electricians and plumbers run wire and pipes through the walls.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Carpenters frame the interior walls and the ceiling.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Workers add a heating and cooling system.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Drywall installers hang and finish the drywall.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Floor installers add the floor covering of your choice on top of the subfloor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">A painting team will paint the inside of the garage remodel. They will also paint areas outside of the garage, in front.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Plumbers finish installing bathroom fixtures. Electricians complete the rest of the wiring.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">How a garage remodel affects house value</span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">One important consideration before starting a garage remodel is whether it will increase the value of your home.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you are considering a garage remodel in Nashville, you might be thinking of immediate, personal needs. Your family may be increasing in size. Or you may have elderly parents who need housing. In either case, remodeling your garage may represent a lower net financial cost than building a separate structure or buying a new house.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">On the other hand, if you do intend to eventually sell your home, consider how the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">garage remodel will affect your home’s value</a>. Potential home buyers may view the lack of vehicle storage as a deficit. Other buyers may welcome the extra space.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Permits and restrictions</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The City of Nashville requires a building permit for any new building or a modification of an existing structure. You must also have permits for individual tradework, such as for electrical, plumbing, or HVAC work. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nashville is a city of many historic structures. The Nashville Metropolitan Historic Zoning Commission (MHZC) was formed to protect Nashville’s architectural styles and character. If your home is located in a historic preservation and historic landmark overlay, you must apply for a Preservation Permit.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">MHZC permit applications require a full set of plans, elevations, photos, and more. After you submit the permit application, the MHZC will meet to consider your project. After a permit is approved, you must stick to the conditions of the permit. For example, the MHZC will impose penalties or injunctions if the garage siding does not match that of the rest of the house.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Nashville and Davidson County, neighborhood leaders and government officials take a close look at Airbnb-type rentals. These types of rentals are called Short Term Rental Properties (STRPs). The Metro Codes Department must approve of your rental property before you list it as an STRP (but not before you build it).</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Heat and cool your garage remodel in Nashville</span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">With Nashville’s extremes of heat and cold, you should add a heating or cooling system to your garage remodel. Generally, there are three options:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li6"><span class="s3">Continue with the main house’s HVAC system. Workers continue the ductwork from the main house into the garage. The main house’s HVAC system must be adequate to handle the increased loads. This option works well when remodeling a garage for a living or family room: one that will flow seamlessly from the main house.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s3">Install a separate HVAC system. This is the best option when remodeling a garage as living quarters. It is also the costliest option.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s3">The lowest cost installation option is heating in the form of baseboard or wall heaters. For cooling, install one or more window or wall unit air conditioners. Installation is less expensive but the cost of service is higher. This is because baseboard heaters, wall heaters, and window unit A/Cs are less efficient than HVAC systems.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Where to park your vehicles</span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When reviewing permit applications for garage remodels in Nashville, the city will want to know where the displaced vehicles will go. Like most large cities, Nashville wants to reduce the number of cars that are street-parked.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you have a paved driveway, the solution can be as simple as moving the cars to the driveway instead of in the garage. This is the lowest cost solution, though your vehicles will be left out in the open.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you have ample room in the front of your property, you may wish to build a carport or even a new garage. This will completely or partially protect the vehicles. It also may appeal to future buyers. Zoning issues may come into play since a 20-foot setback in front must be maintained. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">A garage remodel is a lower-cost alternative to building an addition but it is not low-cost. Think of a garage remodel as an investment in your home’s value and in your happiness.</span></p>

</ul>
<h3>A new place to call home</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This New York homeowner had always owned property in Long Island&#8217;s Southampton, even while working overseas for over 10 years. Upon returning to the United States, she wanted to live closer to the village. So she sold one property and bought the other while still living overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house, located steps outside of the village, was a modest two-bedroom, one-bath, 800-square-foot 1960&#8217;s ranch with yellow aluminum siding. It previously had been a summer residence for an older couple who hadn’t touched it since the 1980s.</span></p>

<h3>A clear wishlist</h3>
<p>Not surprisingly, the interiors were outdated, storage was lacking, and space was tight. Still, she lived in the home for a year to better understand what she would like to change or improve. <span class="s1">“My vision was modern, functional, relaxed—and most importantly—timeless,” she said.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The beach community location inspired a relaxed vibe.</span><span class="s1"> “But I also wanted a cozy look that was inviting year-round for the cooler months.” said the homeowner. “The house is small and I wanted to keep it that way.” Larger entertaining space was critical while sleeping spaces weren’t as important. “I needed a bit more common space and modernization, including an open floor plan, natural light, and an indoor-outdoor connection,” she said. “Another bath and bedroom were also in the plans.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-diningroom-15.jpg" alt="ranch dining area" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44755" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-diningroom-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-diningroom-15-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-diningroom-15-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Finding a contractor</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With her Southampton home renovation ideas and concerns in mind, she posted her project to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free platform connecting homeowners to vetted general contractors, and found this Sweeten contractor. </span><span class="s1">She had three goals: a total renovation that included the kitchen; adding a third bedroom and second bath; and expanding the common living space by converting the garage. </span><span class="s1">“I could afford two of the three, but not all three,” she said.      </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">My contractor was honest: ‘I can give you this and this, but this is not in your budget.’ So I was able to decide what really mattered and make a very informed decision that I can live with.</span></p></blockquote>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-2.jpg" alt="ranch living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44612" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<h3>Refacing the kitchen cabinets</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The contractor and I talked through options and figured out how we could come closest to getting all three within my budget. Kitchens are expensive but I wouldn’t need to change the layout.”  </span><span class="s1">The homeowner also couldn’t afford to replace all the cabinets. Instead, she painted the lower portion in a darker gray, which masked the door’s oak grain. She refaced the uppers and purchased new doors to change up the style slightly. They went from an arched to a simple raised panel that visually connects with the those below the counter. Hard-to-reach cabinets above the refrigerator were eliminated. All the upper cabinets were painted white, which made the space seem larger.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-17.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44759" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-17-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-17-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-14.jpg" alt="refaced kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44758" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>New floors</h3>
<p>The <span class="s1">existing brown kitchen floor tile was removed and red oak was installed to be consistent with the rest of the house, all stained in a honey hue. New hardware also refreshed the cabinet doors. The contractor also swapped out outdated tile for a feature mosaic under the range hood, and white subway tile on the remaining backsplash. New stainless steel appliances replaced a white refrigerator and dishwasher, as well as a black range, for a cohesive contemporary look. The room also received a new pull-down faucet, sink, and quartz countertop.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“With some creative problem solving, it does look, feel, and function like <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/7-kitchen-trends-well-see-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a totally new kitchen</a>,&#8221; she said. </span><span class="s1">Without changing the kitchen footprint, she still picked up additional space. She calls her new walk-in pantry “icing on the cake.” The walk-in pantry is located just off the main kitchen, in part of what was the garage. “Everyone told me a garage conversion for storage was not a good idea because the space was just too small,&#8221; she recalled.</span></p>

<h3>Garage-turn-living room</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A crucial step in the Southampton home renovation was to have the 14’ x 24’ garage gutted, creating a new living room. The new room features a vaulted ceiling and a shiplap fireplace, as well as that walk-in pantry. Converting the garage expanded the 800-square-foot home to 1,350 square feet of living space. The homeowner wanted the fireplace to be a focal point. &#8220;I chose shiplap, </span>but the way it was executed was beyond my expectations,&#8221; the homeowner recalled. A shift in the spacing and a slightly larger scale made a huge difference. It was built up to the point of the vault and a thick slate mantle instead of a wood one made it a true statement piece. &#8220;My contractor designed and built it himself,&#8221; she said.</p>

<h3>A camouflaged finish</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additional storage, refrigeration, and less-used items moved into her new pantry. &#8220;I put my microwave and other small appliances behind closed doors,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;It’s still super convenient because it’s attached to the kitchen.” </span><span class="s1">The exterior roofline did not change. “I didn’t want it to look like a garage conversion </span><span class="s1">from the outside,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I built false carriage-style doors on the front exterior so it still looks like a garage.” </span></p>

<h3>Blue, white, and gray palette</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She settled on a mostly white color palette with some gray accents, including new charcoal paint on the exterior façade. The gray carrying over in slate at the front steps, rear entrance door, fireplace mantel, and one bath floor. Blue is a key decor thread, from the outside in. The exterior cladding has a bold new face in blue. In the main living spaces, the furniture has different shades of blue: pale blue well-worn painted metal stools at the counter; chairs around the dining table; and comfy chairs by the fireplace.</span></p>

<h3>Transom windows for light with privacy</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Updating the baths also made an enormous difference. &#8220;</span>I happen to love transom windows for some reason,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I placed them particularly in the bathrooms for maximum light with maximum privacy.&#8221; <span class="s1">The master bath’s large walk-in shower are clad in 12’ x 24’ white stone-like Dolomite porcelain tile, with a dark gray porcelain tile grounding the floor. </span><span class="s1">Another update features a stylish new furniture-like vanity in honey-colored wood with horizontal grain that sits on brass feet, paired with a brass faucet.</span></p>

<h3>It all comes together</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Her favorite part of her Southampton home renovation actually was the last third of the job. </span><span class="s1">“Each day there was something new, so I could see actual material being installed and the end in sight, versus &#8220;behind-the-walls&#8221; work like plumbing, electrical, gas lines, and new joists,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have windows—yay! I have stained wood floors—yay! As you get close to the end, you start to see your vision in real-time, with day-to-day progress. It makes all frustrations melt away, and you are a very happy person.”</span></p>

<h3>A calm and satisfying finished product</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing the homeowner appreciated was honesty and expertise. “My Sweeten contractor was very patient, accommodating, efficient, and professional. Most importantly, a problem solver. My budget was tight, but I was given solutions that did not break the bank,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My contractor was honest: ‘I can give you this and this, but this is not in your budget.’ So I was able to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decide what really mattered</a> and make a very informed decision that I can live with. I am grateful for this.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hands down, her favorite feature is the fireplace. </span><span class="s1">“And adding windows on either side,&#8221; she said. “It’s lovely to watch the changes in the season through the windows but have complete privacy.” </span><span class="s1">The experience of a home renovation in Southampton has been positive.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She concluded, “It makes me calm and satiated, confirming that I made the right decisions and that it all turned out as I planned—I got my dream home with my finances intact.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Chilling scenes transform to happy ever afters</h2>
<p>In the renovation world, nothing is more satisfying than witnessing the evolution of a dark “before” into a dream-come-true space. These kitchens and baths started out as unwelcoming, dated, and in some cases, unfunctional rooms. With help from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors, they took a complete 360°.</p>

<p>Even the homeowner, Kristen, recognized the fear-factor of her studio bathroom. “The shower and tub had gotten a little scary,” she said. Already dark due to a lack of windows, the floor-to-ceiling slate tile certainly wasn’t helping matters. Building regulations prevented plumbing reconfiguration, but the cosmetic changes, from fresh paint to new fixtures, were more than enough to transform the space.</p>

<p>This co-op kitchen hadn’t been renovated since the ‘80s—and it showed. The mismatched walls, dated cabinets, and overhead lighting gave the space an eerie vibe that called for a full gut renovation. The limited counter space (only 24 square inches!) and cabinets were swapped for floor-to-ceiling white cabinets, updated appliances, and quartz countertops.</p>

<em>(Above)</em> A Westchester<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/shaker-style-simplicity-in-a-pelham-kitchen/"> kitchen</a></p>
<p>Both form and function were lost on this townhouse kitchen. The vinyl flooring, beige countertops, and dark brown cabinets were straight out of a ‘70s nightmare, not to mention many of the appliances didn’t even work. Eager to get it in functioning condition, these renovators gave the kitchen a much-needed facelift with new shaker cabinets, a slate tile floor, and most importantly, brand new appliances.</p>

<p>The pink tile and overall decrepit bathroom didn’t dissuade Matt from buying his home. It did, however, lead to a complete remodel. He wanted a clean, neutral space that he and potential future subletters or owners could also enjoy. A walk-in shower and modern floating vanity brought in a modern yet classic sensibility.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tortured&#8221; was the best way to describe the kitchen in an East Flatbush rowhouse. The dropped ceiling and dark paneling could make anyone who dared to enter feel trapped. The renovators saw the potential and moved forward in creating a chef-worthy kitchen designed for entertaining.</p>
