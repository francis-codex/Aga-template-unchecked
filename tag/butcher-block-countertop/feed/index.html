										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A kitchen pares down with integrated appliances in a landmark Brooklyn building</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-kitchen-custom-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen with custom cabinets and kitchen island with butcher block after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Expanding a cramped kitchen in a Clinton Hill landmark townhouse</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: In 2013, Kate and her husband, Graham, purchased a 4-unit townhouse built in 1890 in Clinton Hill, and moved into it with her two brothers and their families. (They operate the apartments within the townhouse as informal condos and share costs and decision-making.) While they knew that there were changes that needed to be made, they did not consider a gut renovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-01-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" title="over-door-detailing-entrance-before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-01-723x482.jpg" alt="over door detailing and entrance before renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets and white counter before renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Four years down the line, after living in the space, they determined that expanding and redoing a tiny kitchen that was tucked into the back corner of their apartment was a priority. It was closed off from the rest of the apartment inside an addition to the original house. The addition had been divided into a small galley kitchen and a second room that was “too small to be a living room or a dining room,” explained Kate. The narrow kitchen had small, outdated appliances and the refrigerator was awkwardly placed in front of a window. It was hard for two people to pass each other in the space. Given that the kitchen did not function at all the way their family needed it to, the couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/21244" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project to Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Working with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Sweeten contractor</a>, Kate and Graham envisioned an open space so that meal prep could be “a family activity and a space for doing homework while dinner was getting made,” said Kate. They wanted to go vertical with custom cabinets and counters to maximize the amount of surface and storage space. While they did need to remove a wall and a closet, they were intent on retaining as much of the original wood and plaster detailing as possible so that the new kitchen would pair seamlessly with the rest of the prewar apartment.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen, landmark townhouse, white cabinets, pendant lights" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-kitchen-space-white-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="white open kitchen space with white kitchen cabinets and brown dining table after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pantry cabinet next to the sink got a makeover; the glass panels had either been replaced with plywood or painted over, so they had new glass put in. It now makes a nice display for cookbooks and spices. &#8220;We believe that before the addition was put on the back of the house, that door would have been the exterior door to the yard,&#8221; said Kate. Demo revealed that the molding and flooring had continued throughout the original space as they predicted. The new layout also allowed more light into the rest of the apartment.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" title="white-overhead-kitchen-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="white overhead kitchen cabinets over white quartz counter and open shelves after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="wide-doorway-white-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="wide doorway to a white kitchen space with white cabinets and pendant lights after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kate and Graham chose integrated appliances for a built-in look. Given that the kitchen is now in plain view from the rest of the apartment, they did not want it “to scream ‘kitchen,’” explained Kate. The refrigerator replaces what used to be a closet and looks as if it has always been there, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disguised by a cabinet front</a>. They attempted to minimize stainless steel with hardware and cabinet choices that were “understated, practical, and looked more like built-in furniture.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-06-723x1085.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-cabinets-small-white-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="white cabinets and a small white counter along with brown dining table after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While quartz was chosen for the backsplash and countertops around the stove and sink for its durability, they softened up the space by topping the oversized island with butcher block. The wood floors were sanded and refinished for continuity with the rest of the home.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-08.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-cabinets-white-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-08.gif" alt="white cabinets and a white counter on a brown vinyl floor after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinetry</a> was the most expensive choice that Kate and Graham made, but they &#8220;were committed to this expense from the beginning because [they] knew it was the only way to maximize storage space and because the cabinets are by far the most prominent feature of the kitchen,&#8221; said Kate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because they did not use an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/when-do-you-need-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect</a>, there was quite a bit of &#8220;game-time decision-making&#8221; that slowed things down. Now that the project is finished, however, the whole family loves the space. “The kids show off the fact that the fridge and microwave are hidden behind doors to everyone who comes over. We all spend most of our together-time in the kitchen now,&#8221; said Kate. &#8220;And when people come over, it&#8217;s where everyone inevitably ends up hanging out.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: By hiding ductwork behind the upper cabinets, the couple was able to remove the drop ceiling in the kitchen to gain more height in the space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Prepping to pick kitchen countertop materials? Let these 9 Sweeten-remodeled kitchens inspire you</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just because kitchen counters get a lot of use in the home doesn&#8217;t mean they can&#8217;t also look beautiful! But where should you start when picking kitchen countertop materials? Well, there are a few things you should know about each type of countertop material before making your final selection. Here&#8217;s a rundown of our favorite kitchen countertops from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> renovation projects: gorgeous photos <em>and </em>material descriptions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27214 size-chrono" title="countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-723x482.jpg" alt="countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-13618"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Quartz Countertops</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quartz is a type of engineered stone, made from a combination of minerals, pigment, and resin. It is available in a wide range of colors and texture complexity. Quartz has become the most popular kitchen countertop material in <a href="https://sweeten.com/kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten kitchen renovations</a> probably because it is slightly less expensive, per square foot, than some of its other natural stone cousins, and because it is prized for extreme durability, resistance to stains and scratches, and its non-porous surface, which helps retain polish without sealants or waxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Ketrina’s Sweetened Clinton Hill Kitchen – Homeowner Guest Post" href="https://sweeten.com/clintonhillcoops/ketrinas-sweetened-clinton-hill-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13005 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-03.jpg" alt="Ketrina Quartz Kitchen Countertop" width="600" height="901" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-03-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>

<p><a title="Ketrina’s Sweetened Clinton Hill Kitchen – Homeowner Guest Post" href="https://sweeten.com/clintonhillcoops/ketrinas-sweetened-clinton-hill-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ketrina in Clinton Hill</a> chose a quartzite countertop in cream-colored Madreperola (Mother of Pearl).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Heather’s Sweetened Upper West Side Kitchen Renovation – Homeowner Guest Post" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/heathers-sweetened-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather</a> went with <a href="https://www.lgviaterausa.com/productOverviews/33/by-product-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG’s Viatera</a> quartz countertop in Cirrus for her Upper West Side kitchen.</p>
<h3><strong>Granite Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Granite is a natural stone with wide variation in color and detail. Its resistance to heat and scratches makes it a classic in the kitchen. Granite is known for its durability, but can require periodic re-sealing.</p>

More porous and softer than granite and engineered stone, (marble counters need to be sealed and are more susceptible to stains and etching), design-focused renovators seem to be willing to put up with marble&#8217;s drawbacks for its uncontested good looks.</p>

<h3><strong>Soapstone Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Highly heat-, stain-, and bacteria-resistant, soapstone is a non-porous natural stone that is available in a range of light to dark gray matte tones, all with subtle veining. Unlike granite and marble materials that require sealing, soapstone needs regular polishing with mineral oil to help conceal surface scratches and add patina.</p>

<h3><strong>Dekton Countertops</strong></h3>
<p>A tougher and more durable alternative to concrete countertops, Dekton is an ultra-compacted hybrid of raw materials common to quartz, porcelain, and glass. The result is a virtually impenetrable surface with a grittier, industrial feel.</p>

<h3><strong>Butcher block countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ideal for adding warmth and charm, butcher block wood countertops provide a hardworking surface for food preparation. A number of Sweetened kitchens have mixed wood countertop sections with other materials like natural or engineered stone. This mix provides different options for food prep and serving. While butcher block is naturally heat-resistant and affordable, it can stain and age, wear in high-use areas and requires regular sanding and oiling to protect the wood.</p>
