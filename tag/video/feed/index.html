<p>Emily Henderson, TV host and namesake behind the <a href="https://stylebyemilyhenderson.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Style By Emily Henderson</a> blog, and Sweeten&#8217;s founder, Jean Brownhill, have a conversation on making your best home through remodeling and design. Read some of Emily&#8217;s &#8220;aha!&#8221; interior design tricks and insight below.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Jean: Emily, what are your interior design tips to get more space or maximize small spaces?</h3>
<p><strong>Emily:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Multi-functional furniture</span></p>
<p>Think double-duty, for sure—ottomans with storage, sideboards that have cabinets. When you’re looking for furniture, think, “could this also have another function, a storage function?” That definitely helps.</p>
<p>In a smaller space, having less furniture will help you. It’s easy to be like,  &#8220;Well, this is a small sofa and then I have this small chair and this small chair…” and sometimes all of that will actually end up making the room look smaller because it’s busier. Think about bringing as little contrast as possible if you’re trying to make a room feel and look bigger.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid a focal wall</span></p>
<p>Sometimes the desire is to have a focal wall, which I totally get. But it does chop up the space. It makes your eye feel like the space is smaller when it’s chopped up. We have an accent wall rule, and we&#8217;ve blogged about it before…essentially, if it&#8217;s a niche, if it&#8217;s a dedicated space that architecturally is addressed differently, then that&#8217;s a great opportunity for an accent wall. But if you have four walls in a room, don&#8217;t just paint one a different color—it just kind of chops up the space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24.jpg" alt="studio bedroom and living room" width="800" height="538" class="alignnone wp-image-48381 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24-600x404.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners hired designer Julia Oddo for their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/small-space-renovation-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studio apartment renovation</a></p>
<h3>Jean: When and who should be hiring a designer?</h3>
<p><strong>Emily:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lack of time and experience</span></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re doing a pretty big renovation, whether it&#8217;s a whole house or even just doing your kitchen, and you truly don&#8217;t have the time, the desire, or experience, it&#8217;s a good idea to<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> think about hiring an interior designer</a> strictly because you&#8217;re going to make mistakes. Even we make mistakes all the time. It&#8217;s a luxury service, but I would say if you don&#8217;t have the time to really do the research to figure out how you want it to look and have the experience, then an interior designer will benefit you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Design on the next level</span></p>
<p>Hiring an interior designer will take your house to the next level. You&#8217;ll probably get more custom pieces. It&#8217;ll look more unique than if you bought all from different big box stores, but you don&#8217;t have to do it. You truly don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The internet has made an average homeowner able to buy a great sofa. And because of Pinterest and Instagram, people can really do it themselves. Again, you&#8217;re still going to probably make some mistakes, but that&#8217;s okay. Whereas I think 30, 40 years ago, they didn&#8217;t have the resources. We didn&#8217;t have the stores.</p>
<p><strong>Jean:</strong> You always talk about how you want your house to feel. Interior designers don’t just create a vibe. They deal with the elements of the actual things that you feel and touch, like the sofas and pillows.</p>
<p><strong>Emily:</strong> Yeah, and that&#8217;s my favorite stuff for sure. It&#8217;s the layering that makes it feel like a unique home.</p>
<h3>Jean: How do we save time and money designing a home?</h3>
<p><strong>Emily:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do the preliminary work</span></p>
<p>If you’re working with an interior designer, and you have a pretty clear vision, that saves them a lot of guessing, a lot of back and forth. If you have a sofa you love, show it to them, because they&#8217;re going to source 10 different sofas to show to you and that takes time. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-interior-design-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interior designer&#8217;s costs</a> for their time is usually on an hourly basis. So I think the more work you can do upfront, the better.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spend on &#8220;wow&#8221; pieces</span></p>
<p>I have a different philosophy on where to splurge and save than everybody I know. These days there are very good sofas out there that are not that expensive that will also last for years. I feel like you should splurge on the conversation pieces like that amazing rug that nobody else has or a really great piece of art that will create a conversation. They&#8217;re the pieces you typically see that are vintage or custom, where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh my God, I need&#8230;&#8221; That is going to just shift everything in the room and elevate everything.</p>
<h3>Jean: Can you tell us what to do with blank or boring walls?</h3>
<p><strong>Emily:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personality for each wall</span></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of awesome DIY artwork out there right now. I do have a rule about decorating your walls. When designing a room, address every wall differently with a different style. One wall might be a gallery wall, one might be a mirror, one might be a diptych, and one might be a sculpture. Whether it&#8217;s a gallery, big single art piece or diptych, grid, sculpture, or mirror, those are the five go-to&#8217;s that we use to address all walls.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled.jpg" alt="dining area with gallery wall and open shelves above a piano" width="1707" height="2560" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47432" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s dining area and <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gallery wall</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Art is the key</span></p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re looking around and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I have one small piece on that, one small piece on that wall,&#8221; that might be something that you could change pretty easily that would make your house feel more styled, more pulled together. Also, art is the number one way to make your house feel like a unique, personalized space for sure.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Mitzie and Jenifer bought their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-bedroom apartment in DUMBO</a>, they knew that a full home renovation was needed before moving in. A designer, Mitzie immediately started sketching out design plans and reached out to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a general contractor who could bring those plans to life. In the home renovation tips below, Mitzie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shares the couples&#8217; bedroom and kitchen renovation inspiration, and their experience working with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3918#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Sweeten general contractor</a> to improve the lighting in their new apartment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:05)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to our home. My name is Mitzie Wong. I live here with my partner Jenifer Harmon, who is a media executive. I&#8217;m a painter, designer, and co-founder of <a href="https://roarandrabbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roar + Rabbit</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:35)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to make the apartment feel very casual, yet luxurious. We had a budget in mind, so we were really careful about choosing the materials. We wanted it to feel very inviting and relaxing.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_41443" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41443" class="wp-image-41443 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16.jpg" alt="kitchen and living room, kitchen renovation, living room renovation, home renovation tips for kitchen and living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-41443" class="wp-caption-text">Photos by Kate Glicksberg for Sweeten</p></div>
<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 1: </strong>A waterfall island brings living spaces together</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:53)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we saw the kitchen initially, it was very boxy. There were lots of angles, the cabinets were jutting out, the counters were short and narrow, so we wanted to make the place a lot more cohesive. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went for a bigger island</a>, deeper with the cascading waterfall marble sides, so it would be a feature because it&#8217;s an open plan to the living room. And we unified everything by color. Being an open plan, it had to be a feature. We hid the freezer and the fridge behind the same colors as the cabinet to make it more unified. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44522 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03.jpg" alt="home renovation designs, home renovation sketches" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We used the same hardware on the drawers and the doors to make it more cohesive, to give it a lighter and brighter space, and we obviously brought the counter forward to give it more a generous sense of space. Because everything was so new looking, I wanted to put in a handmade tile to just soften it up, to give it some texture and some depth.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41431 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03.jpg" alt="bedroom, bedroom renovation, home renovation tips for bedrooms" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 2: Turn a plain wall into a colorful headboard</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (01:58)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a fairly new building, it&#8217;s only 12 years old, so we wanted to give the apartment some character. As you&#8217;ll see, there&#8217;s a lot of build-outs and recesses and weird angles in each corner. I wanted to take the focal point away and make a feature wall. I used two-and-a-half-inch plywood beams and painted it to make an accent wall to give it layered depth. If you look slightly to the right, you&#8217;ll see the Manhattan bridge, and it&#8217;s a gray-blue, so that was part of the inspiration for the color. It&#8217;s a slightly off-color of the Manhattan bridge.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 3: </strong>Streamline storage and lighting</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (02:40)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We relied on our Sweeten contractor heavily on their expertise for lighting. They dropped the ceilings only two or three inches, and we were able to put in the recessed lighting in both the living room and the office, so we could maintain consistent lighting throughout the day and evening. When we were doing the initial renovation during the gutting stage, there was an additional six inches in the wall [of the master bathroom] that was revealed, so we were able to design together and build a bespoke cabinet.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:06</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Jean! Hey, how are you?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:07</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Hey, I&#8217;m great. How are you?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:08</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">I wanted to introduce you to our builder, Dave.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:10</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Hey, nice to meet you.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:11</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Hi Dave.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:11</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Jean&#8217;s with Sweeten.com, and she specializes in matching homeowners with renovation experts. And so she&#8217;s seen demos, renos, and all the kinds&#8230;(<em>laughs</em>).</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:22</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Oh, yeah, we literally have seen everything.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:22</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Yeah.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:23</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;re really glad to have Jean from Sweeten here because we have this un-permitted breezeway that the Holtzclaw&#8217;s inherited. And she knows what it takes to solve these problems.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:33</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">A lot of times that happens, you&#8217;ll buy a home and you think you can renovate something that&#8217;s been un-permitted and it&#8217;s like peeling back layers of a nightmare, right?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:40</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s like a Pandora&#8217;s box. So once you touch one thing, you know this?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:45</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Yeah.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:45</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Everything has to be up to code.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:46</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Yeah.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:46</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">You can&#8217;t just fix the electrical. You have to fix the plumbing, you have to fix the structural, and the foundation. And I think that people think that like, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t need to hire a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed general contractor</a>. You know, it&#8217;s too expensive or it&#8217;s too cumbersome.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:57</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Yeah.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:58</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">But the reason why there is a license to be a general contractor is because you have people&#8217;s safety in mind. And this space is obviously not that.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:06</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Absolutely.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:08</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">So first thing that we need to do is strip all these walls. So we&#8217;re going to demo all these walls, get it down to studs.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:12</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Amazing.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:12</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">All right.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:13</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">All right, You ready?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:13</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Yeah.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:13</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">What are we waiting for?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:14</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">All right, I got a hammer for you. Swing away.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:20</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Nice.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k614tTkA76Q"><img decoding="async" title="blue-background-white-lettering"  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11003" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/corcoranPresentsSweeten_videoSeries-3.png" alt="blue background and white lettering of video still" width="600" height="327" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/corcoranPresentsSweeten_videoSeries-3.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/corcoranPresentsSweeten_videoSeries-3-300x164.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know first-hand how daunting it can be to envision renovation options as you&#8217;re standing in a crowded open house. This week, we are beyond psyched to share a first look at our new partnership with <a href="https://www.corcoran.com/nyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corcoran</a>, New York&#8217;s preeminent real estate group. We&#8217;ll be partnering with Corcoran to help buyers and sellers demystify the renovation process, understand design options for particular properties, and break down potential upgrades at various price points. Over the next few months, you&#8217;ll see more information for first-time buyers about how to value renovations for properties on the market, ideas for new homeowners looking to undo the renovation decisions of prior owners, and guidance for sellers looking to maximize their re-sale value or refresh a property before it gets listed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our first video take, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> founder and CEO, Jean Brownhill Lauer, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Kent</a> run us through kitchen renovation options, in under a minute, for a <a href="https://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/2840734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-bedroom apartment</a> on the market for $525,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.corcoran.com/nyc/listings/display/2840734"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10990" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SWEETEN_corcoran-59madison-01-02.png" alt="SWEETEN_corcoran-59madison-01-02" width="600" height="200" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SWEETEN_corcoran-59madison-01-02.png 659w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SWEETEN_corcoran-59madison-01-02-300x100.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SWEETEN_corcoran-59madison-01-02-600x200.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep the budget in the $10k &#8211; $30k range, Jean focuses in on the most immediately visible elements of the kitchen: new tile and backsplash, under-cabinet lighting, painting cupboards, and a possible high-impact splurge on new countertops. With a $30k &#8211; $60k budget, Jean and Kent help us picture a more transformative project: opening the kitchen up to the living room, creating a custom prep and dining island, bringing millwork finishes from the living room to new kitchen cabinetry, and re-doing the kitchen floor. Now press play!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re just getting started with this new Corcoran collaboration and can&#8217;t wait to share more with you as the spring real estate market warms up. Stay tuned for more in the works from Jean and Team Sweeten.</p>
