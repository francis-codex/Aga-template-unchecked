<h3>Choosing between a house or apartment</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My husband and I used to live in Manhattan in a one-bedroom apartment. Once we decided to have children, we knew we wanted to live closer to our families. So we opted to buy a house in the Bronx and have our parents partake in child-raising. Originally we thought we would have one child, live in the area for a few years, and then move back to Manhattan once school started. </span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="s1">We were most excited about having a bathroom on the first floor and not having to go upstairs.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Our house addition plan: Envisioning more space</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, we soon fell in love with having a house and wanted to have more kids. Our neighborhood is quite ethnically and socioeconomically diverse. It feels like a nice mix, like we’re away from the city, but not quite in the suburbs. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We wanted more living space on the first floor because it’s where we spend most of our time as a family. We also wanted our children, who are 9, 6, and 3, to have larger bedrooms and decided to add a 250-square-foot attic dormer for that purpose. The idea was for the new space to be airy and maximize the view of beautiful trees in our backyard. Our 280-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement converted</a> into a ping pong room for extra recreational space.</span></p>

<h3>Transformation outside the kitchen</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, the window that previously looked out on the old deck was converted to a passthrough window that now connects to the new sunroom. The kitchen countertop was extended about two feet to the end of the wall that divides the dining area and kitchen. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Off of the kitchen, we added a 280-square-foot sunroom that includes a bathroom, pantry room, and living area. We were most excited about having a bathroom on the first floor and not having to go upstairs. The pantry provides tons of food, toy, and sports equipment storage. The new <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor deck</a> is off of the sunroom and is 250 square feet.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our favorite part of the renovation was working with the architect and our Sweeten general contractor on the layout of the new rooms.</span> <span class="s1">However, the most anxiety-provoking situation was waiting for support beams to be delivered and installed. For two days we had no roof and obsessed about checking the weather to make sure it didn’t rain! </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor had experience with all aspects of our project. He was great at giving us ideas and then executing the plan. We also shared the same taste in simple, modern, open design. He was able to deliver exactly what we envisioned. And if you need to file for city permits, our advice is to use an architect who can do that. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was great to have Sweeten follow up every step of the way. We knew Sweeten would be there if we experienced problems with our contractor. Luckily, we didn’t need that assistance. Our contractor’s team was excellent!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our new house addition space makes us feel less crowded. Now, our children can grow and play without feeling like we’re being swallowed up by all of their toys.</span></p>

<h3>Starting a major renovation</h3>
<p>Sandra is an educator and I&#8217;m a music movement instructor.  Our three children are Julian, 24, Abigail, 18, and Avery,17, plus we have a 2-year-old dog, Blue. We purchased our first home in 1997 after living on the top floor of a private home located in South Slope, Brooklyn, for about seven years.</p>
<p>We did not focus on any major renovations to the house until 2018. The house is a charming red brick Tudor-style home originally built by an Armenian family in 1922.</p>

<h3>Hiring a contractor</h3>
<p>Our vision for our project really began with a desperate need to makeover our &#8217;70s kitchen. Eventually, we began to see that the rest of the main level was also crying out for a change. Sweeten was a very interesting website that my wife spotted while doing her research. We loved the stories and photos displayed with the recommendations of contractors. We had site visits with two and immediately felt a connection with the Sweeten contractor we would ultimately hire.  We shared our concerns regarding how difficult it will be to tackle an old house and, of course, our budget.</p>
<p>We loved that the house did not intimidate our contractor at all. We shared our ideas and all our concerns with him and within two weeks, a proposal was handed to us that included a renovation for the kitchen, the entire main level floor, and important necessary improvements of the entire lower level family room.</p>

<h3>Changing the layout</h3>
<p>One of the challenges we faced was how to end the years of living with drafts and cold temperatures in our home.  The draft we experienced came from the dining window where the large permanent air conditioner sat on the ledge for years, the office space (now the sunroom) that included nine old large windows, and the old kitchen exit door.</p>
<p>We also could not see nor understand how to expand the space for comfort. After a solid consultation with our Sweeten contractor, permission was granted to include in our home improvement budget a cooling and heating system and knock down existing walls in order to create new space and bring in outside light.</p>

<h3>Knocking out a door</h3>
<p>The most exciting part of the project for us was eliminating the old <span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> door and replacing it with a large window that brings in sunlight. Adjacent, the office space was transformed into a sunroom with a huge new pantry for multiple-purpose storage and a new glass deck door.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have developed a new confidence working with our contractor and hope that very soon we will have him back to renovate the upper level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We considered tearing down all the walls of the house but had a change of heart because of the mosaic of details spotted throughout the house.  Our contractor&#8217;s wise tip with our project was to keep in mind that the house was built decades ago and that we can save so much of the budget if we come up with a fresh new look without disturbing too much of the original plumbing, electrical, and gas connections.</p>

<h3>Decluttering and blending materials</h3>
<p>We both shared a love of antiques and traditional aesthetics. We have lived in our house for 20 years and never updated our look. We realized that a simpler, uncluttered, Zen look is what we needed. We traded the original maple-colored parquet floors throughout the main floor, including the kitchen, with a delicious chocolate-colored plank wood that reminds us of rich gardening soil. We also wanted to include materials and hues that immediately took us back to nature—silver grays, dairy whites, and galaxy black. The color of the walls was chosen as a canvas to complement all of the materials chosen.</p>

<h3>Working as a team</h3>
<p>We owe it to Sweeten for matching us with the general contractor for our project. He did nothing but listen until he totally understood the vision and ran with it. He led our construction journey in such a peaceful transformation. We loved how he unselfishly gave us the liberty to do some of our own research on materials we really loved, and then with only some of the higher-priced items would he suggest his connections at a lower price to keep us on the budget without losing the integrity of the look. The budget was our biggest concern with our renovation and he always kept it in check. His team was just as amazing. We enjoyed having them arrive on our project every day and some weekends.</p>

<h3>A stunning outcome</h3>
<p>We cannot express how much we love the new kitchen shared with the dining space, living room, sunroom, and our newly improved lower-level family chill room. The entire new space gives us a sensational feel of living outside instead of inside. We are completely covered with so much light and warmth. We recently celebrated our son, Julian’s 24th birthday by inviting 22 guests ages 17-26. They had all visited our home prior to the renovation and they literally felt as if they were in another house. They could not get over the transformation.</p>
<p>We are thrilled our Sweeten contractor truly helped us to create a Zen space that works well with everything, including our antique pieces. I really believe that something needs to be said about the old working in a harmonious manner with the new. We have developed new confidence working with our contractor and we are hoping that very soon we will have him back to renovate the upper level including the family bathroom. But first, we must concentrate on building, once again, our home improvement budget.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Sandra and Nelson. We hope your family enjoys your new home!</em></p>
