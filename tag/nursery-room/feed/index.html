<p>For us, a fixer-upper was a must.</p>
<p>There was the professional itch; as an interior designer for an architecture firm specializing in Brooklyn brownstones, I had house-envy. I had a Pinterest board called &#8220;Someday house ideas&#8221; slowly filling with the most affordable versions of all my favorite finishes. It has 600 pins.</p>
<p>And then there was practicality; although we loved our huge and quirky one-bedroom in Boerum Hill, it had no way to create a second bedroom and no access to the sleeping area except a dizzying spiral staircase. Time to move on.</p>
<p>In our (VERY) stressful house hunt, we were the runner-up offer on four houses before The One. It was an unusually wide two-family brick Tudor townhouse in Kensington, around the corner from my husband’s elementary school. The block is tiny and quiet, across from a beautiful gatehouse of Greenwood Cemetery. There is a bountiful apricot tree in the front yard and a huge grapevine in the back. There was even—the Brooklyn equivalent of a tennis court or horse stables—a driveway.  But the best part was the friendly atmosphere. Many of our neighbors have lived their entire lives on this block, and we were thrilled to join them.</p>
<p>It was a major job, though. The home had only one owner since it was built in 1941, and it had been decades since the home had been well-maintained. Everything practical had to go: plumbing, gorgeous-but-ruined steel windows, cloth-wrapped aluminum electrical wiring that the home inspector begged us to replace &#8220;so I can sleep at night. Really. Please. PLEASE.&#8221;</p>
<p>The structure was great, however, and it was full of personality and charm. I adored the arched doorways and beautiful 1950s Caloric stove, and I wanted to maintain &#8217;40s details even where everything would be new. I collected bright and cheerful images of tiled bathrooms, Airstream-inspired kitchens, and patterned floors. I prepared a full set of construction drawings, selected all my finishes, and looked for a contractor.</p>
<p>I know some general contractors that my office uses, but I wanted to keep my personal renovation separate to avoid conflicts of interest. I was thrilled to find Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a>, and then selected a contractor from a list of really excellent matches. I got pregnant, and the clock began to tick as we ran into a contract delay with the team we’d chosen. I was paralyzed with stress, back at square one with a due date and a house full of lead paint and death-wiring, holed up in the basement with my belongings around my ears like a hoarder. There was some crying. But I called Sweeten, and they swooped into action. Within 48 hours, they had amicably resolved the issue and found me three new excellent contractors to interview, all of whom could start immediately. Our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> was particularly impressive, calling me with thoughtful questions about my drawing set and offering ideas for cost-savings. I could not believe how fast the Sweeten team saved the day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our house was originally a two-bedroom apartment on the top floor, with a duplex on the first floor and garden level. But at some point, the garden level had been finished as an apartment in its own right, and we preferred to have our duplex upstairs with rentable space on the bottom. By eliminating the need for a separate entrance to the second floor, we were able to open up the center staircase to the living room and turn the entry from a dark, tiny box into an open alcove, flooding the front of the house with light. The difference has been amazing.</p>
<p>We also took advantage of a neat arched niche that sat between two closets in the bedroom on the first floor. The back wall of this niche was up against the kitchen, and by punching through, we created a doorway from the kitchen into what is now the dining room. Suddenly there was a clear view all the way through the house, without removing the lovely original details.</p>

<p>The kitchen was designed around the amazing old stove and a salvaged Sub-Zero fridge that I found for a song at Build It Green in Gowanus. The front panel was a dark glossy charcoal, which was already what I had been thinking about for my lower cabinets. It was fate. I did the uppers in matte white, with a pretty hand-made subway tile that has an uneven surface that reflects light softly. I like to have my cooking ingredients out all the time, so I had the cabinets installed unusually high to fit a shelf for jars underneath. The counters are a honed Jet Mist granite, which gave me the look of soapstone without any of its typical green tint, which would have clashed with my Sub-Zero.</p>
<p>I snagged a vintage enamel sink from BIG, and paired it with the restaurant-style sprayer faucet of my dreams from Signature Hardware. It lives up to the hype. Our most unusual score was the island, which I happened upon one night as I drove down the block on my way home from work. It’s an amazing furniture piece that a neighbor was throwing away, exactly the perfect dimension for our kitchen. Although I planned to replace the top with butcher block, I have so loved the wavy green tiles that I’ve kept it just as I found it.</p>

<p>Our other first-floor change was to shrink the original full bath down to a powder room, using the space that housed the tub as a walk-in pantry off the kitchen. The original baths were all an intense pink with raspberry accents &#8211; pink walls, pink floor, pink toilet, pink tub. Every pink its very own shade! The coolest discovery came in peeling off the wild pink floral wallpaper; directly on the original walls, we found delicate hand-painted Chinoiserie scenes of a river, swans, and boats. A neighbor told us that all the houses had them, but that slowly over the years they’ve been lost. Sadly, it was badly damaged, so we only have photos.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new powder room is wonderful, though, and a better use for our space. I used a salvaged pedestal sink and a window from Olde Good Things for a high transom, so the room isn’t entirely cut off from its original window. And at long last, we found a home for the Brooklyn Toile wallpaper from Flavor Paper (made just one block away from our old apartment!), which was designed by Mike D from the Beastie Boys. My husband spent years longing for this paper, which features a dreamy mix of Notorious B.I.G. and angelic Nathan’s hot dogs and men in fur hats and Park Slope stroller mommies. I picked a cement floor tile of navy and gray plaid, had the paper custom-matched to it, and then papered the hall just outside it with my favorite Schumacher print of completely nuts-o Tibetan tigers. Because my clients never let me have that much fun.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The other layout updates were upstairs, where we turned a kitchen into the master bathroom and closet of my dreams. The new shower is about the size of the studio I lived in during grad school. The tiles in there were my biggest splurge, with a pretty &#8217;40s-inspired white and blue marble floor and cornflower blue walls with period-appropriate black tile trim. In fact, I used a thread of either blue or orange throughout the whole house, which helped tie together my otherwise colorful selections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upstairs had the same arched niche which we again punched through for flow, and stole some closet space to create a linen closet in the hall. We repurposed original doors, which have amazing Deco knobs and backplates. The original bath’s odd standing shower became a washer-dryer unit.</p>

<p>Our son’s bathroom, beyond losing its shower to the washer-dryer, kept its layout with cosmetic updates only. I found a cornflower blue penny round for the floor, with family-friendly gray grout that hides the dirt, and paired it with white subway tile and a cobalt blue bullnose tile. The black vanity is made to look like a repurposed dresser, but it is actually a sneaky Restoration Hardware reproduction that matches the one in the master bath. My favorite touch is the shower, with its pretty vintage-style handheld showerhead and its huge oversized rain head.</p>

<p>Our son&#8217;s nursery was the room I was most itching to decorate as the renovation finished. The dresser is vintage, and I made blinds by cannibalizing a Home Depot shade with a Spoonflower fabric of wonderful tigers, to whom we now bid goodnight in our bedtime routine. The mobile was a gift from his grandmother, from an artist she knows in Brooklyn whose Etsy shop (AllySen) sells similar creations. Lucy Goosey, the giant plastic goose nightlight, is a particular favorite and another gift from family. We tried to scatter family throughout the room, from photos and cards to the quilt hanging above the crib, made for my husband when he was born. I was a very happy camper when that room was finished before our son, Mac, arrived!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As for other original details, we tried to reuse a few light fixtures, but only one held up to re-wiring. The rest were mostly purchased from Schoolhouse Electric and Y Lighting. The floors were refinished with a wonderful no-VOC satin-finish natural oil product called Rubio Monocoat, which everyone loves when they visit. And my contractor and the crew thought I was crazy to replicate the original black windows with their traditional mullions, but they fit the Tudor style of the house perfectly, and I was adamant. Luckily, the guys all changed their minds when they were installed and stained. Or they were polite enough to pretend.</p>
<p>Throughout the project—completed on-budget and on-time, a minor miracle—I was so happy to see the crew every morning. I do NOT recommend living in the basement during a renovation unless you know exactly what you’re getting into, but it was our only option, and the crew was wonderful. It also made meetings a breeze, as I would pop upstairs on my way to work, discussing any questions that had arisen the day before. The crew&#8217;s foreman was reliable in every way, particularly for solving problems intelligently and with an eye for design. He is worth his weight in gold.</p>
<p>In the end, we made our deadline, but more importantly, we made the home I had hoped for. I used to stand in the half-framed kitchen, imagining our little boy padding around the loop made by our newly-opened doorways. Sure enough, every night Mac does his laps, chasing the cats and toppling over onto floors that the team patched and sanded and made to look like they have always been this way. We love our old stove, although the left burners have to be lit with a match. We love our neighbors, and the stories they tell of all the families who have come through over the years. We made this old home new again, and for that, I am deeply grateful to Sweeten and our Sweeten contractor and all the rest.</p>

<p>We continue to putter with smaller projects: painting the garage door, glamming up the entry with our practical and beautiful Shoe-seum (I am slowly being edged out by my husband’s sneakers). Perhaps if we ever manage to tackle the backyard, we will have another Sweeten post for the scary concrete underground wine cellar that turns everything into mildew. But for now, we are enjoying our small projects after the big project was handled by the pros.</p>

<em>Guest post by Jenna, Chelsea homeowner</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We purchased our three-bedroom, two-bath home in Chelsea in 2008. At first, we painted and got rid of the popcorn ceiling but otherwise had a long, outstanding list of items to complete after our initial move in. My husband and I were expecting our first child six years later and thought: what better time to renovate a home than a few months before the baby is due! We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our contractor</a>. Upon our first meeting, it was clear that he was willing to indulge my creative side and workshop out-of-the-box ideas along the way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was eager to modernize and lighten the home. Over the years, I lost patience with the worn parquet maple floor and the mismatched color palette in the kitchen. Every surface in the home needed a facelift. And with a baby on the way, we had the very immediate challenge of creating a nursery and guest bedroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19146 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_jenna_apartment-before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19145" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" alt="sweeten_jenna_apartment-before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, we replaced the countertops, floors, cabinet doors, and backsplash. My goal was to create a soft, clean space—bringing in details like a slate floor and light gray marble backsplash to complement the natural floor tiles. I added agate and stone knobs on the cabinets and drawers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m in the process of creating a &#8220;bucket list&#8221; installation for the remaining wall, though I&#8217;m enjoying the space the empty wall creates. I went with an all-white countertop with no veins as I simply couldn’t find a slab that I was excited about in my price range. Everything, even the natural granite, looked man-made.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted to feel like I was in a luxurious hotel bathroom when I was at home, so I opted for softer lighting and intricate tile work in both bathrooms. I hate seeing soap bottles from outside a shower, so our contractor’s team embedded four shelves into the wall along the shower structure. I purchased the sink base from IKEA but had custom marble tops made and chose sconces over harsh bathroom lighting.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Gray floors are obviously in, but mostly because they substantially soften the weight of a room. In fact, it’s the first thing people notice when they see the ‘before and after’. We added taller baseboards which also add height to each room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We re-carpeted the two bedrooms on the lower level, white shag in the baby’s room as I knew lots of people would be hanging out on the floor with the baby, and white patterned carpet everywhere else. My friends with kids told me I was crazy for choosing white but so far the baby has accommodated the need to keep it clean!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The baby’s room needed to be cozy, magical, and PRACTICAL. The tree that hovers over the baby’s crib is made of the tree trunks from the four posts of the huppah at our wedding. I’ve created and commissioned a series of dream catchers that float among the branches (not over the crib!) from treasures I’ve collected all over the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was very grateful to our contractor for helping in the final details of the nursery—his team secured some elements of the changing table and helped hang some of the complicated wall hangings that I insisted on having.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In most renovations, a lengthy list of materials, fixtures, finishes, and features separates the before from the after. This is not one of those renovations. With little more than fresh paint, new floors, and just a few weeks to go before a move-in deadline, Claudia and Alejandro came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to create a modern and bright three-bedroom condo in Boerum Hill &#8211; a clean slate for this Brooklyn family and their toddler, Luciano. Their secret sauce? Claudia brought her <a href="https://www.aftertheweddingmiami.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filmmaker</a>&#8216;s eye to every detail, looking for ways to capture natural light and find just the right shades of white for each room. Luciano&#8217;s room is first up, but we&#8217;ll get back to this stately neighborhood when Luciano&#8217;s parents are ready to reveal their living room after move-in!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/claudia-and-alejandros-boerum-hill-condo-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13141 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ClaudiaNursery-00-COVER.png" alt="SWEETEN_ClaudiaNursery-00-COVER" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ClaudiaNursery-00-COVER.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ClaudiaNursery-00-COVER-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sweeten did a really great job of helping us take this on when we needed a little hand-holding. Gennadiy and his team were really efficient and got the work done in less than a month.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><em>&#8211; Claudia, Boerum Hill homeowner</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This family of three found their new home after living in a smaller place in the same neighborhood. They loved the location and the oversized windows, but knew the place needed some work before move-in. The apartment had not been updated since the 1980s and had an odd mix of original woodwork (big plus) and yellow walls (big minus). Fresh paint was an obvious and easy move, but Claudia also saw the opportunity to unify and lighten the rooms with new flooring and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3527" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a project on Sweeten</a> looking for a contractor who could handle relatively cosmetic changes on an aggressive, one month timeline. We matched the family with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Gennadiy</a> as Claudia put together her astonishingly short and sweet list of material picks<span id="more-13133"></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13142 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/claudia-before-living.png" alt="claudia before living" width="600" height="374" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/claudia-before-living.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/claudia-before-living-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13143" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/claudia-before-bedroom.png" alt="claudia before bedroom" width="600" height="374" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/claudia-before-bedroom.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/claudia-before-bedroom-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claudia&#8217;s work in the film industry led her to focus on ways to play up the natural light in each room, but natural light works in mysterious ways: north and south-facing windows let in different tones of white and yellow light. Tuned into the exposures in each room and the subtle undertones in various shades of paint, Claudia sampled dozens of different whites on each wall, looking for just the right tone in each space. She found that some whites had blueish undertones while others had more yellow bases, and wanted to avoid going too far in either direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In their son&#8217;s south-facing room, the couple chose <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/redirects/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=oc-17&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Moore White Dove</a> &#8211; a soft, warm white. In the north-facing living room, Benjamin Moore <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/redirects/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=oc-117&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simply White</a> felt right &#8212; Claudia saw a modern, true white that still felt soft in a room that doesn&#8217;t get direct light. Ceilings, molding details, and doors throughout the apartment all got a smooth coat of Simply White for a crisp, clean, and neutral finish.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Claudia continued her expert focus on natural light with new hardwood floors in a light finish. The family&#8217;s move-in timeline necessitated finding flooring with a short lead time, ruling out a number of Canadian and European vendors. Claudia found low gloss, wide-plank oak flooring from Armstrong in <a href="https://www.armstrong.com/flooring/hardwood/mystic-taupe-oak-5-in-solid-hardwood-wide-plank-APK5432LG/floor-139919.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mystic Taupe</a> and Gennadiy&#8217;s team handled the installation throughout the 1,000 square foot condo. In the nursery, Gennadiy installed a <a href="https://lightingbygregory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drum pendant light</a> with a fabric shade. Claudia reports that Luciano loves his new digs!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We caught Claudia and her family just weeks after move-in, so we&#8217;ll have to do a second visit after everything is unpacked to see how the new living room is coming together. In the meantime, one last look at Claudia&#8217;s simple magic &#8211; plants and vibrant color surround the living room&#8217;s original mantle and keep the focus on oversize windows and the season&#8217;s light. So many thanks to this stylish family for our first peek at a simple and smart renovation! We can&#8217;t wait to see what you all do next in your beautiful home.</p>
