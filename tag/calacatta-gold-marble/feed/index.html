										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b></b><b></b>A hex tile bathroom provides a new look, plus a West Elm side table moonlights as a vanity</h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, we took a peek at Amy and Nick’s sparkling new <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a>. This week, we’re exploring their new bathroom, which takes a style cue from a previous Sweeten story.</span></i></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="black-hex-tile-bathroom"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49234 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Amy-BathKitchen-04.jpg" alt="White bathroom with black hex tile along with sink and vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span> Refresh an outdated bath in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: After purchasing their 2-bed, 1-bath condo, it became clear to Amy and Nick that the old bathroom needed to be given new life. The layout worked, but the tile and fixtures were tired and out-of-style, and a low ceiling made the space feel cramped.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who had successfully renovated their kitchen (and who they’d found on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with general contractors after </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posting their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) got to work on the bathroom remodel. The layout was preserved but the footprint was expanded; one wall was moved and the ceiling was raised to make the space feel larger. The old tile was ripped up and replaced with a hex tile bathroom floor paired with high-contrast white grout. White subway tile was installed in the shower, along the side of the tub, and across the lower half of the walls. All new fixtures in polished chrome gave the space a bright boost. A new sink and vanity with a Calacatta gold <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble</a> countertop was placed center stage (the marble was also added to the windowsill and threshold), while a wall-mounted faucet provides a sleek, contemporary look. It took a couple of tries for Amy and Nick to find the right <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilet</a> that would work with their piping; Amy explained, &#8220;W</span>e knew from the beginning we needed a horizontal connection—just not all the horizontally piped toilets we bought worked for our specific connection. Eventually, we just had our contractor pick one out for us and switched the handle so it was more in line aesthetically with what we&#8217;d originally picked out.&#8221; A large, recessed medicine cabinet was added above the sink in addition to customized storage; &#8220;I like the two built-in nooks (in the shower)—it makes it easy to separate bath products by person and height. We&#8217;re also both really pleased with the way the side table/vanity turned out,&#8221; said Amy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The vanity was fashioned from a West Elm side table customized to fit a countertop and pedestal sink. Amy was inspired by Sweeten homeowners </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-ellen-bens-brooklyn-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen and Ben</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who created their own custom vanity in a similar way.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Hex floor tile in a matte finish: </span><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Merola-Tile-Metro-Hex-2-in-Matte-11-1-8-in-x12-5-8-in-Black-Porcelain-Mosaic-9-64-sq-ft-case-FXLM2HMB/203684370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home Depot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Brooklyn couple who loves to cook creates a waterfall counter as a welcoming perch for friends and family</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-26527" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-07" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project</span>: Open up a tiny kitchen in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: Amy and Nick were looking for a new home and wanted a place that was either move-in ready or didn’t need a lot of work. Things changed when they came across a 2-bed, 1-bath condo in Prospect Heights that had a layout that made perfect sense but needed a complete overhaul, so they decided to buy it and put aside money to make the space their own. The kitchen was outdated and enclosed in a small, triangular-shaped nook in the main living area, while the fridge was awkwardly placed outside of it. Because of the narrow shape of the kitchen, there was limited counter space and no room for lower cabinets. Also, the tile floor in the kitchen didn’t match the wood floor that ran throughout the rest of the living area, a look that made the space feel disjointed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>: To kick things off, the couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on Sweeten and were matched with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. The gut renovation began with demolishing the walls that made up the triangular nook to make way for a new layout in the kitchen. All of the old molding throughout the apartment was removed and replaced with crisp new trim. The entire apartment was also skim coated—walls, ceilings, doors, and moldings—and given a fresh coat of paint. Moving the sink meant checking under the floorboards to see if the support beams would allow piping to run in the direction needed to relocate it. Most of the support beams ran in the opposite direction, but luckily they switched direction under the kitchen area, allowing Amy and Nick to install the new sink as planned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall counter</a> on the island was fabricated in Calacatta gold marble and continued along the rest of the kitchen prep areas. Amy explained, &#8220;We wanted the kitchen island to be a centerpiece of the room, and we were looking for a surface that was beautiful to fill the space. The Calacatta gold marble slab we chose was the first slab we saw at the stone yard, and we just loved the contrasting veins and its uniqueness. The inspiration for the waterfall was that we wanted to take full advantage of all the beautiful material we had. We also used the leftover marble for the bathroom—it&#8217;s in the vanity, the windowsill, and the threshold.&#8221; The marble also has a honed surface, rather than polished, which helps with wear and tear. To complement the marble waterfall counter and countertops, a large, white elongated <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hex tile</a> was chosen for the backsplash. Storage was added in the form of pre-fab upper and lower cabinets with a glossy, acrylic finish to replace the original wood cabinetry, complete with a custom-made pantry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All new Bosch appliances—dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, cooktop, vent hood, and microwave—provided a much-needed functional upgrade. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pendant lighting</a> was added over the island and recessed lighting was installed throughout the kitchen and the rest of the living area to brighten up the space. And if you’re wondering how Amy and Nick feel about the results, just ask Amy. &#8220;We use the kitchen and joint living spaces for relaxing, cooking, and entertaining. The room has all the things that make us happy.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Amy found the backsplash tile on Pinterest and searched online for it everywhere until she came across the manufacturer, Pratt &amp; Larson.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Style finds</span>: Backsplash tile: Pratt &amp; Larson. Dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, cooktop, vent hood, and microwave: <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a>.

<p>In <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-remodel-breaks-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily&#8217;s kitchen</a>, moving the sink to the peninsula not only added some breathing space, it allowed her to extend the length of her cabinets without worrying about having enough clearance below them for washing up.</p>
