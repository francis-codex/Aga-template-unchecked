			<h2>The shower bench: A bathroom detail to add for relaxation and functionality</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04.jpg" alt="two-tone-bathroom-with-glass-shower" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52329" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The bathroom remodel holds second place as the most popular project in the home. (The kitchen is the most popular.) While choices for tile, layout, and storage are usually top-of-mind, adding details like a shower bench can also make a big impact.</p>
<p>For many, shower benches are a nice add-on as they provide both form and function. They can help people with mobility challenges. Provide a special place for relaxation. Add a unique design perspective to the room. Or, all of the above. Here, five shower bench designs from Sweeten renovations show the comfort of taking a seat.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/category/sweeten-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten </a>matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Eye-catching wraparound shower bench seating</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="bathroom wet room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24574" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-07-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>One way to make a statement is with a long shower bench that wraps around the area. It gives the space an almost spa-like feel. This Sweeten homeowner took it even a step further. She elevated the design by adding in under-mounted lights. This larger-sized bench allows for extra storage as well. This <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner</a> keeps a handy shower caddy at the ready. But others have been known to use it as a way to add interesting accents, like candles or even plants.</p>
<h3>A pulldown shower bench with a purpose</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="foldable-wooden-seat-bathroom"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Debbie-Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="foldable wooden seat in bathroom with white wall tiles and grab bars along with glass shower door with long handle after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49463" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Debbie-Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Debbie-Bathroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Debbie-Bathroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Sometimes you just don’t have enough room to add a built-in shower bench. Don&#8217;t worry: you still have options! Smaller spaces can accommodate drop-down shower bench seats. These are great additions if you have mobility challenges (for example, for recent injuries or are elderly). They provide a safe spot to steady yourself or take a rest. This <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/remodeled-bathroom-for-elderly-father-is-safe-stylish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten renovation</a> combined two crowded bathrooms to create a larger, more accessible one for a father&#8217;s limited mobility. Now, his wheelchair and walker can fit and move with ease. The shower needed to be safe and comfortable with a shower bench and grab bar. Mission accomplished!</p>
<h3>A luxuriously long bench</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="shower-with-bench-and-recessed-shelves" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-02.jpg" alt="walk-in shower with bench and marble tiles on walls and recessed shelves and glass door after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47475" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>If you do have the space, consider putting in a long shower bench—one that runs the length of your shower. This is a luxurious addition to any bathroom design. It will provide you with space for a basket of shower accessories. Or, just use it as a place to sit and relax as you enjoy the steam of a hot shower. Like the wraparound bench, it provides a visually appealing design element to the space. This <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/two-bathroom-renovation-for-resale-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner</a> updated her bathrooms with resale in mind and felt that this added feature would be a draw.</p>
<h3>A versatile freestanding shower bench</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="frameless-glass-sliding-doors-walk-in-shower" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath05.jpg" alt="frameless glass sliding doors to a walk in shower with steel bathroom fittings and open shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31704" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For Sweeten homeowners, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-co-op-reno-designed-to-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olivia and Greg</a>, it was the upcoming birth of their first child that sparked a remodel. They wanted an overall update to their prewar co-op and to be more versatile. Olivia pictured a bathroom that would be a place she could retreat to. “We wanted something that looked good, but was also functional so that I could shave my legs and relax during a hot shower,” Olivia said.</p>
<h3>A functional floating bench</h3>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04.jpg" alt="two-tone-bathroom-with-glass-shower" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52329" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The aesthetic of a floating shower bench is streamlined but functions like all other shower benches. When installed properly (it is important to hire an expert contractor for the project!) a floating shower bench can hold up to 400lbs. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/before-after-meghas-midtown-kitchen-and-bath-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner Megha</a> added this feature to her bath without using up a lot of space. Since it is open underneath, she could store toiletries and other necessities.</p>

<p class="p2">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Ylia + André&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/fixer-upper-washington-heights-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tub-to-shower conversion</a></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Deciding whether to convert a bathtub into a shower</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bathtubs have their place, but most of us take many more showers than baths. So why were most bathrooms outfitted with a bathtub rather than a walk-in shower over the last few decades? The simplest answer is flexibility. You can take a shower in a bathtub, but not vice-versa. Also, families with children do well with a bathtub, and they’re useful for bathing dogs. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, stepping over the tub rail every time you shower is not ideal, and is not possible for many people. If you&#8217;re ready for a change, this guide by Sweeten lays out how to convert a bathtub to a shower (luckily, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward!)</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Showers are ideal for aging and multi-generational families</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Converting a bathtub into a shower has become much more common as our population ages, aided by the increasing popularity of accessible and<a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> universal design</a>. These design concepts are aligned with the Americans with Disabilities Act and include features such as entry ramps in place of stairs, rocker-style light switches, and lever-style door handles in place of knobs. The magic of this approach, even when not mandated, is obvious with multigenerational families, or when you find yourself with an injury or chronic health condition. These thoughtful home designs can accommodate your needs however they may change.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a bathroom remodel, the shower can use a curbless entrance that doesn’t impede a wheelchair user. (Another benefit of the curbless design is its streamlined, modern look!) Another popular feature y</span><span class="s1">ou can specify is a built-in or removable bench. Even better, there is a multitude of design and hardware options to add these elements.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="light-tiled-bathroom-with-mirror" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19.jpg" alt="light tiled bathroom with large mirror and shower glass for walk in shower area after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-35033 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p2">(<em>Above</em>) A Sweeten remodel for an <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-grandparents-renovate-kensington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accessible bathroom</a></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Figure out if a shower will work for you</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Before ordering materials and fixtures, <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post your project</a> on Sweeten and discuss with your contractor whether your desired shower size will fit in your space. </span><span class="s1">Create an overall plan that includes the finished size of the shower, location of existing or desired windows, lighting, exhaust fan, and the condition and location of existing plumbing. If the shower drain stays in the same location, the connection is simple and fast. If the drain must be moved, you’ll see the cost rise, depending on how extensive the work is. Items like the faucet and showerhead will come in later. </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Materials for converting a shower</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the shower unit itself, you can choose a good-quality pre-formed pan and walls, but high-quality tiled pans and walls have become prevalent and usually have a better “feel.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom tiles</a> are also one of, if not the most, powerful <span class="s3">aesthetic statements in the room</span>. This is where you can really get creative. Ceramic, glass, stone, and even metal tiles are available in any color, multiple textures, and finishes. You can truly have any look you love with tiles, and apart from normal cleaning and sealing, their maintenance is low.</span></p>
<h3>Costs to convert a bathtub to a shower</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Costs to convert a bathtub into a shower are usually quite reasonable. If you’re starting with a bathroom that’s in good condition, you can plan for $1,500 or so for a quick and basic conversion. If you upgrade to a tile pan and walls, you’ll be looking at $3,000 and up. These figures are for standard materials. However, when you make changes to the room size, or add windows that require new framing, your costs will increase. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-and-brown-bathroom-with-floating-vanity" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Apt-13.jpg" alt="White and brown bathroom with floating vanity and shower curtain after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-51551 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h4>Costs for faucets and showerheads</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Faucets and showerheads are available in countless styles and finishes, and you’re probably aware of rainfall showerheads. Full-body jets are another popular and luxurious feature, but definitely are considered an extra. Good faucets will cost $100 and up and they’re worth every penny.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One item you mustn’t overlook is the shower door system. You’ll find clear glass, frosted glass, and so on, but the aesthetics are less important than the quality. Like the shower pan, the door keeps the water where it belongs and should seal completely. A tiny leak, unnoticed for five years, is a disaster in the making. Fortunately, you can prevent this scenario easily with a high-quality door system installed by your contractor. A good unit will cost you $500 and up, depending on the size you need.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">A remodeling team to guide your bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just like kitchens, bathroom remodels can be more complex than other rooms. This is due to their heavy, daily usage and the requirement for more fixtures in a small space. Toilet, sink, shower, and storage all have to be integrated into one of the smallest rooms in the house. That’s where interior designers and general contractors shine. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find the right general contractor</a> to help you navigate these decisions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><i>A note on fixture and appliance deliveries</i>: If you’re on a tight timeline, <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100545793-15162279"><span class="s1">Appliances Connection</span></a> has over 50,000 items in stock and ready to ship nationally. If you’re in the NY/NJ metro area, in-stock items typically deliver within 2-3 days.</p>

<h3>Finding the right time to renovate</h3>
<p>We’ve all walked into homes where two different sets of ideas are in play. This renovation was part of a quest for cohesion. We’d established an aesthetic when we’d updated the kitchen two years before, and we were now putting in a bathroom and closet we could love. The old set of ideas included a showerhead on the long side of the bathtub and pitch-dark storage spaces. We were not sad to see them go.</p>
<div></div>

<p>We are Kate, a creative director for a women’s wellness startup, Max, a data analyst at a tech firm, and Lenny, a female Pitbull/Rat Terrier mix. We live in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in a 1926 co-op building. We’re first-time homeowners of a 610-square-foot one-bedroom apartment. We purchased in January 2016 as first-time buyers. We didn’t change the place until 2019 when we renovated the kitchen.</p>
<p>We planned to wait to continue renovating, but the combination of being home due to Covid-19 and having few opportunities to spend money meant that we wanted a nicer place and we accelerated our savings plan. We decided to go for it this year and renovate the bathroom and our closet as a single project.</p>
<h3>Swapping out the tub for a shower</h3>
<p>Remodeling the 35-square-foot bathroom was a style choice, but also one of function. In the existing room, neither the floor nor the walls were level. We hated that the shower head was in the middle of the wall on the tub’s long side. We wanted a modern stand-up shower with a glass door instead of the step-in tub and wraparound shower curtain. The closet redo made sense to tack on because of its proximity to the bathroom. We wanted to combine two small adjacent closets—one accessible from the bedroom, the other from the hallway—into a single large one. Neither closet had electrical wiring, so finding our things was a challenge. We knew we could net more storage if we merged them into one large closet.</p>

<blockquote><p>
This was easily the most challenging phase of the project, since we’d left Brooklyn on a road trip and were far away when the contractor discovered the problem. We didn’t need to worry.
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Creating a whole new bathroom layout</h3>
<p>We started in the bathroom. We rearranged the whole bathroom, so this was not a simple “rip and replace.” Moving the shower to the back wall meant relocating the toilet and reconfiguring the plumbing proved necessary. Our biggest questions were about the unknowns. In a nutshell, here’s what we learned: You can’t prepare for what’s behind a wall or under the floor. You carry out the demolition and hope to get lucky.</p>
<p>We’d decided we wanted white subway tile with a dark gray grout on the walls. The floor tiles had a distressed texture in dark gray. The vanity’s light wood finish matches our kitchen cabinets, and it offers tons of storage even though it’s only a 24-inch unit. The toilet search was more challenging than expected since we had specific size requirements, but eventually, we found one we liked.</p>
<h3>The contractor handles the discovery under the subfloor</h3>
<p>We’d heard plenty of nightmares about people moving plumbing in New York City bathrooms and hoped our fate might be different, but it wasn’t. Having completed most of the demolition, the contractors lifted the floor tile. Beneath the visible layer, they discovered two additional layers of tile. Once the subfloor was exposed, it was clear it had been compromised, both by years of trapped moisture and the weight of those three tile layers.</p>

<p>The co-op&#8217;s engineer brought onsite recommended pouring a new concrete slab, which added expense and impacted our schedule. This was easily the most challenging phase of the project since we’d left Brooklyn on a road trip and were far away when the contractor discovered the problem. We didn’t need to worry. Our contractor worked with the building’s engineer to pour the new slab to the required specifications.</p>
<h3>Smooth communication with their contractor</h3>
<p>Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors provided us with updates via an online project-management tool that <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped with communication throughout the job</a>. The team used the tool to share photo and video updates. It helped to keep everyone in sync and organized. That platform really streamlined the conversation regarding every aspect of the job. The bathroom came together exactly as we’d hoped. We’re thrilled with the new storage, including an inset bottle nook in the shower. And the rain showerhead combined with our building’s incredible water pressure makes for an immersive experience every morning.</p>
<h3>Combining closets for a larger one</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-remodel-your-closet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded bedroom closet</a> came next. The contractors removed the wall separating the two smaller closets in order to merge them; we kept the door on the bedroom side. I love being able to see things in the closet, thanks to the increased space, and the addition of wiring let us install good lighting. For the shelving, we took a hybrid approach, buying all of the parts separately. The white shelves are typical closet shelves, but the racks are meant for garage storage. We can finally find our clothes!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="custom-walk-in-closet-with-track-lights" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="small walk-in closet with door and hardwood floors and track lights after renovation" width="800" height="1200" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51189" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-11.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="walk-in-closet-with-shelves" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="small custom walk-in closet storage with shelves after renovation" width="800" height="1200" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51190" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>This closet hack would also mean addressing the hallway with trim and paint. On that side, the contractors closed the door opening and painted the wall, where we later created a gallery wall for art and photos. The previous door trim was missing chunks of wood (likely from people moving big objects in/out of rooms and banging into the door frame.) It had also been painted a million times and was generally an eyesore. We knew replacing the door and window trim would go a long way towards refreshing the space. The red light fixture provides a nice pop of color.</p>

<h3>Their Sweeten contractors: the right renovation partners</h3>
<p>This was a much larger project than we thought we’d be taking on this year, but it worked out beautifully. Our Sweeten contractors were transparent about billing, supplying us with perfectly itemized invoices. They were terrific problem solvers, with elegant design sense and ideas that enhanced our final results. We love our new apartment!</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Max and Kate, for sharing your bathroom and closet renovation with us!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Adding color to a bathroom<span>—in small accents or large splashes—</span>can have a big design impact</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47686 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bathroom-Pop-Color.jpg" alt="color ideas for bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bathroom-Pop-Color.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bathroom-Pop-Color-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Adding colorful accents to your bathroom when you renovate is a good way to show your own style and personality. These colorful accents can be in the form of vanities, wall paint, and tile.  By selecting your favorite hue and incorporating it into your next bathroom remodel, you can effectively create any mood/vibe you like.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how some Sweeten renovators incorporated colorways outside of neutral making a trip to the bathroom a happy event.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Bold in blue bathrooms</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40139" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-12.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-12-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-12-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Blue comes in all shades, making it a good color choice to accommodate many design styles. Sweeten renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-bedroom-conversion-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katherine and Chris</a> needed more space for their growing family. They found a promising two-bedroom in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that they could transform with the help of a Sweeten contractor. Their contractor overhauled the bathroom and the couple decided to add a splash of color with a dramatic blue vanity and storage closet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43251" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mauricio-bathroom-06.jpg" alt="shower tile" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mauricio-bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mauricio-bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mauricio-bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mauricio-bathroom-06-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For their 1,800-square-foot full apartment renovation, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/full-apartment-renovation-smooths-out-traffic-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dara and Mauricio</a> posted their project scope to Sweeten and found a contractor to update their bathroom. &#8220;In terms of style, we tried to reach a middle ground between our preferences,&#8221; says Mauricio. &#8220;I chose a more eclectic style for the second bathroom: gray-and-blue patterned tiles on the floor and shower wall mixed with large white subway tiles.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="powder-blue-vanity-white-farmhouse-sink" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44229" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Peggy-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="powder blue vanity with white farmhouse sink and large frameless vanity mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Peggy-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Peggy-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Peggy-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-historic-brownstone-bath-remodel-stays-true-to-its-roots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peggy and her husband</a> also found themselves in a similar situation in that they couldn&#8217;t put off a renovation any longer. Except for this couple, there wasn&#8217;t a new baby on the way: the bathroom was leaky and in bad need of repair. They wanted to stay true to the feel of their circa late-1800s brownstone, so Peggy selected classic design elements, including a blue vanity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-door-with-knob-to-white-bathroom" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49090" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="White door with knob opening to white bathroom with blue penny tiles with white vanity and white tub after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>When Kate and Daniel redid their bathroom, they went spent a lot of time researching different styles online and on social media. They went with <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-popular-bath-tiles-and-how-much-they-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">classic subway tile</a> for the walls and hexagonal tile in a royal blue colorway for the floor.</p>
<h3>Greens with envy</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44452" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Gus-Apt-09.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Gus-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Gus-Apt-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Gus-Apt-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With so <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/room-decorating/bathrooms/g756/colorful-bathrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many different shades of green</a> to choose from, it is no wonder so many renovators are finding it easy to pick the one that suits their style. Brooklyn residents <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/green-bath-renovation-ditmas-park-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gus and Katherine</a> (<em>above</em>) used a clever mix of tiles for their bathroom remodel, which includes a herringbone ceramic in Jadite for a statement wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="green-hex-tiles-sunburst-pattern" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48509" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-09.jpg" alt="Green hex tiles with sunburst pattern double floating vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="1501" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Fellow Sweeten renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kavi and David</a> also selected an unconventional tile for their bathroom renovation. They replaced a subdued floor with a cement Dandelion tile in Lawn/Milk. These hex tiles with watercolor edges and abstract white lines depict sunburst.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="sea-green-shower-wall-tiles" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40914" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-07.jpg" alt="walk-in shower with recessed shelf and sea green tiles on wall and brushed gold shower head and fixtures after renovation" width="1000" height="1475" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-07-203x300.jpg 203w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-07-600x885.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-07-585x863.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/eclectic-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Allyson,</a> an attorney who purchased a 1920s home in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, also used green to make a design statement in her bath. “I really wanted my bathroom to reflect my love of travel and combine vintage and mid-century modern elements,&#8221; says Allyson. Her Sweeten contractor installed shower tiles in a rich aqua green that features a windblown texture—the idea behind them was to make you feel like you&#8217;re surrounded by water.</p>
<h3>Orange is the new black</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35491" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08.jpg" alt="wallpaper, bathroom, home, design, renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/mid-century-mad-men-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">These Brooklyn homeowners</a> turned to a Sweeten contractor to remodel their apartment that hadn&#8217;t been updated since the 1980s. A black color scheme was chosen with a pop of color in the flooring tile. They installed black tile on the wall by the sink, and offset it with a geometric tile on the floor in burnt orange.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/an-l-a-bath-remodel-reveals-wet-room-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48285" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/77981-Liz-Bath-09.jpg" alt="women general contractors" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/77981-Liz-Bath-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/77981-Liz-Bath-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/77981-Liz-Bath-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Liz and Kevin</a>, residents of Los Angeles, were thrilled with finding a home in SoCal. The catch? The 1923 house had water damage that required the bathroom to be gutted. With the help of a Sweeten contractor, they were able to transform the space into a modern oasis. They took a chance and added a striking backsplash to the sink area. “The orange,” Liz said, “felt like a risk, but a little playful, like us.”</span></p>
<h3>Back in black</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44041" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-6.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-6.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Veronica-bathroom-6-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Today, a lot of home design blogs are touting &#8220;blue is the new black&#8221; or &#8220;yellow is the new black.&#8221; But rest assured black is back—and here to stay. Look no further than Sweeten renovator <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-bath-refresh-from-leaky-to-luxe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Veronica&#8217;s bathroom remodel</a>. She worked with a Sweeten contractor to update her entire bath after she found a leaky pipe in her Manhattan co-op. She was happy to get rid of the outdated beige tile and old jet tub and replace them with more chic options. By painting the walls black, it lends a modern aesthetic to the room. “The bathroom got very little light to begin with, so I decided to embrace the cave-like atmosphere and go dark,” Veronica says.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27231" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />When <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alicia and Ed</a> got a new dog, Roxy, they realized they wanted a pet-friendly neighborhood. They found a 1,400-square-foot brownstone in Brooklyn but it needed to be renovated. The bathroom had broken tiles and much of the space was outdated and in need of repair. For the guest bathroom, the couple selected a black-and-white color palette. The result is a classic yet sleek aesthetic.</p>

All of the walls and the flooring are sealed against water, just like the surfaces in a typical shower stall. </span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">The main flooring of the wet room is on the same level as the shower floor. The section of the wet room where the shower is located has a floor with a sharp slope to aid with water drainage. The rest of the bathroom floor is sloped toward the same drain. But the floor slope is more gradual.</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Because there is so much water, bathroom facilities such as the toilet and sink are either raised or are water-sealed.</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Due to how wet rooms work, the function of the room is prioritized over the style. Subsequently, most wet room design is clean and spare.</span></p><h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Why are wet rooms so popular?</span></h3><ul><li class="p3"><span class="s1">Frameless showers let in more light. These use sheets of thick, unframed glass to surround the shower in a wet room. They make</span><span class="s1"> the whole room lighter and airier. </span></li><li class="p3"><span class="s1">Since wet rooms are designed with excellent ventilation, they typically see less mold and mildew growth.</span></li><li class="p3"><span class="s1">Wet rooms are much easier to clean.

Or you can add a half-wall to minimize splashing.</span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Bathroom storage</b>: Locating storage and linen cabinets outside of the bathroom is one way to deal with moisture.

Yet a professionally installed wet room is no different than locating a freestanding shower on an upper floor. The waterproofing methods are the same—just on a larger scale. Be aware that just like with any bathroom, a wet room could eventually spring a leak and require maintenance.</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Wet room floors are easy to clean. You can clean the flooring with a mild floor cleaner and a rubber-bladed mop. Start on the far end of the room and push water toward the shower drain. You can also use a hand-held shower head as a hose.  </span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Walls in regular bathrooms can be difficult to clean, especially when they&#8217;re made of drywall or plaster. Wet room walls are hardscaped and water-sealed. So, you can clean them with soap and water without fear of damage.</span></p><p class="p1"><i>A note on fixture and appliance deliveries</i>: If you’re on a tight timeline, <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100545793-15162279"><span class="s1">Appliances Connection</span></a> has over 50,000 items in stock and ready to ship nationally.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>During COVID-19, certain renovation projects became even more important for homeowners</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44610 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4.jpg" alt="Image of the interior of a renovated Hamptons ranch home" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) A Sweeten homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/southampton-home-renovation-transforms-garage-into-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #76808f;">turns the garage into a living room</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic forced us to take a hard look at our homes. Many were grateful for the security and comfort our homes offered. But many more made note of the features that their homes lacked. At a time when almost half of the workforce was working from home and schools relied on distance learning, renovation projects became top of mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the renovation mindset may be a little different going forward. Jean Brownhill, the founder and CEO of Sweeten discussed the current state of renovation on <em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sweeten-founder-jean-brownhill-on-new-rules-renovation/id1520457603?i=1000504585856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Time</a>,</em> a podcast hosted by <em>Domino</em> editor-in-chief Jessica Romm Perez. One trend they discussed is the emergence of practicality and functionality.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone&#8217;s goal is to make their finished project picture perfect. But to actually live in the space, other things may be more important. Here are some top projects Sweeten saw grow in popularity over the last year.</span></p>
<h3>Top COVID-19 renovation projects</h3>
<h4>Creating new living areas</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With people spending so much time at home, they adapted their living spaces to new uses. Many people upgraded their outdoor living areas by adding outdoor kitchens and other living spaces. Also, it wasn&#8217;t clear if a vacation away would be possible, so outdoor living space became more important. It also makes it possible to socialize with others if indoor entertaining isn’t an option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because health clubs and gyms were closed, many people looked for ways to squeeze a workout space into their living areas. People <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-modern-basement-renovation-produces-a-clean-slate-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adapted spare rooms or unfinished areas</a> like basements to create home gyms. </span></p>
<h4>Kitchen and bathroom remodels still in the spotlight</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchen and bathroom renovations are still popular. Although kitchens have always had many uses, their multitasking ability became more important during the pandemic. Kids often did their remote learning there, and adults used them for makeshift home offices. That&#8217;s in addition to the regular cooking, eating, and cleaning that goes on in a kitchen. The National Kitchen and Bath Association reports that in addition to upgraded appliances, there was an increase in requests for easy-to-clean surfaces, video watching ability, and device charging stations in the cook space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bathrooms became personal sanctuaries more than ever before. After a few weeks that turned into months into the pandemic, people came to value self-care more than ever. Even those who had not considered bath renovations undertook them to improve on their self-care routine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some bath update trends include oversized showers that feature multiple spray heads and body sprays, as well as a steam option. Voice commands can activate preset water temperatures and start music from a personal playlist. Ventilation fans do more than removing moisture: some have LED lighting that helps prevent mold growth. Others feature multi-color lights to change the mood of the room. Many spa-like features can be controlled by smartphones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that most renovations had in common was ease of maintenance. You can renovate a space that looks great, but you have to live in it. &#8220;I think that is one reason why porcelain tiles and planks are so popular,&#8221; said Jean. &#8220;They are easy to clean and they can be made to look like any material. &#8220;</span></p>
<h4>Reworking existing spaces</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, we can relate to how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our work habits. The typical household can get hectic with everyone vying for counter space where they can work, as well as computer time. The problem was frequently solved by setting up work and play areas throughout the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jean mentioned the trend of installing temporary glass panels in the home. These solve the noise problem that happens when someone is on a video call while someone else is unloading the dishwasher, other people are having a conversation, and kids are running around playing. Panels and interior windows give people acoustic separation. &#8220;We’re not looking for visual separation, but what we do want, and need, is acoustic separation,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A closet organizing system that lets you store things neatly and efficiently may be of more use than a room straight out of the pages of a magazine. &#8220;As someone doing a renovation, you don&#8217;t rise to the level of your goals so much as you fall to the level of the systems you put in place,&#8221; said Jean. While we usually want our homes to look fashionable, the emphasis for homes was on function for 2020. </span></p>
<h4>Using unused space</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As floor plans were reconfigured, any unused or underutilized areas became prime real estate. Guest bedrooms became home offices or study lounges. But the real stars were spaces like basements, attics, and garages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attics became playrooms for children. Basements were also used as play areas, but many were converted to home gyms. Some drywall and flooring, and maybe a little weatherproofing, turned these storage areas into useful living spaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some places, such as Los Angeles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people are adding ADUs</a>. An ADU is short for accessory dwelling unit. It is a new living space added to an existing building. Garages are being converted to home offices, but also studio apartments. The apartments can be rented out in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic presents new reasons to think creatively about our living spaces. Although we hope the pandemic will stay a once-in-a-lifetime event, we can all take cues from these COVID-19 renovation projects to inspire our own spaces at home.</span></p>

<h3>Remodel a basement bathroom for a welcome upgrade</h3>
<p>I love my Arlington Ridge neighborhood with its hilly streets and access to the metro, my favorite Mexican restaurant, and grocery store. When I found the 2,000-square-foot 1950s Virginia ranch home, I fell for the windows, cathedral kitchen, glass porch, and spacious yard. My older sister, Missy, deciding to move from San Francisco back to the East Coast, was a perfect excuse to renovate. She asked to use my downstairs as her temporary home.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48731 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="basement bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p>Before we renovated this (almost) windowless basement bathroom, it was creepy and unwelcoming. The shower had a horrible wall partitioning it off from the rest of the room. The door opened to a full view of the toilet. We never used it. I wanted an open-plan bathroom with plenty of light—a room that guests wouldn’t be scared to use when they visited me in Arlington.</p>
<p>I went into this as a first-time renovator. My biggest question was: Will it be a huge interruption in my workday? I work in business development, so I am on Zoom a lot. We posted our project on Sweeten and we could not have been happier with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woman-owned general contractor</a> we selected.</p>
<h3>Behind the not-so-pleasing wall</h3>
<p>When the contractor removed the wall, she discovered a very vintage pipe system that needed replacement. We looked for a plumbing specialist, and that search set us back a couple of days. Meanwhile, our contractor took the room down to the studs so the plumber could install new piping. The job involved breaking the foundation concrete, but even on days when the jackhammers were out or the water had to be turned off, we had advanced warning.</p>
<h3>Expanding the design palette</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48732" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="Arlington bath remodel" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>My Sweeten contractor made the job seamless and easy, even though what I initially envisioned changed dramatically. I thought I wanted the bathroom all white and clean but decided instead to let this room give the downstairs character. When she proposed the sliding glass barn door as a shower enclosure, I was sold.</p>
<p>The vanity is another fantastic piece, not only for its look but for the storage it brought to the room. I never would have guessed I would <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pick the gray shower floor</a>, but it all came together and it works.</p>

<h3>A beautiful result, and a satisfying experience</h3>
<p>I wanted a modern bathroom to match the rest of the house—and my future renovation plans—and I really lucked out. My contractor was really helpful, connecting with my sister and me and providing the right resources and materials. I understood what to expect throughout the process, and we are both so happy with how the bathroom turned out. Missy, a former tech executive, now works as a startup advisor. She is really enjoying the new digs.</p>

<p>Throughout the process, my contractor’s crew was amazing. My one-year-old beagle, Callie, would shake with excitement when they arrived, play for ten minutes, and then allow them to work. She returned throughout the day to check progress and get head scratches.</p>
<p>My Sweeten general contractor answered my questions, updated me on changes, and discussed any challenges. The team was respectful of my space, too. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">covered the downstairs areas</a> to keep them as clean as possible and left the workspace tidy. I scored with a respectful and professional contracting group that made my rip-and-replace renovation run smoothly, even as I worked from home. I always knew what to expect the next day.</p>

<h3>After a remodel, a basement bathroom has real appeal</h3>
<p>Missy’s gorgeous bathroom is now my favorite thing to show off in the house. It inspired her, too. She recently sold her house and is thinking about where she—and her Aussiedoodle, Ellie—should buy next. New, modern, and clean&#8230;what an upgrade.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Deciding to </span><span class="s1">remodel an uncomfortable small bathroom</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We initially looked for a move-in-ready home, but didn&#8217;t find many in our budget in Clarkson where we wanted to live. The bathrooms in our new split-level house were built in 1982. They would need to be remodeled eventually but we’d tackle them as we could afford them. Three ye</span><span class="s2">ars later and with a toddler in our midst, we were ready. The master bathroom would be our first big project.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We had many problems with the original en-suite bathroom. Mainly, it was hideous. I disliked the color scheme on the wall, the warped laminate vanity, and the stick-on floor tiles. Not only was the pattern terrible, but the tiles were coming unglued. The plastic-insert shower was the worst offender. It was small and claustrophobic, and no amount of scrubbing would remove the mold and mildew stains. Even if it was just cleaned, the bathroom still felt dirty. I couldn’t stand showering in there.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">The search for a compatible contractor in Atlanta</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I’d already gotten a few estimates, but we were looking to work with a Black-owned contracting firm and hadn’t found one with availability. In addition, not many contractors want to take on a small space bathroom renovation, not to mention on a minuscule budget. Then I stumbled on a Sweeten blog post featuring <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/support-black-owned-general-contractor-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black-owned general contractors</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted my project</a> on Sweeten and found one that was also a <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woman-owned general contracting firm</a>. I felt really good about her, and she was willing to squeeze us into her schedule.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48164 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-3.jpg" alt="blue bathroom with vanity and toilet" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Finding solutions on a shoestring budget</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As first-time renovators, our biggest question was, “What does a bathroom remodel cost?” We had a limited budget and no idea what was reasonable. Our budget was $5,000, but quickly realized how below the average cost it was. We would have had to cut too many corners. We couldn&#8217;t afford to change the floorplan, so we agreed on the goal of transforming the bathroom into a pleasant, relaxing space. As a result, I decided to save money by designing the bathroom myself and doing it around an existing light fixture.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A crash course in a small bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I started gathering bathroom remodeling ideas on Pinterest and making a vision board. We considered replacing the shower insert to keep costs down, but the contractor said it would just get gross again. I had no idea what went into building and tiling a walk-in shower. First, I found out it costs a lot more to install mosaic subway tile than larger tile. In addition, I learned that a shower floor’s drainage slope requires mosaic tile, and the ones that come in sheets require less labor. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48169 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8.jpg" alt="in-shower storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With so many types of tile out there, we were glad to have the options narrowed for us. We chose large-format ceramic tile for the shower walls and hexagonal mosaic tile for the shower floor—in marble—as I wanted just one aspect to be luxurious. Even with the thoughtful choices, the materials and labor were costly. We gave up replastering the walls, removing the stippling from the ceiling, and installing a recessed light in the shower, all to keep costs down. We even kept the existing toilet, since it was fine.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Coaching and seeking economy</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There were moments when I felt like, “We just can’t afford to do this the right way,” but our Sweeten contractor helped us identify projects we could do ourselves (caulking holes and repairing molding). </span><span class="s1">We chose inexpensive bathroom flooring for the room. An inexpensive vanity helped, and I found the mirror at a discount home store for around $30. Consequently, we saved money and used quality materials where they mattered. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor provided great input and direction—including talking me out of some bad tile choices and kindly suggesting bright, simple colors and patterns. She never took over the vision. She was organized and communicative, and we appreciated her helping us stay (almost) within our revised budget, even after plumbing issues popped up.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48289 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2.jpeg" alt="color in bathroom" width="2048" height="1365" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2.jpeg 2048w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">The final budget—and excellent outcome</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">All told, we more than doubled the original budget (thanks to our family for the generous gift!) coming in just at the starting minimum <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost for a bathroom remodel</a> in Atlanta. This included labor, materials, random plumbing parts, and a zillion trips to Home Depot for the paint and other stuff I did on my own.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The final result feels larger and is the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spa bathroom</a> of my dreams. It’s so serene. My first bathroom with a walk-in shower and a natural stone floor, both of which feel truly luxe. It’s so lovely to step in there now. Everything is well-installed and of good quality. It’s exactly what we hoped for.</span></p>

<h2>In smaller bathrooms, a bathtub to shower conversion saves space</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="tub to shower conversion with double showerheads" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24706" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>This bathroom refresh tops the wishlist</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love walk-in showers, you’re not alone. A larger shower area, easy entry, and a streamlined look make walk-in showers an attractive choice. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to move forward on a bathtub to shower</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conversion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is closely connected to lifestyle. For example, a family with small children may want to keep a bathtub if there is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only one bathroom. Accessibility for limited mobility is another reason.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you&#8217;re already planning an overall bathroom remodel, this is a good time to consider whether swapping the tub for a shower makes sense.</span><span class="s1"> Discuss with your contractor if your desired shower size will fit in your space. </span><span class="s1">For a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-convert-bathtub-into-a-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathtub to shower conversion</a> consider shower size, windows, lighting, exhaust fan, and the condition and location of plumbing. </span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Find inspiration from these Sweeten homeowners who <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/">made the change</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments— for free.</span></p>
<h3>Gaining a more useful shower</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a second bathroom in their Upper East Side co-op, Laura and Randy had to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">maximize their one bath</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They removed the pretty, but impractical, bathtub. And they installed a modern <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk-in shower</a>—with three different shower heads and a seat.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="whie-bathtub-white-pedestal-sink" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-2.jpg" alt="white bathtub with white pedestal sink in a small bathroom with penny tiles before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48154" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A new supercharged shower</span></h3>
<p><span class="s1">Meg and Brett already had a spacious glass shower/tub combination in their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loft apartment</a>. However, by removing the tub, they added several more layers to create a luxurious experience. A low curb reveals a patterned floor tile for a two-person shower. Double shower heads, body sprays, and a rain shower complete the upgraded vista.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="tub to shower conversion with double showerheads" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24706" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Accessibility with style</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The primary reason for Mickey’s remodel was to build a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/an-accessible-kitchen-and-bath-remodel-make-good-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom shower</a>. Looking towards retirement and possible limited mobility, he replaced the high-walled tub with a walk-in shower. His Sweeten contractor handled all of the paperwork for the co-op board approval so Mickey was able to focus on choosing materials.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-03.jpg" alt="tub to shower conversion with white subway tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47288" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Removing an unwieldy fixture</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charon and Lex&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/gramercy-park-bathroom-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apartment bathtub</a> took up too much space; i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t took up almost the whole room. The new shower with the glass door makes the room feel huge without the bulk. </span></p>
<div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35156 size-full" title="bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Replacing a bathtub for a standing shower leaves this space feeling spacious and streamlined" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A new layout with lots of personality</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by her own parent’s accessibility updates, Megan and Zak decided to follow suit when </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/carnegie-hill-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renovating their guest bathroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They converted the old bathtub to a standing shower and opted for no glass doors.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-white-toilet" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-4.jpg" alt="white bathroom with white toilet and double hung window before renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48156" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Setting bathroom priorities</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removing the small, pink tub in Giulia’s bath was the best way to get more space for a larger sink. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She designed an</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brownstone-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> open shower</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was shorter than the original tub, making more room for a larger vanity and mirror.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-shower-curtain-pink-bathtub" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-6.jpg" alt="white shower curtain over a pink bathtub and small bathroom with white toilet before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48158" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-6.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-6-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Safety first</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Elaine, safety was paramount. When undergoing the bathtub to shower conversion, she tasked her Sweeten contractor with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">building a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/brooklyn-bathroom-staying-in-place-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">walk-in shower</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with accessible features: a hand bar and shower, plus a rough stone floor for traction.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tackling a bigger bathroom renovation project—six ways to make the most of the space you have</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a too-small bathroom?  While some renovators choose to expand the space or reimagine the footprint, those types of changes can <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase the budget</a>. So how can you make a bathroom appear larger with the space you already have? Read on to learn how Sweeten general contractors undertook bigger bathroom renovation projects. Here&#8217;s how they updated homeowners&#8217;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> small bathrooms to feel bigger—without changing the overall square footage.</span></p>
<h2><strong>1.) Install a floating vanity<br />
</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25453 size-full" title="floating vanity" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="floating vanity" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>If having a closet in or next to your bathroom isn&#8217;t an option, consider a vanity with drawers or doors. Some vanities are freestanding, but floating vanities are attached to the wall and do not “sit” on the ground. That extra space means the flooring can extend to the wall, which actually makes the room look larger. Nancy&#8217;s bathroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/head-turner-bathroom-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perfectly demonstrates that idea</a>, showing off the ornate black and white tile. Since she couldn&#8217;t change the layout of the space due to code compliance, this offered a great alternative in the overall vision of opening up the bathroom.</p>
<h2><b>2.) Or if you have enough storage, try a pedestal sink</b><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38077 mt-24 mb-0 size-full" title="black-hexagon-bathroom-floor-tiles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02.jpg" alt="pedastal sink with black faucet and fixtures and wooden shelves above toilet and black hexagon floor tiles and medicine cabinet with mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h2>
<p class="p1">If storage isn’t an issue, a classic space-saving option is a pedestal sink. In Saira and her husband’s East Village apartment, they had two small bathrooms they needed to update to accommodate their family of four. In the powder room, they opted for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/guest-full-bathroom-renovation-east-village/"><span class="s1">classic, white porcelain pedestal sink.</span></a> They used shelving above the toilet and a mirrored vanity for their storage needs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17.webp" alt="Black and white bathroom remodel" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57267" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy and Chris chose a</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pedestal sink</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with console legs that show off the tiled walls and floors, and give this classic NYC bathroom a more spacious feel. &#8220;In such a small space, we took a cue from hotel bathrooms and put a pedestal sink atop console legs to keep the space open. An extra-tall recessed medicine cabinet provides both storage and electrical outlets,&#8221; Jeremy shared.</span></p>
<h2><b>3) Stick with neutrals or go tone-on-tone</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33805 size-full" title="glass-shower-door-vanity-mirror" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="white farmhouse sink near glass shower door to walk in shower and vanity mirror over marble countertop after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Too much color can be hard to get right in a small space. A safe bet to opening up a small bathroom? Choose neutrals that don’t compete for attention. Jessica and Kevin swapped out pink marble for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/a-bathroom-goes-from-clunky-to-classy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white and gray color palette</a> that lent their space a more spa-like feel.</p>
<h2><b>4.) Opt for a larger mirror</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36996 size-full" title="small bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18.jpg" alt="small bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina had wanted to renovate her 550-square-foot studio in Murray Hill since she moved in. She knew exactly what she wanted—including tons of bathroom storage space. To achieve this, she </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/alcove-studio-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">installed a large, mirrored medicine cabinet.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The mirror takes up most of the wall, automatically giving the room the illusion of more space, without changing the layout at all.<br />
</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>5.) Take advantage of wall space</b><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22407 mt-24 mb-0 size-full" title="recessed storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="Scandinavian white bathroom with storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h2>
<p class="p1">Even if your bathroom has a small footprint, you can always build onto the wall, or in Maria and Eric&#8217;s case <i>into</i> the walls. Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-modern-gut-renovation-goes-scandinavian-chic/"><span class="s1">recessed shelving</span></a> unit tucks in just behind their bathroom door. This minimalist solution boasts more storage without adding bulk.</p>
<h2><b>6.) Ditch the tub &amp; shower curtain for a bigger bathroom</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30666 size-full" title="light-filled bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01.jpg" alt="light-filled bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>A fairly common bigger bathroom renovation project is to ditch the tub in favor of a walk-in shower with <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-new-baths-top-off-a-remodel-odyssey/">a glass shower door.</a> Using glass in place of a shower curtain allows light to flow through the space, which is especially important if the bathroom has a single source of natural light. In one of Tara and Mike&#8217;s bathrooms, they did just that, while leaving the rest of the floorplan as-is.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35156 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Gramercy Park bathroom, bathroom renovation, tile, glass divider, tile floor, tile wall, toilet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A glass bathroom door is even more effective when used in an </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/gramercy-park-bathroom-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open shower style</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like in Charon and Lex’s bathroom. Removing the tub altogether opened up the space, making it more comfortable for two people (especially since Lex is 6&#8217;2&#8243;)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another factor that worked in their favor: the use of one color (in different shades). </span></p>

<h3>Before: Give a Gramercy bathroom a much-needed facelift for storage, style</h3>
<p>Dated tile (“the bathroom looked like a 1980s Mafia movie!”) and no storage (“with a pedestal sink and no drawers or shelving, we didn&#8217;t even have room to store extra toilet paper”) drove homeowners Jessica and Kevin to finally renovate their bathroom. She’d been living in the 750-square-foot, one-bedroom co-op overlooking Pete&#8217;s Tavern, the oldest tavern in NYC, for seven years. Renovating the bathroom had been on her remodeling bucket list since day one.</p>

<p>After getting married, they used wedding money to fund their renovation, enthusiastic to update the aesthetics by losing the “burnt-red marble, gold hardware, and wall-to-wall mirrors” and adding storage solutions. Jessica <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose her Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>: A dramatic change resulted when white modern tile replaced the “heinous red marble tile” Jessica still has nightmares about. Their bathroom, which was trapped in an ‘80s vibe, became a calming, minimal space aligned with the couple’s style. The white and pale gray palette lent the former bathroom new life with a spa feel.</p>
<p>The couple replaced the “clunky” bathtub with a modern shower with two heads and switched to chrome fixtures. Next, they <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tackled their storage woes</a>. A console sink with open shelving for towels gave an airy illusion and contributed to the room feeling more spacious.</p>
<p>While designing their new bath space, Jessica was mindful of potential future buyers. She said, “When I bought the apartment, I found it very frustrating there were so many permanent fixtures, including a built-in glass shelf over the toilet, wall-to-wall mirrors, and tile covering most of the walls.&#8221; To give the next homeowners the room to express their own personal touch, she kept the walls painted instead of tiled, installed a mirror that could easily be replaced over the vanity table, and hung two simple towel hooks.</p>

<p>Jessica offered this sage advice, ”If you are purchasing your own materials for the renovation, have it arrive before the start date.” This will help <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">avoid waiting for products to arrive</a> and delaying the project.</p>
<p>Now Jessica calls her new bathroom a happy place and is appreciative of her well-matched contractor. “As with any NYC renovation, you tend to get a lot of complaints about uncontrollable things like dust and loud noise which comes with the territory of living in an apartment building. My Sweeten contractor handled everything like a pro and had much more patience for people than I ever could have exhibited,” she said. “He was extremely flexible and true to his word with regards <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to price and timing of the project</a>.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Jessica <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doubled their storage</a> by adding a two-drawer unit under the existing vanity table as well as a cabinet, creating a “personal heaven” she uses every morning to get ready for work.</p>
<p><em>Thanks for sharing your fantastic bathroom and vanity renovation with Sweeten, Jessica and Kevin!</em></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27199 mb-10 size-chrono" title="glass shower enclosure" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="frameless glass shower doors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p><span class="img-label"><em>Nancy and Aram&#8217;s </em><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/head-turner-bathroom-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>bathroom renovation</em></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The shower has, at last, stepped up next to the tub—separate and equal—to become a focal point in the bath. However, there’s more to a fabulous shower experience than a multi-spray <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/shower-heads-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower head</a> and pretty tiled walls. You will also want to consider the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower door</a>, which sets the tone for the shower’s overall appearance and harmony with your bath’s décor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spa-like and almost invisible? Check. Framed and architecturally attention-worthy? Check. As you research and shop, you’ll find a shower door to suit every bathing enclosure and décor. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors, surveys the factors involved in selecting a shower door to better inform you as you research this important feature.</p>
<h3>Glass shower doors: Getting started</h3>
<p>You may decide to place the shower next to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tub</a> because it looks nice, or because you don’t want to make major changes to the water lines. Perhaps you only need a shower in a space with limited square footage, so you want to put it in the corner. Wherever the shower ends up, your design will require one of the following door mounting options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Framed shower doors</li>
<li>Semi-frameless shower doors</li>
<li>Frameless shower doors</li>
<li>Freestanding shower doors</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The style you choose can be based mostly on your taste. However, before committing, you will want to consult with your contractor to assess the bathroom space for quirks. After all, not all bathrooms are made alike: dimensions vary from ceiling to floor, plumbing lines wander, walls and floors are not always plumb. Your contractor can help you determine the best location for the shower, including making sure that the walls can bear the weight of frameless shower doors.</p>

<h3>Styles for glass shower doors</h3>
<p>The door you select will depend not only on your preferences as to the style and movement of the door but also any space restrictions. Is there room for the door to swing open? Or can the width handle sliding doors? Placement of controls on one or two walls and the width and height of the shower enclosure will also factor in. Consider the following options:</p>
<h4>Sliding shower doors</h4>
<p>Two panels fit in a frame and slide in either direction to open and close.</p>

<h4>Swing or pivot shower doors</h4>
<p>A single pane attached to a wall swings open from the left or right.</p>
<h4>Door and panel</h4>
<p>One narrow pane is fixed to the wall while next to it, a panel is fixed with hinges to the other wall and operates as the door.</p>

<h4>Butterfly or bi-fold doors</h4>
<p>Two equal-size panels are hinged at the center to open inward.</p>
<h4>Fixed shower doors</h4>
<p>A single pane of glass attached to the wall holding the showerhead protects the bathroom from splashes; the rest of the shower opening remains uncovered.</p>
<h3>Shower door mounting options</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, framed was the only way to go. (Remember those shower doors when you were growing up?) With the widespread popularity of open design, semi-frameless shower doors and frameless showers have caught homeowners&#8217; attention. Improvements in mounting systems, including thicker glass supported by sleeker, stronger hinges, means you can have a shower that seems to float or even disappear. Your choices come down to four solutions:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Framed shower doors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This product features a metal frame around all four edges of the operating doors. In addition, metal channels framing the shower opening allow for hinges that attach swinging doors or the gliding motion of sliding doors. Framed glass doors are created to fit standard shower openings. The appearance doesn’t have to be standard, though. Manufacturers offer a range of looks, from super contemporary clean-lined chrome to matte black in a windowpane pattern from Coastal Shower Doors that will conjure your own private Downton Abbey. Duravit makes a glass enclosure with two self-locking doors that fold against either wall when not in use, so the shower disappears entirely.</p>
<p>Special details notwithstanding, framed doors can be the thriftiest way to go and the easiest to install. The glass panes are typically 1/4-inch thick</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Semi-frameless shower doors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Semi-frameless shower doors may include framing around the entire shower opening, but not around the actual door panels. It also typically features 1/4-inch glass. Semi-frameless doors lend themselves to some creative trends in headers, like exposed industrial-style hardware with rollers and bars that suggest barn door hardware.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Frameless shower doors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not completely without hardware, frameless is still the way to go if you want an open, seamless, truly spa-like effect for your shower. Advances in hardware engineering and glass manufacturing make this type of installation appear to float. Glass panels attach to hinges that then attach to walls. There is commonly a combo of a fixed panel and a swinging door, both made of 5/8-inch safety glass. Besides the hinges, the only hardware is the door handle and possibly a towel bar, though after going to all this trouble, why would you want anything to block the view?</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Freestanding shower doors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the very high end, you will find freestanding shower enclosures. They consist of a shower pan with a four-sided metal framework in which glass panels fit, one of them a door. Drummonds, an English manufacturer, makes several models for the United States market. If you can afford the hefty price tag, you can have this shower up and working in a couple of hours.</p>
<h3>Finishes for glass shower doors</h3>
<p>Finally, you will choose a finish for the frame and its accompanying pieces—hinges and hardware. A good rule of thumb is to choose the finish that matches your shower head and any other shower fittings, like a hand shower or jets. Of course, the choice is up to you, and here, too, is a range—brushed, nickel, oil-rubbed bronze, and ever-popular chrome.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All edges of your shower door should arrive finished or polished. Styles for the appearance of the flat surface include:</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Opaque shower door</b><b>s</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A holdover from the previous century, opaque shower doors are good for those seeking privacy. Ask to see a manufacturer’s offerings in this category, which can range from pebbled to brushed to the appearance of raindrops.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Clear glass shower doors</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These remain a strong trend in bathrooms. Rightly so: they promote the open appearance in a bath while showing off sleek shower fittings and surface treatments of tile or stone.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Tinted glass shower doors</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are created during the manufacturing process and come in subtle, natural tones like gray, bronze, and blue. As a bonus, they complement America&#8217;s favorite bathroom color—white—as well as stone, tile, and metals for faucets and showerheads, and controls.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Etched glass</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Etched glass shower doors permit privacy with opaque designs etched onto clear glass. Patterns available can be figurative, like images from nature, or abstract. Custom designs will cost you more and must be specially ordered. The etching is on the outside face of the shower.</p>
<h3>Glass shower doors: Thickness &amp; durability</h3>
<p>The less framework for the door, the thicker the glass. Standard glass shower doors come 1/2- or 3/8-inch thick; frameless doors should be 5/8-inch thick. All must be made of safety glass, which shatters into small pieces when broken, not into lethal shards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The shower door—a seemingly small yet often overlooked feature—makes a huge impact on the look and feel of your bathroom. As you make your decision, think about how you shower, and what’s important to you as you experience your daily bathroom rituals. You want the shower to feel like it’s part of the of the bathroom. The right glass shower door can do that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A glass shower door brings light and transparency to any space</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While shower curtains can add flair to your bathroom, they aren’t always ideal for smaller spaces or a more streamlined look. Enter the glass shower door: it immediately makes a room feel more spacious, modern, and clean. They’re also easy on upkeep—a quick swipe with a squeegee and you’re good to go. These glass panels come in a variety of styles, can be framed with metal or rimless for a “floating” look, and can be fixed, sliding, or made to swivel on a hinge. Take a look below for some favorite bathroom renovations done by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Set your bathing experience with a wide range of shower heads to satisfy every mood, style, and budget</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26484 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spa shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped-723x482.jpg" alt="shower heads" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What’s your preferred method of bathing? If like most Americans, it’s the shower, then you probably have a showering style. But it may not be the same for all the members of your family. Perhaps you like a gentle relaxing wash, while your partner prefers a bracing, wake-me-up experience. Maybe the type of spray depends on the day. Good news: Many shower heads include adjustable features that let you select the spray pattern and the intensity of the water flow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s a lot to consider. As you narrow down the selection, a few factors play first into your decision:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*The type of shower experience</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*The size of the shower</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*The style of your bathroom</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Experience:</strong> If you’re going through the trouble to replace the head, or remodel your bath entirely, consider thoughtfully how you shower. What’s the most important function for you? Rinsing off after a workout? Soothing tired muscles? Unwinding with some water therapy? Many manufacturers today offer features that allow you to get a custom luxury experience at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Size:</strong> Take into account, too, the dimensions of the shower. If it’s big enough for two, you may want twin shower heads, or one adjustable and one fixed. Or you may indulge in an oversize rain shower centered overhead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Style:</strong> Take into account your bath décor. Whether your look is traditional or contemporary, you can find a shower head to suit the space. However, most of the new products tend toward the sleek and straight-lined, which may not suit a Victorian-style bathroom.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24334 size-chrono" title="shower panel with rainfall and waterfall features" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-18-723x1085.jpg" alt="shower heads" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<h3>Shower head fixture options</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even a simple, inexpensive shower head can provide a satisfying shower, but a higher price point provides more options. Here’s a rundown of the types of shower heads you’ll find as you shop. (Note: Check with your contractor before your final selection. You need to be sure your home’s plumbing can handle the model you want, particularly if you choose to install more than one.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Single-head:</strong> The simplest go-to style, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/molly-bathroom-renovation-ditmas-park/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-head</a> is attached to the wall at the height you determine and then it stays there. Some models come with an adjustable shank so you can tip the head higher or lower or side-to-side, as you wish. You can find this version with one or multiple spray modes, from concentrated to mist and even pulsating, which can be adjusted with a lever or a twirl of an encircling ring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Handheld:</strong> Attached to flexible tubing, this <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/home-improves-view-inside/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower head</a> can be moved to spray wherever you want, including rinsing down walls after cleaning the shower stall. When not in use, this type hooks into a wall-mounted cradle or onto a slide bar that lets it glide up and down on the wall. Either installation method allows it to be used as a fixed shower head. This is a great option for its versatility and convenience. It also benefits a shared shower with bathers of different heights or a person who may need to be seated when showering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dual-head:</strong> As the term indicates, this style offers two shower heads, one fixed and one handheld. Another <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combo</a> could be a rain shower head and a handheld. A single set of levers or handles controls temperature, but a diverter valve can allow the bather to operate one or the other shower head, or both, at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rain shower head:</strong> This <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fixture</a> comes round or square in shape. The face is flat and large and fitted with many small holes through which water flows to simulate a rainstorm. The water flow is typically gentle, and best suited to a soothing experience than to routines like washing and rinsing hair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Shower systems:</strong> More elaborate than a dual-head arrangement, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower system</a> typically comprises multiple shower head components including a rain shower head, a hand shower, body sprays, and misters, to achieve an ultra-luxurious spa experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26567 size-chrono" title="rain shower head" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="shower heads" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<h3>Spray patterns</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shower heads come with a single spray mode, or with multiple functions, like these popular water works:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*Full-body spray: a full, even stream of water for daily bathing</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*Massage or pulsating spray: emitting a pulsating stream of water tension</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*Soft aerated: mixing air and water to provide a gentle flow</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*Needle: a fine yet penetrating spray</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of these shower heads will also include settings that let you toggle between wide and narrow water flow. Some manufacturers will go up to 12 settings with varying intensities and combos of the above-described modes. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24008 size-chrono" title="black matte shower fixtures" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg" alt="shower heads" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
</span></p>
<h3>Fixture finishes</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just like your sink faucet, you can expect a vast array of finishes—brushed or polished chrome, brushed or polished nickel, stainless steel, brushed or oil-rubbed bronze, polished or antique brass, as well as baked-on enamel or epoxy finishes that come in a few colors, most commonly black or white.</p>
<p>Manufacturers also boast finishes that resist water spots, particularly an issue if your water is hard, but polished finishes will still require attention with a soft cloth to keep that mirror-like appearance.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Charles_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26482 size-chrono" title="handheld shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Charles_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="shower heads" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<h3>Saving water</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All shower heads made today are required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to emit water at a flow of no more than 2.5 gallons per minute (GPM). Look for the WaterSense label, a program from the EPA that certifies shower components that use no more than 2 GPM, or 20 percent less than the 2.5 GPM requirement. The program also covers standards of performance, so a WaterSense product should offer a satisfying shower experience. Another benefit: In addition to conserving a precious natural resource, you’ll save on your utility bills, including the water heater.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A shower head may be small, but it packs a lot of power in its compact form to give you the bathing experience you want in any given moment. Choose wisely, and enjoy the soothing, rejuvenating, invigorating results. You deserve it!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Bringing a dilapidated <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16732" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bath</a> into the 21st century in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Last week, we saw how Natalie and Cartier transformed the <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/perfect-custom-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen and living room</a> of their one-bedroom apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops. Their bathroom was in a similar state of disrepair from a rust-stained bathtub and matching sink to the peeling, flowery wallpaper and lavender tiles that were not to the couple’s taste at all. With the help of their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a>, they implemented a set of bathroom renovation ideas that contrasted white tiles with dark grout for a look that’s thoroughly modern.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: As in the rest of the apartment, Natalie and Cartier created a clean, streamlined look by combining white tile, flat-front cabinetry in a dark wood finish, and chrome Grohe fixtures. The choice of a 4” x 12” subway tile for the walls gave the bath a more contemporary look than the traditional 3” x 6” subway tile. The couple chose a dark grout for contrast and paired it with charcoal <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooring</a> in porcelain tile. Sleek bar <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lighting</a> and recessed lights maintained the unfussy look. The space was a typical NYC bathroom, which meant that they had to maximize <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage space</a> without it feeling too cramped. Another one of their bathroom renovation ideas involved two niches built into the wall of the shower to provide a convenient area for storing bath products. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA sink and vanity</a> helped to keep the cost down while the pair splurged on a thermostatic <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/luxury-shower-systems-steaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower system</a> that includes a rain shower, a handheld showerhead, as well as a faucet. They decided on the thermostatic shower valves because of bad experiences in past apartments with drastic changes in shower temperature, and this technology addressed that problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Cartier hated the way that shower curtains got dingy over time (no matter how diligent you were about airing them out!). As a result, he was particularly excited about the glass partition between the tub and the sink which simplifies the task of cleaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Porcelain floor tile, PT 12&#8243; x 24&#8243; Basaltina Linosa (cut into squares): <a href="https://www.arizonatile.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona Tile</a>. White 4” x 12” Glossy Subway wall tile: <a href="https://www.southcypress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Cypress</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 5 remodeling projects prove that with a $15-20K budget, homeowners can get <em>a lot</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tiles are popping off the wall, the toilet makes a strange gurgling sound when it flushes, and stepping into the shower feels like entering a dark closet. If this situation sounds familiar, then your bathroom is ready for an upgrade. But what will it cost? A $15k-20k budget is an excellent range to cover all the basic bathroom renovation costs—materials, installation, and labor included—for a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toilet</a>, sink, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vanity</a>, fixtures, tile, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooring</a>, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lighting</a>. With that in mind, it’s also important to consider that the need for plumbing, electrical, or layout changes will likely add to the amount. <span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with general contractors showcases five of their bathroom remodels below as</span> good examples of what a $15K-20K budget will allow.</p>
<h3>$15k takes the blues away in a Brooklyn bathroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26277 size-chrono" title="$15k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09-723x964.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="964" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allison and Jovito&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon purchasing a 1910 brick row house, Allison and Jovito got to work on a serious renovation, starting with the upstairs bathroom. The bathroom hadn’t been touched since the 1950s and was very blue—blue tub, blue toilet, blue tile. With a budget of $15k to cover essential bathroom renovation costs, which limited them from expanding the footprint or moving plumbing, the goal was to focus on form and function. A new, dual-flush toilet, console sink, and clawfoot tub—all in white—replaced the original blue fixtures. The simple, classic look they achieved with marble flooring and white subway tile mesh well with the history of the house.</p>
<h3>Sleek fixtures and denim-like tile shine for $15K</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25194 size-chrono" title="$15k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01-723x1066.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1066" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario and Joe&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario and Joe’s main motivation for their apartment renovation was the bathroom. With a budget of $15k, they kicked off their remodel with a gray porcelain tile that had the look of coarse denim and installed it along the floor and vanity wall. The sink was swapped out for a streamlined <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA vanity</a> that was customized to fit a raised basin sink, and the existing mirrored medicine cabinet was replaced with a much larger one. A glass shower door, slim toilet, brushed nickel fixtures, and light above the vanity complete the transformation.</p>
<h3>For $17K, a Brooklyn couple raises the ceiling and gets double cabinet storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25122 size-chrono" title="$17k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000-723x1064.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1064" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-ellen-bens-brooklyn-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellen and Ben&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Kensington, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Budgeting $17k for the bathroom renovation costs, Ellen and Ben decided to focus on modernizing their master bath. To make it feel more open, the stand-up shower and dropped ceiling were removed and replaced with an open shower stall fitted with a glass door. The beige vanity was kicked to the curb and a wooden side table from West Elm, customized to fit a marble countertop and sink, took its place. Two medicine cabinets installed side by side provide ample storage. A new toilet and fixtures complete the functional upgrade, while black hexagon floor tile and floor-to-ceiling white subway tile fulfill the modern aesthetic.</p>
<h3>An architect&#8217;s $20K travel-inspired bathroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24180 size-chrono" title="$20k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-723x1084.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1084" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/an-architect-drafts-a-travel-inspired-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian and Erin&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An uninspired bathroom led Brian and Erin to a $20k remodel that would take their space on an international adventure. The remodel was prompted by outdated fixtures and finishes from the ‘80s and a leak in an upstairs bathroom that had ruined the ceiling. To create a unique space, Brian drew inspiration from the many hotel bathrooms he had seen while traveling for work as an architect. Floor-to-ceiling white subway tile was chosen as a simple backdrop, while blue penny tile was selected for the floor. Mirroring the blue tile, a luxurious clawfoot tub with a blue exterior took the look from standard to standout. The rest of the space was outfitted with a new toilet and bronze fixtures, an antique basin table and sink, and a custom red balau wood medicine cabinet.</p>
<h3>For $20K, everything had to go (except the tub and toilet!)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20616 size-chrono" title="$20k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="509" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-300x211.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celeste&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stained limestone tiling in her bathroom was the tipping point for Celeste, who, after a few unsuccessful attempts to remove the stains, budgeted $20k for bathroom renovation costs. Creating more <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> space became a priority, so a custom vanity with unique drawer configurations was installed. In order to decrease visual clutter, a dedicated spot within the vanity was designed to hold a small trash can. Celeste chose a marble tile with a cube effect for the floor and beveled subway tile for the walls. Although she decided to keep her original tub and toilet, she finished the look with additional new materials like the sink, countertop, and a new lighting fixture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Shower systems offer spa-like luxury, from multi-functional showerheads to a steam shower and chromotherapy</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25648 size-chrono" title="shower systems" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg" alt="shower systems" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><em>(Above) Leslie&#8217;s renovation with Sweeten resulted in a separate room for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full shower system</a> including a steam shower, rain showerheads and jet sprays</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Americans have become highly sophisticated about their renovation choices and preferences. And nowhere is this more evident than in the bath. Homeowners count on their bathrooms to help them rev up in the morning and wind down in the evening. Manufacturers now create elaborate shower systems that provide a luxurious shower experience. Here, Sweeten&#8217;s guide to modern shower systems outlines popular features and add-ons, with tips on adding one into your bathroom remodel plans.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Design to go with the flow</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s begin with the layout. Shower systems should be isolated, almost like a room, and shouldn&#8217;t be part of a tub. While it doesn’t have to be big enough to fit two, there should be enough footage to move around and extend your arms fully. Simple materials and clean lines deliver the best aesthetic to convey a feeling of serenity. This means frameless glass doors and a floor-level shower tray. (Bonus: It’s fully accessible!) A built-in bench, particularly if the shower is clad in <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stone</a>, adds another luxurious touch. Make sure you assess your plumbing capacity to be sure it can supply sufficient volume pressure. Your water heater must also be ready if you include a steam shower or body jets. (These features often operate at the same time as the shower.) Ensure your contractor evaluates the drain so it evacuates all that water quickly. Next, you&#8217;ll want to plan your shower system features!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Luxury shower system options</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luxury shower systems in the home go way beyond simple showerheads, even one with diverse spray patterns. The typical luxury shower system is a combination of individual features that come as a unit in a panel, or those you choose individually. You&#8217;ll want a shower head with several spray patterns, a hand shower on a wall-mount slide bar, and several pairs of body jets (six to eight are common). This arrangement should come with a thermostatic diverter that controls the water temperature to a preset degree. This means you don’t have to fiddle with it each time you turn it on.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Shower panels</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a few hundred dollars, you can find an all-in-one shower panel at a box store such as Home Depot. (This is at least half of what you would spend on a shower system of individual components.) The panel includes a showerhead, two to eight body jets, and an adjustable hand shower. Advantageously, a shower panel provides quick installation at a price that fits most budgets. The disadvantage: the panel mounts to the wall, extending several inches into the shower space. If you want a sleeker look, you will need to go with individual components that recess into the wall. Either way, make sure that your plumbing provides sufficient water pressure for all the features to operate simultaneously. If not, your contractor should make adjustments before installation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rain shower heads</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An increasingly popular type of luxury shower head is the rain shower head. Rain shower heads are preferred for the soothing effect that its name indicates. These luxury-type shower heads can be mounted to the wall and angled to drop directly down, or installed on the ceiling. Look for an extra-wide spray span, as much as 15 inches, and a choice of spray patterns, from gentle to drenching. <a href="https://www.grohe.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grohe</a> and <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler</a> also offer digital controls with their rain shower systems. These controls allow you to preset your favorite spray pattern with your preferred water temperature. You simply push a button to start your shower and enter your specific experience. Kohler developed a showering panel that simulates the varying sizes and angles of raindrops as they fall, for a fully sensory occurrence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you really want to splurge, you can get a shower panel installed in the ceiling that will shower you with several spray patterns simultaneously. This requires special framing for the ceiling, so you need to plan this feature before you start your renovation.</p>

<h3>Body sprays</h3>
<p>These components allow for water therapy that hits every inch of your body to soothe or stimulate. Surface-mounted or recessed, the sprays are typically installed in pairs. Pay careful attention to placement, particularly if people of varying heights will use the shower. Swivel body sprays can help for minor adjustments. The top-level jets target the shoulders, the middle, the waist or hips, and the lowest, the thighs or knees. Some jets pop out when in operation, then retract when the water is turned off. You can find these sprays in the classic faucet and showerhead finishes—chrome, nickel, bronze, polished or brushed—and in square or round shapes from most major manufacturers including <a href="https://www.americanstandard-us.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Standard</a>, Kohler, <a href="https://www.hansgrohe-usa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hansgrohe</a>, Grohe, <a href="https://www.deltafaucet.com/bathroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delta</a>, and <a href="https://www.moen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moen</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Steam</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Technological advances have made it possible to bring the coveted spa experience of steam into modern homes. The operation appears simple: steam is emitted by heads installed on the shower wall, and operated by a control pad programmed for temperature and session length. However, you will need to plan with your contractor to allow for several precautions. Don&#8217;t forget: steam showers generate more moisture and heat than a regular shower. As a result, your contractor will first install vapor proofing material to prevent water vapor from seeping through the walls. The shower door should be airtight, too, so water doesn’t escape to create mildew on wallpaper and paint. The ceiling should be curved so that condensed vapor droplets run down the walls, instead of dripping on you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For operation, a steam shower requires a generator and a ventilation unit. Both of these features are concealed from sight. Accordingly, your contractor can help you to determine the best, most effective placement for each. Alternatively, you can buy a stand-alone steam shower, complete with rain shower, hand shower, massage jets, whirlpool tub, steam generator, and LED lighting. Companies that specialize in steam showers, as well as major manufacturers like Kohler or <a href="https://www.whirlpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whirlpool</a>, offer many choices. If you don&#8217;t want to go the custom route, a two-person unit will cost you about $2,000. If you are creating a custom steam shower, expect your costs to double, to about $4,000. For either route: work with a contractor to ensure properly-installed plumbing and electricity.</p>

<h4>Seating for shower systems</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When planning to introduce a steam shower to your bathroom, plan for it to be big enough for at least two people to use. Also, allow footage for a bench for lounging and even reclining.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Chromotherapy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know that humans crave the healing power of light based on our innate need for sunlight and full-spectrum light in wintertime. You can isolate the individual colors that make up full-spectrum for healing effects in the bath. This is called chromotherapy. You’ll want at least four <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lights</a> installed in your shower ceiling for even illumination. You can find LED versions in primary colors, and connect them to a separate switch in the shower. Amazon sells chromotherapy bulbs in seven colors—orange, red, blue, aqua, indigo, green, and yellow. You can change them at will, or set them to cycle through all the colors. Make sure your contractor adds a dimming capability. You can also choose a chromotherapy package made to go with a tub or steam shower enclosure from a manufacturer.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Adding music to your shower system</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once upon a time, you set your radio on the counter to listen to news and music. Kohler is among a handful of manufacturers that lets you bring music right into the shower. They offer a shower head with a wireless speaker that you can connect to your phone with Bluetooth® technology. The speaker docks in the center of the showerhead when in use, and is removable for recharging the battery, which lasts up to seven hours. The showerhead is available as a wall-mount or rain shower. Grohe also makes a rechargeable wireless speaker that attaches to the slide bar of the hand shower. For under $100, you can opt for wireless Bluetooth® speakers, compatible with most smartphones, that attach to the wall by suction cups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to the bathroom, it makes sense that your shower should provide the personalized experience you seek. By adding one or all of the features described above, you can luxuriate in your favorite spa rituals every day without leaving home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tiled niches and marble shelves&#8230;pretty and practical</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the minimal approach of floor-to-ceiling tile in the shower surround can be beautiful, where does one keep the shampoo? If the answer is the lip of your tub, adding a few shelves or niches in the shower can be a game-changer. Below, five homeowners who worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, mix storage and organization with style.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29227 size-chrono" title="penny tile shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29228 mb-0 size-chrono" title="penny tile shower niches" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/penny-tile-beige-bath-blue-beauty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rachel and Michael</a> designed a backdrop of penny tile in a multitude of blue hues for their shower, extending the tile to nearby niches. The mosaic, clearly visible behind the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glass door</a>, is now the couple&#8217;s favorite part of the bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29229 size-chrono" title="marble shower surround" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-07-723x1087.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="723" height="1087" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29230 mb-0 size-chrono" title="marble tile corner shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-10-723x1090.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="723" height="1090" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marble corner shelves were cut from the leftover tile for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/holly-kitchen-bath-renovation-greenwich-village/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holly and Christian’s</a> space, an idea that scores points for ingenuity and thriftiness.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario and Joe</a> used gray porcelain tile with the appearance of coarse denim to fill the alcoves in their shower, a callback to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor tile</a> and accent wall behind the sink vanity that ties the room together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29333 size-chrono" title="glass shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-09-600x401.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="600" height="401" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-09.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-09-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-16852 mb-0 size-chrono" title="glass shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-10-600x899.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="600" height="899" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-10.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-10-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>For a sleek, streamlined approach, glass shelves attached to the tile surround in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/new-life-half-bath-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this half-bath</a> create the perfect perch for bottles of shampoo and conditioner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-05-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29233 mb-0 size-chrono" title="tiled shower nices" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-05-1-723x1084.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="723" height="1084" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-pallavi-keyurs-murray-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pallavi and Keyur</a> added some much-needed depth with contrasting black accent tile to their shower niches and along the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tub</a> exterior in their mostly white bath.</p>
