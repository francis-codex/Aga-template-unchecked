										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A self-proclaimed millennial&#8217;s first renovation in Midtown East</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Sherry, a recent college graduate, was excited to make her family’s rental property in Manhattan into her first home. Once she got a job offer in New York, she knew it was time to remodel the outdated space. The renovation process started with a lot of compromise between Sherry and her then-boyfriend, but over time, evolved into a project all her own. After posting her project to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, she chose the one she felt would bring her ideas for each room to life. Here, the journey to the final design of her first major renovation.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My family purchased an apartment in Midtown East during the height of the 2008 financial crisis and immediately turned it into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/renovate-your-rental-property-wisely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rental property</a>. While in Connecticut for college, I dreamt of moving to New York and making that apartment my first home. The property hadn’t been renovated since being built in the ‘80s and felt outdated. And there were practical issues to consider, including extensive water damage on the hardwood floors from a tenant who had left the living room windows open for weeks. When I started a job in New York last year, it was time to make my dream into a reality and take the plunge on renovating the space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35608 size-full" title="living room before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02.jpg" alt="millennial apartment renovation, manhattan renovation, before, living room, sliding doors" width="1084" height="723" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02.jpg 1084w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1084px) 100vw, 1084px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35602 mb-0 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, open living, living room, kitchen, dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, I was planning on moving into the apartment with my now ex-boyfriend and we each had a lot of ideas for what needed to be addressed in the remodel. While I was mostly focused on making aesthetic and design improvements, he thought we needed to change the entire floor plan by moving walls and doorways around. As we were trying to find a compromise, we heard about Sweeten and decided some expertise and personal attention would be helpful in guiding us through the home renovation process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project to Sweeten</a> and were matched with several potential general contractors who could make the changes we wanted within budget. We met with one who spent hours discussing all of our renovation ideas and possibilities in detail. We liked his vision and readiness to tackle the challenges of our space and knew immediately that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he was the right contractor</a> for us.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35609 size-full" title="living room before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-03.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, before, living room, kitchen" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-03.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-03-232x300.jpg 232w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-Before-03-600x774.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35605 mb-0 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, open living, living room, kitchen, dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we honed in on the details of the remodel, my boyfriend and I spent countless hours debating choices about tile, paint colors, and finishes. I realized the project wasn’t going how I had envisioned and about three months into the process, we broke up. I went back to the contractor and we agreed to scrap the original plan and completely redesigned everything in 48 hours. By the end of those two very stressful (but liberating!) days, we were ready to move forward.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35601 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, open living, kitchen, counter, sink, refrigerator" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of my first priorities was to update the<span style="color: #000000;"> <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a> throughout the apartment.</span> I knew I needed to address the water damage in the living room and also wasn’t in love with the original floorboards, which were narrow and felt outdated. I wanted to update the space in a more modern and millennial style, which meant making design choices that had a sense of utility while also being simple, sleek, and refined. We installed beautiful, wide, oak floorboards that anchored the space in an elegant way and became the foundation for the rest of my design choices. There&#8217;s a sense of an overall artistic feel leaning toward urban chic (simple, cool tones).</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35599 mb-0 size-full" title="stove" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-13.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, kitchen, cabinets, stove, range, stainless steal" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-13-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We needed to find ways to enlarge the<span style="color: #000000;"> living room and kitchen </span>as much as possible. We decided to remove a closet near the front door to add space to the living area while slimming the walls around the kitchen to keep it as open as possible. The decor was kept simple with lots of neutral grays and blues, which helped create the illusion of more space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <span style="color: #000000;">bathroom and bedroom</span>, however, would have strong design statements. In the bathroom, there were two: a beautiful, circular mirror with a beveled, asymmetrical frame that I fell in love with instantly, and the chevron shower tile (that I was inspired to use after looking through past <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten projects</a>!) I couldn’t resist adding two gorgeous sconces next to the mirror and lots of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in storage</a>. My Sweeten contractor helped bring these ideas to life within my budget; I made my choices for the lighting, the mirror, and tiles within the contractor’s app and signed off on each decision.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35593 size-full" title="shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-07.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, bathroom renovation, herringbone tile, matte black fixtures, storage shelf" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-07-723x1084.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>For the bedroom, I wanted to cultivate a more classic feel than what I had in the rest of the apartment. I chose to build the design around a Nepalese rug I owned, which had earthy tones and hints of red. The contractors customized my <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closet</a> for me and painted one of the walls a soothing gray to complement the deep hue of my red velvet headboard.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, my experience with Sweeten and my contractors could not have been more positive! Everyone involved was great about communicating challenges while still striving to make my dream a reality. Now that my cat, Zelda, and I have moved in, it’s such a pleasure to get ready every day in front of my beautiful bathroom vanity and walk on my smooth, new, hardwood floors knowing that I hand-picked every element. Designing your space from top to bottom is something I would recommend to everyone—the sense of satisfaction and pride in your space is well worth all the work involved!</p>

(<em>Above</em>) The café hosts community events, such as game and movie nights. (Check out the pull-down screen on the ceiling!)</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What is your company and where did the idea come from?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cassandre:</strong> Our company is Lakou Café. I&#8217;ve been living in Weeksville, which is a community in Crown Heights that&#8217;s actually the first free black community. I noticed there were a lot of people interested in their health with local gyms and parks for exercising, but there wasn’t a good variety of healthy food options. I also felt there weren&#8217;t many community spaces in the area. I wanted to create a space where somebody can get something light to eat and at the same time get to know the people in their community.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you move from the legal profession to become an entrepreneur?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cassandre:</strong> I&#8217;ve always had an interest in business, but from childhood, I had a desire to be a lawyer because I wanted to help advance my community. While in law school, I developed my narrative that would lead me to entrepreneurship. I chose a career in corporate law working on private equity transactions, mergers and acquisitions, and leveraged buyouts. This gave me a deeper look at how CEOs and upper-level management evaluate strategic business decisions. I also got a deeper understanding of business modeling and financial projections.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With these tools in my back pocket, I was armed to tackle my next goal of entrepreneurship. I find it rewarding to imagine something, build it, and work on it until it succeeds (a constant challenge!). Also, it&#8217;s amazing to provide value to customers and to help employees find gainful employment. It may not be for everyone, but it&#8217;s definitely for me. In my specific case, my neighborhood needed a beautiful place for fellowship and I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m able to provide an oasis for them.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How does the new space design represent your brand?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cassandre:</strong> My family is from Haiti, and Lakou is a Haitian word that means backyard or courtyard. It’s a place where the community hangs out, where religious ceremonies take place, where herbs are grown, where people play, or just chill. I thought that was a fitting name for the space that I wanted to create.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We really wanted to be on the Utica strip, because it&#8217;s between two main train lines, where there are tons of people who walk by every day, but unfortunately, we couldn&#8217;t find an actual backyard space. So we brought the outdoors inside with lots of plants and tables that look like tree trunks. We wanted a contemporary feel and added a cool twist like wicker lighting instead of wicker chairs. Bright colors like green or natural stone remind you of the outside. I think we did a good job making it feel a little bit like an escape.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Did your Sweeten contractor help you with any part of the design?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cassandre:</strong> We wanted a really long floating bench that’s probably about 20 feet. Our contractor was concerned that the weight of it might be a bit much, but we didn&#8217;t want a block bench. The wall that it was on originally didn&#8217;t have the brick exposed yet; we got rid of some it above the bench but not below. It kind of formed a little shelf underneath it so that we could place a bench on top and it would appear to be floating. It was great that he came up with the idea to help us get the aesthetic we wanted and still be able to support a lot of bodies and weight.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How was your experience working with Sweeten?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cassandre:</strong> I originally stumbled on Sweeten when I was just looking for contractors online. The contractor process is a bit more difficult mainly because a lot of people don&#8217;t want to refer contractors to you because they might have had a bad experience. Or some people feel even though a contractor had been good with them, they may not be good with me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten’s Client Services reached out to us after I filled out their form online. They explained the process to me, asked more about what we were trying to do, and what our budget was. They found five or six contractors they thought would be a good fit for us to reach out to. It also felt a bit like a safety net. If a contractor wasn&#8217;t responsive, I could reach out to Sweeten.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Cassandre-Davilmar-Juice-Bar-During-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34905 size-chrono" title="storefront during renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Cassandre-Davilmar-Juice-Bar-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="restaurant renovation, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Haitian Cafe " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Cassandre-Davilmar-Juice-Bar-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34908 mb-0 size-chrono" title="storefront after renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Cassandre-Davilmar-Juice-Bar-11-723x482.jpg" alt="restaurant renovation, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Haitian Cafe " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had a lot of delays because of the signing of the lease, but Sweeten checked in on us every now and then to see where we were with that. When we finally did begin the bidding process, Sweeten offered for us to send them all the bids to compare the information. In retrospect, I probably would have utilized that more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most valuable thing about the service is it seems like the contractors really appreciate being a part of the Sweeten network and they don&#8217;t want to jeopardize that in any way. So their goal is to make me as happy as they can. I didn&#8217;t have a strong fear that if the project was done and things weren&#8217;t perfect—which they&#8217;re never going to be completely perfect—that I&#8217;d never hear from this contractor again. That&#8217;s probably the biggest pro in my experience with Sweeten.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b></b>Simple ideas for the cook space deliver a big impact</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you value a calm, clutter-free space to do your cooking, consider the sleek and minimalist approach of the modern kitchen. The formula is simple: flat-front cabinets, integrated appliances, and little visual interruption. If that sounds like a recipe for a room that feels cold and empty, think again. Here are six kitchens by Sweeten homeowners that combine personal touches with clean lines and carefully edited design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26356 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="modern kitchen" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-05-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/open-kitchen-design-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marissa and Cody’s</a> kitchen, an all-white backdrop of IKEA cabinets and a matte hexagon tile backsplash create a neutral base while the wood-paneled island and oak flooring add a touch of warmth.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31162 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-723x482.jpg" alt="modern kitchen" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To create a seamless look, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren</a> swapped her range for a cooktop, nestled within the quartzite countertop, and oven, disguised with paneling to match the surrounding blue cabinets. White floor tile in the kitchen visually separates the space from the dining and living room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20051 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="modern kitchen" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening up the ceiling and exposing beams allowed <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lia and Chris</a> to bring an unexpected industrial element into their kitchen. Another refreshing detail: horizontal cabinets that echo the bold lines of the ceiling. To tie the look together, the existing hardwood floors were sanded down and brushed with a soft matte gray finish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21436 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="modern kitchen" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kate and Arthur</a> took the opposite approach to the standard white kitchen and opted for black cabinets, matte black backsplash tile, and soapstone countertops. A black sink basin completes the monochrome look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29282 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-14-723x1085.jpg" alt="modern kitchen" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-14-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-14-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-14.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To amp up the brightness in their windowless kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-loft-in-a-former-silk-warehouse-gets-a-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara and Ryan</a> chose glossy white cabinets and matched their backsplash to their countertops. The original Corinthian column lends character to the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27224 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="modern kitchen" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alicia and Ed</a> streamlined their kitchen design with gray, flat-front cabinets and a seamless white countertop that continues in a waterfall edge. A few, thoughtfully placed items along the counter keep the space from feeling sterile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brooklyn-interior-design-renovation/"><img decoding="async" title="open-kitchen-with-breakfast-bar" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47980 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse.jpg" alt="open kitchen with breakfast bar and hardwood floors and accent walls after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna moved into their two-bedroom home &#8212; a former kindergarten classroom in a converted South Slope / Greenwood Heights Catholic school &#8212; four years ago. High ceilings, check. Big windows, check. Modern urban oasis, check. Erica, who works for the City of New York, and Donna, a digital product consultant, were initially drawn to industrial and rustic decor as a way to balance and warm up the contemporary feel of their new space. But, after overspending on a pricey couch and accenting the windows and doors with a red paint that grew to irritate them both, the couple decided they needed design help. After they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a>, we introduced them to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/814" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten designer</a> to help bring new life to this old-school space.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="small-bedroom-with-hardwood-before-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47989 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3.jpg" alt="small bedroom with hardwood floor before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-Before-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="bedroom-with-teal-accent-wall" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47984 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2.jpg" alt="small bedroom with teal accent wall and wall lights and hardwood floors and windows after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Our designer had a lot of creative ideas. Some of the areas of our apartment that she transformed were not even on our radar design-wise until she pointed them out.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Erica W., Brooklyn Homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna focused first on their bedroom. They wanted tranquility, comfort, and a little romance; they also needed to maximize the long, narrow layout of the room and find art to make the space feel personal and vibrant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The designer sought to create a relaxed retreat, in tune with the couple&#8217;s design preferences. She put together an inspiration booklet to illustrate creative concepts, drawings, and to simply nail the creative vision. The trio took group shopping trips and worked together to upgrade the shabby-schoolhouse-chic vibe with cleaner lines, bolder colors, and improved. Their designer led the way with an accent wall in Benjamin Moore Venezuelan Sea, offset by the existing gray on the remaining walls. Two smart tricks here: first, the accent wall appears to wash onto the overdyed rug, lengthening <wbr />the space in a way that makes the furniture selections look custom and built-in, and second, the accent wall provides an immediate visual shift, just by painting a single wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="bedroom-with-teal-accent-wall" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47983 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1.jpg" alt="bedroom with teal accent wall and adjustable long reach wall mounted lights after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Erica-Schoolhouse-After-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna love the gray tufted Cisco Brothers bed &#8211; it anchors the room and offers geometric depth to the monochromatic bedding (full disclosure: I am <a href="https://sweeten.com/team/apartment-renovation-east-village/">partial to gray tufted upholstery</a>!). The designer found a gorgeous and super-functional armed lighting fixture on <a href="https://classifieds.apartmenttherapy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apartment Therapy Classifieds</a> to feature above the bed &#8211; a hat tip to Erica and Donna&#8217;s fondness for industrial pieces but with a decidedly glam finish. Mounting the lighting fixture on the wall above the bed freed up space on each bedside table, crucial in a room with just eight feet in width to spare. If you look closely, you can catch a side glimpse of Marilyn Monroe swimming in the photo on the left wall. Erica especially loves this piece and the shot of red and green it offers up to complement other accents in the room.</p>
<h2>&#8220;I sought to create a refreshingly relaxed retreat. The solution was to carry varying hues of blue and green heavily-pigmented accent walls &#8211; the colors of the sea &#8211; throughout the space. Serene, but invigorating.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>&#8211; </em>Sweeten Designer</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the open living room, their designer set out to rehab the &#8220;expensive mistakes&#8221; that frustrated Erica and Donna. They focused on highly saturated paint colors and new, more comfortable furniture. The windows are such a central feature to the space; the designer restored their presence with Benjamin Moore Super White throughout the room and cleared away stuff that had accumulated on the unusually deep window sills. They also selected a central wall to saturate with yellow, anchoring the space. To further play up the industrial loft theme, a structural beam and elements of the sprinkler system were coated in a dark bronze.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Donna swapped out their dining set for Eames molded chairs. The dining table, already part of their collection, reflects the couple&#8217;s love for reclaimed materials, but looks updated with the clean lines of the new chairs. The Milo Baughman coffee table is simple and uncluttered; the Saarinen side table plays up the clean and modern furniture touches &#8211; both were savvy finds on eBay.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Toward the kitchen, visitors get their first glimpse of an accent wall coated in Benjamin Moore Juniper. As a standalone feature, it&#8217;s a fun addition to the yellow and white throughout the room. But, it also serves as a sneak peak into the new bedroom and ties the spaces together visually. Erica and Donna revived the old kitchen cabinets, originally finished with a faux cherry wood stain, by painting them with Farrow &amp; Ball&#8217;s Light Blue. I love this color &#8211; it is equal parts vintage and modern, simple but playful.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Behind the kitchen, Erica and Donna invested in creating a new closet space to help them keep stuff organized and out of sight. Working from the design, this Sweeten contractor built shelving and enclosed the closet with sliding doors and simple hardware.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Here at Sweeten, we understand that pairing the correct architect and client is more than circumstantial, and that the best working relationships are based largely on shared visions and philosophies. This <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/portfolios/448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chelsea gut renovation</a> project brought together Sweeten member firm Future Project, co-owned by Pedro Pachano and Ampara Vollert, who specialize in exploring theories of space and sensory discovery in their architecture, with an art collector client who wanted more than just a space to showcase her individual art pieces. The art-loving homeowner was looking for something that would act as a flexible framework for her entire collection and lifestyle.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The apartment&#8217;s original layout was made up of a number of smaller rooms that varied in floor height, which did not allow for two key aspects that the homeowner specified for her remodeled home: to be able to entertain large numbers of people, and to have significant wall space for her collected works.<span id="more-10514"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10516" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg" alt="01_living" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">By removing a series of interior walls, integrating a diffused lighting system that creates flattering light for the homeowner&#8217;s many dinner parties, and using wide plank, white washed maple flooring and continuous, white walls and surface planes, the renovated apartment can now be experienced as an expansive space that is punctuated with art and views of the city.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10517" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg" alt="02_kitchen-entrance" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, Pedro and Ampara created a similarly expansive yet more personalized experience by using materials that engage both the senses of vision and touch. Here, custom, white Corian cabinets create uniform planes which are even used to hide the appliances, and a nice plus is that the Corian panels are pleasant to the touch. Knowing the homeowner&#8217;s propensity to entertain, the Future Project team designed a custom cantilevered island. The island is topped with an ocean blue resin surface like the countertop and backsplash which creates visual depth in the space and “relaxes the eye.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10518" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg" alt="03_family" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10519" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg" alt="04_family-2" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Discovery&#8221; was a theme Future Project worked with in their design, and we love how they used this idea here in the den area with this unique paneled wall system. The polished Rosewood veneer panels open to reveal a series of interior spaces, each with its own color of polished lacquer paint and unique function. One door leads to a guest bathroom, another to a roll-out closet system, and the one above opens to a colorful custom bar installation by a contemporary artist.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10536" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg" alt="bath" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;s a peek into the guest bath, one of our favorite rooms in the apartment. This space features a custom vanity and shower construction made of grey Corian with mirrored edges which make for a unique, fragmented optical illusion.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10520" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg" alt="05_master-bath" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The master bathroom is equally blue and oceanic. The walls, floor and ceiling here are tiled in 1&#8243; <a href="https://www.glasstile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oceanside Tessera glass mosaic tiles</a>, and the vanity is custom in white Thassos marble.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10521" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg" alt="06_bedroom" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Because she entertains so frequently, the homeowner wanted the option of a guest room, but at the same time did not want to give up her home&#8217;s open, gallery-like quality. Pedro and Ampara came up with a smart solution to accommodate both needs with a custom sliding wall (for separation) and second bed that&#8217;s all stored beneath the master bed.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10522" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png" alt="08_double-wine-hallway" width="600" height="428" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">As if we needed any further proof, this homeowner&#8217;s wine closet is yet another testament to her hostessing skills &#8212; so, when&#8217;s the next party?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Great work and many thanks to Future Project&#8217;s Pedro and Ampara for sharing their work with us; we look forward to seeing more from these designers, soon!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">Last month, we shared the first-hand renovation</span> <a href="/2013/07/25/homeowner-guest-post-lisas-kitchen-renovation-pt-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story of Lisa Law</a><span style="color: #000000;">, a Brooklyn Heights homeowner who used theSweeten to update her crumbling kitchen, and today, we&#8217;re excited to share our 2nd homeowner guest post &#8212; coincidentally, this story also comes from a Brooklyn homeowner named Lisa who used theSweeten to renovate her kitchen! Lisa B., who works in the architecture &amp; interiors industry, and her husband Brian, a media studies professor &amp; author, had lived in their Kensington apartment for 8 years before taking the leap to renovate their kitchen. The couple</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted to Sweeten</a><span style="color: #000000;"> were matched with a Sweeten general contractor</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Today we have before &amp; afters of the transformed kitchen, along with Lisa&#8217;s insightful narrative on the new design and the process of making it happen.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9736 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/00b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-copy.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="256" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/00b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-copy.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/00b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-copy-300x128.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before renovating, our kitchen had its original, 1960s pine cabinets that were custom-built for the space, but had many layers of bad paint jobs and several of the doors didn&#8217;t close. We thought about trying to save them, but they were so solidly built that there was no way to cut them down to fit our new design plan. Plus, stripping all that paint off would have been a nightmare. The vinyl flooring was peeling, the wall oven didn&#8217;t work, the cooktop was barely functional and it was almost impossible to see what you were cooking since it was stuck in a corner under a metal hood. The countertops were horrible, fake woodgrain formica. When we first moved in, they were even worse &#8212; there was contact paper on them, which we were able to pull up, but we were disappointed with what we uncovered!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We needed a gut renovation! Everything had to go, down to the studs, which meant new drywall, ceilings, cabinets, fixtures, appliances, flooring, backsplash and lighting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9662 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-225x300.png 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I read about Sweeten a while ago in NYMag and kept it in the back of my mind because I knew we were going to renovate our kitchen. Although I worked in the interior design field, most of the contractors I knew were doing high-end renovations in Manhattan. I posted before pictures of my kitchen on the site and Sweeten introduced me via email to three contractors, all of whom I met with and who gave me estimates. They all seemed good, but as someone who knows about renovation, I appreciated that our contractor took extra time to really look at the kitchen, open up the cabinets, anticipate potential problems, and talk in depth about the process.<span id="more-9660"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9663 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="904" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-199x300.png 199w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-597x900.png 597w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Design / Style</strong></span></em>: Having worked as a design assistant for an architectural interior design firm, I got to see a lot of custom kitchens being made, usually with white millwork and cabinetry, which I really like &#8211; it&#8217;s clean and timeless.  I learned about a lot of interesting materials and fixtures, too, and my style leans towards a mix of mid-century modern and contemporary &#8212; definitely not ultra-modern.  Even though the building was built in 1961, the apartment has some nice, almost mid-century modern, details: a curved hallway soffit, hardwood floors, baseboard moldings, and a really neat custom pantry closet with separate compartments.  I wanted the kitchen to fit the era of the apartment and the building, but still be updated. I knew that I wanted high gloss, white cabinets and appliances in order to create a feeling of space, plus they are so much easier to clean.  The kitchen is small, so having simple lines and using materials in a way that make the space feel bigger were key factors in the design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m not afraid of dark or saturated colors, but you have to know how to use them. Using the dark navy color on the back wall was yet another way to create the illusion of space by making that wall disappear, or recede, into the background.  You also need to consider the light in the space when choosing a wall color, and sometimes the right color can be almost counter-intuitive.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s always difficult to do a gut renovation in an apartment. Living in a construction zone is messy and stressful, although Nick&#8217;s team did their best to keep the dust and debris to a minimum.  Of course, budget was a challenge. You have to think about what to spend your money on to get the most bang for your buck.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Flooring</strong></span></em>: I was so tempted to spend a lot on the flooring, but in a small space, it&#8217;s often not really worth it.  I decided on porcelain tile because of price point and durability, but finding one was tricky; there weren&#8217;t a lot of color options that would compliment my countertops, which I had already picked out. I finally found an Italian porcelain, which wasn&#8217;t expensive; I used a big 12&#8243; x 24&#8243; tile in a staggered brick pattern laid horizontally to give the illusion of width.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Cabinets</strong></span></em>: I knew that I wanted to buy the cabinets from Ikea, which is a great, budget-friendly, option. They are really well-made &#8212; much better than cabinets from the big box stores and even sometimes better than the ones you can get from custom cabinet dealers. Planning a kitchen from scratch is a challenge, and if you are buying cabinets from Ikea, you really need to have a good idea of what you want before you order, especially since the cabinets only come in a limited range of sizes. The designers there are helpful, but only up to a certain point. I had to think a lot about the functionality of the space, the flow, and the most efficient way to store everything. It helps to have a contractor who has installed Ikea cabinets before, and Nick knew what to expect. Nick was also great at coming up with custom solutions &#8212; when the new cabinets didn&#8217;t fit exactly how we wanted them, he created a modified, open cabinet so that we would still get the added storage. He also built a very sleek, custom radiator cover which can be easily removed to get to the radiator, if necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Appliances</strong></span></em>: Because it&#8217;s a small kitchen, I also needed to think about things like appliance door clearance &#8212; we wanted an integrated dishwasher next to the sink, and had to figure out where was best to install it in order to keep from disrupting the flow in the kitchen. Even figuring out which way the cabinet doors would open was important to plan out ahead of time.  Finding a counter-depth, 32&#8243; wide refrigerator in a smooth white finish was also a challenge. Europeans have the leg up on American manufacturers when it comes to smaller, apartment size appliances.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Gennadiy was incredibly prompt, fast, and had great ideas and attention to detail. The thing we valued most was that he was very respectful of our budget, but at the same time shared our commitment to using high-quality materials. He was a great guide in knowing where to spend versus save.&#8221;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211;Sarah, Upper East Side Homeowner</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9136 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/01-b_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg" alt="modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/01-b_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/01-b_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/01-b_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sarah, an editor at Vanity Fair, &amp; her husband Michael, a reporter for Bloomberg News, purchased their first home in the Upper East Side late last year. Almost immediately, the enterprising young journalists set out to make an important update to the space; the two love to cook, eat, &amp; entertain, but since their apartment, c. 1910, had very few updates made to it in the last 100 years, renovating the kitchen was top priority. Sarah &amp; Michael knew what they wanted for the new space, taking a direction rooted in the age &amp; tradition of the original home, rather than any Jetsonian ideal. So, with her own catalog of inspired ideas and a well-researched execution plan, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1599" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah posted to Sweeten</a> to find the perfect contractor for the work. From their matches, the couple chose to work with tS member Gennadiy Kaliberda, owner of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">South Fork Projects</a>. The charming new kitchen is a perfect model for the 21st C., traditional home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9137 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-befores.jpg" alt="modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation" width="600" height="721" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-befores.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-befores-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the original kitchen had charming bones, the space was overwhelmed by warm, reddish wooden cabinets &amp; trim that made it feel dark &amp; dingy, and a full set of outdated appliances added to the overall drabness. Sarah &amp; Michael appreciated the traditional character that runs throughout the entire home, so they planned for a makeover that would not undermine the spirit of the architecture. After much deliberation, the sensible solution was to paint their existing cabinets.<span id="more-9040"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;The lower cabinets were high-varnish, auburn-colored oak—all contemporary, not original. Though they &#8216;clashed&#8217; in age with the old wood, they had the upside of being on new drawer tracks and in great condition. The upper cabinets, the hutch cabinet, and the dark hardware were original to the apartment, circa 1910, and their functionality (on new hinges) was fantastic, but they were riddled with wood putty spots and pockmarks from a century of use.&#8221; </span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9138 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/03_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-durings.jpg" alt="modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation" width="600" height="721" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/03_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-durings.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/03_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-durings-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to connecting with Gennadiy, the homeowners independently sourced &amp; replaced the appliances and hired a painter who specializes in historic interiors for the cabinet painting. To transition the warm wooden scheme into something more modern feeling, that would also blend well with the addition of stainless steel appliances, the couple chose a light cool grey paint, <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/redirects/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=coolbreeze&#038;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BM Cool Breeze</a>. Sarah&#8217;s favorite element &#8212; and a worthwhile splurge alongside the economic cabinet update &#8212; is the range. The <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com/cgi-bin/ajmadison/H304GGVCR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bertazzoni Heritage Series in Matte Cream</a> fits perfectly as a modern throwback to an earlier tradition. At this stage, the homeowners were ready to move forward with Gennadiy for their countertop, sink, backsplash &amp; cabinet replacement glass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9139 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/04_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg" alt="modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/04_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/04_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The completed space is bright, cozy, and almost pastoral, with a balanced palette of warm and cool. The new palette was inspired partially by a similar scheme Sarah had come across in a book of Scottish country houses.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Overall, the inspiration was as much outdoors as in—I kept thinking of a kitchen you could imagine being right off of a sprawling herb or vegetable garden. Maybe if Beatrix Potter had a New York pied-a-terre.&#8221;</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9140 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/05_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg" alt="modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/05_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/05_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most inventive elements of the new design is the use of antiqued mirror panels in place of the former, contemporary set in frosted glass. This suggestion came from Sarah&#8217;s aunt as a way to increase the natural light in the space, but it also ties in perfectly with the vintage theme. Sarah sourced custom-cut, 12&#8243;x12&#8243; mirror-glass panels in &#8216;French Antique&#8217; finish from <a href="https://www.antiquemirrorglassshoppe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timeless Reflections</a>. After installing the glass panels, Gennadiy sealed on &amp; painted wooden backings inside the cabinet doors to create a solid, clean construction. For the backsplash, Sarah &amp; Michael re-routed their initial plan to use wainscoting, and instead selected a classic-looking carrera marble subway tile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9141 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/06_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg" alt="modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/06_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/06_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finding a farm sink that would work well in the space proved to be the biggest challenge of the renovation, but, determined to find exactly what she was looking for, Sarah eventually lucked out with the last one available &#8212; perhaps, anywhere. A bridge <a href="https://rohlhome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faucet from Rohl&#8217;s Country Kitchen collection</a> completes the sink basin&#8217;s farmhouse look, and for the countertops, the homeowners chose Brazilian soapstone, fabricated by <a href="https://www.soapstones.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M. Teixeira</a>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Gennadiy and I worked like dogs to find a fireclay farm sink that would work for a New York apartment kitchen. They’re so heavy and so huge—most are 30 inches wide and 10 inches deep, which would swallow the entire counter—that we had to really scour for one small enough, shallow enough, and with the clean, traditional shape that I wanted.  This was the sole one that would work and, coincidentally, the very last one in a showroom I called. Even in its diminutive (by farm sink-standards) size, we still had to opt for an upmount to clear the plumbing and keep the top drawer functional.  I actually like the look of it better this way—it makes more of a pronounced statement.&#8221;</span></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We love the antique, marble &amp; iron garden table from Italy, which Sarah purchased through a <a href="https://www.potomackcompany.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Potomack Company</a> auction. On the hutch cabinets, chicken wire &amp; custom toile curtains give subtle suggestions of being out in the European countryside.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Rather than painting the doors &amp; transoms above, these wooden surfaces are left intact &#8212; the new contrast makes them more pronounced than ever before.</p>
<h2>&#8220;[Gennadiy] works really well with young clients because he’s tech-savvy and good with communication. He’d be picture-messaging me close-ups of the veining on my marble tile from the showrooms so we could discuss it, or sending me daily photo updates—we never felt that dreaded feeling of wondering why our contractor’d gone AWOL, ever.&#8221;</h2>
<p>We love the new space and admire Sarah &amp; Michael&#8217;s sharp planning and great eye for detail &#8212; awesome work to Gennadiy, and many thanks to the happy homeowners for sharing!</p>
