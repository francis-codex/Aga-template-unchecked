			<h2>The punch list is a final, crucial step of a renovation. Here&#8217;s how they work.</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-08.jpg" alt="Kitchen island with white countertops and seating for two" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52014" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A punch list is a list of tasks put together by a homeowner that needs to be completed by their contractor. </span><span class="s2">The punch list needs to be done for the project to be completely done. The majority of the work has been finished, but there are details to be resolved. You have one shot to compile your punch list, and once it is completed, the project is officially done!</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">What goes on a punch list?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It depends who you ask! This question is often a misunderstanding between a homeowner and a contractor. In construction, there are acceptable quality standards, which are in the form of building codes. <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Licensed contractors are responsible</a> for abiding by these codes. When a project passes inspection by the codes enforcement official, some contractors consider their work completed. Building codes exist to ensure an acceptable level of quality and ensure that the home is structurally sound. Reputable general contractors will not only meet, but exceed this benchmark.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The goal of a punch list is to address concerns the homeowner may have after inspecting a project. For example, a crooked hinge on a kitchen cabinet door would normally indicate a defect and should appear on your list. Clashing paint colors, however, are usually not the responsibility of the painter, and would not indicate a defect. Even so, the situation needs correcting. Add these concerns to your punch list. You and your contractor will discuss if the task will be fixed by them or the subcontractor. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How do I start a punch list?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To start a punch list, the easiest way is to have paper and pencil in each room. Notes stay organized and prevent several lists from being created for the same room. Many new homeowners prefer to live in the space for a while. They can relax and use the space in a daily routine. This makes identifying any issues easier. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">When does a rolling punch list happen?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Traditionally, final payment is paid to the contractor at project completion. A walk-through and a punch list happen after the final payment. As any concerns are addressed, the general contractor will often either discuss the concern or agree to correct the issue. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An alternative punch list solution is referred to as a &#8220;rolling punch list&#8221;, or a punch list-as-you-go. Instead of inspecting all of the details at the end, the general contractor makes periodic walk-throughs with the homeowner. As concerns are addressed, everyone involved takes a role in resolving the issue. If the subcontractor is still onsite with labor, machines, and materials, it is easier to correct a concern.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before a project starts, the homeowner and contractor should confirm when the punch list will take place. Each general contractor has their own process for handling punch list items. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">What is the difference between a tweak and a defect?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This question is really at the heart of a punch list. During installation, an issue such as a crooked cabinet hinge will raise concerns immediately for a homeowner. Contractors tend to focus on completing the project even if small adjustments will be required later on. A homeowner may view the crooked cabinet door as a lack of skill or professional ethics.</span><span class="s1"> Have an open dialog between the general contractor and homeowner, so both parties can ask questions and set realistic expectations. Ideally, this discussion will be frequent and ongoing throughout the project so that confusion and assumptions are kept to a minimum.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are working with a Sweeten contractor, a homeowner may also reach out to Sweeten customer support with questions or clarifications. Email ClientServices@sweeten.com.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Be communicative and flexible</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A punch list should be considered a place to answer questions and get questions answered. For the experienced contractor, the positive completion of a punch list is their business card. For a homeowner, it can confirm they are working with a professional.</span></p>
<h3>Finding a true partner in your general contractor</h3>

<p><span class="s1"></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">When do you need permits to remodel a bathroom?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to understand why homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choose to remodel their bathrooms</a> making it one of the most popular home renovation projects. We demand a lot from our bathrooms! In turn, upgrading to space-efficient tubs, <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/renovators-converted-tubs-to-showers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tub-to-shower conversions</a>, faucets, and toilets make daily life better. Building codes, however, dictate how far you can go with changes before requiring a permit. Here, we answer a common question on homeowners&#8217; minds: Do you need permits to remodel a bathroom?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The short answer is, to start the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process of upgrading your bathroom</a>, you usually need permits. When you make changes to plumbing, electrical, or structural components of your home, you need a permit from the Department of Buildings. However, small aesthetic changes, like painting rooms, repairing plaster, or refinishing floors do not require a permit. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s2">Bathroom remodeling permits for: Minor plumbing projects</span><span class="s1"> </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can make minor plumbing changes without a permit for a bathroom remodel. However, requirements vary between cities and counties across the country. For example, according to the New York City <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/property-or-business-owner/plumbing-permits.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s3">Department of Buildings</span></a>: </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Simple repairs or direct replacement of existing faucets or fixtures such as toilets and sinks are considered cosmetic work and do not require a permit. Direct replacement involves work that does not alter or change the fixture&#8217;s hot and cold water shutoff valves or fixture trap.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So for plumbing, leave the valves and trap alone when you replace a faucet and you don’t need a permit. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s2">Bathroom remodeling permits for: </span><span class="s2">Minor electrical projects</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In contrast, minor electrical work in a bathroom remodel usually requires a permit. According to the DOB again:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">“An electrical permit is required for most electrical work, including handling of electrical wires that is performed in a residential home or business.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, you can do simple repairs and fixture replacement without a permit for plumbing, but not for electrical work. Beyond that, it’s considered remodeling; so you’ll be dealing with permits, professionals, and more complexity. Don’t worry, though, as it’s a clear<span>—</span>if slow<span>—</span>process. The secret is to work with professionals who know what they’re doing. We can connect you with vetted and licensed <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors who are up-to-date with local code and regulations. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Building codes by county</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In other places in the U.S., you’ll have to research your local requirements for bathroom remodeling permits. You’ll find counties that have not adopted a specific building code but do require a permit and inspection for some types of work, like septic systems, plumbing, and electrical. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This scenario can be somewhat opaque, so do preliminary research on local building websites before talking with your contractor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, updates to these regulations don’t happen regularly on their websites</span><span class="s1">, and that holds true for official websites, too. Therefore, you’ll get the latest information from the people who deal with these issues regularly<span>—general contractors</span>.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jonathan-Bath-01.jpg" alt="blue bathroom with washer dryer" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56410" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jonathan-Bath-01.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jonathan-Bath-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jonathan-Bath-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) A Sweeten general contractor helped Ashleigh and Jonathan navigate their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/washer-dryer-bathroom-renovation-dumbo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom permits</a> on a tight timeline.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Navigating bathroom remodel permits</span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Filing permits for a bathroom remodel </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For our purposes here, bathroom remodeling involves a new bathtub and/or shower, new toilet, and new sink, which may be freestanding or in cabinetry. It is common for many partial to full renovations to start with simple changes, like a new faucet or new flooring. The scope then grows when people realize they really dislike that bathroom and they don’t need to live with it any longer. As a result, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-national-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget for the project</a> and permit fees need to be adjusted. In Sweeten homeowners, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/apartment-bathroom-remodel-in-hoboken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda and Bob&#8217;s bathroom remodel</a>, their plumbing stayed in the same places but they did add a second sink. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With any remodeling project, you should create a plan. This is where you decide <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who to hire for your renovation team</a>. For a project with any layout changes, whether they&#8217;re plumbing or electrical changes or not, you’ll need to work with a registered architect or a professional engineer. Those pros are referred to as the Registered Design Professional. They will file the permit application as the Applicant of Record with the <span class="s3">Department of Buildings</span> and ensure that the project meets requirements. You’ll need patience for this, as it’s common for your permit application to take 2-6 months for approval. It could take longer, depending on the extent of work and the building. Historic buildings add another layer of complexity. </span></p>
<h4>Working with home associations &amp; condos</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Homeowners/condo/building associations may have a policy that requires an alteration agreement for work on your home. Moving forward will require paperwork to be submitted and approved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Those associations usually have extensive oversight of the building and will review and approve or deny your plans. They may have their own architect or other experts review your plan. They’ll also want to confirm your insurance coverage and make sure you have a licensed contractor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition, you may not be allowed to make major layout changes. Most building designs have “wet” spaces with plumbing “stacked” from floor to floor. For instance, a toilet drain will not be located above your downstairs neighbor’s bedroom. The plumbing system is also vented, and is typically constructed as a system within the entire building. Subsequently, any modifications must work within that system. Again, your architect or contractor should advise on what’s possible. Work with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted, licensed general contractor</a> to avoid headaches (and a lot of back-and-forth.)</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Behind-the-scenes in a bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A licensed contractor should handle the remodeling work in your bathroom. They will have the professional contacts for subcontractors in the plumbing and electrical field. These professionals handle tasks like wiring, laying and grouting tile, and more. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The extent of work involved varies dramatically depending on the condition and layout of your home compared to what you want to achieve. The easiest changes involve the sink and faucet. Even with some plumbing changes, you’re not looking at tearing up a lot of the room and rebuilding. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Changing the location of the toilet, bathtub, or shower becomes much more complicated. Supply lines for water run through the walls or the floor/ceiling, but drains have to fit into the floor space and then join the plumbing “stack” in the wall. This is the combination drain and vent system. Changes to these parts can involve a lot of destruction before anything new can be installed. Bidets<span>—</span>an increasingly popular addition in recent years<span>—</span>will need a drain and supply lines. This type of work is routine for a seasoned plumber but definitely must be done with care.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After the toilet, replacing an existing bathtub can be hard work, but is typically straightforward if you&#8217;re able to reuse the existing drain and supply lines. Changing from a bathtub to a tub/shower or to a walk-in shower becomes slightly more complex, but not substantially. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Where to start a bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you want to renovate your bathroom, be sure to find the right general contractor who understands your vision<span>—and can build the type of bathroom you want</span>. During a site visit, they&#8217;ll help you discover ideal design features for your space, and will be invaluable in assisting with the permit process. </span><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with Sweeten to renovate</a><span class="s2"> with the best contractors</span>.</span></p>

Small aesthetic changes, like painting rooms, repairing plaster, or refinishing floors do not require a permit. If the plumbing valves and trap remain intact when replacing a faucet, you don’t need a permit. When it comes to electrical, however, even minor electrical work needs a permit. Check with your local DOB office since requirements can vary between cities and counties across the country.</span></p></div>

However, check with local DOB offices as requirements vary between cities and counties across the country. Simple repairs or direct replacement of existing faucets or fixtures such as toilets, shower fixtures, and sinks are considered cosmetic work and do not require a permit. A direct bathroom vanity swap with no plumbing being relocated will not require a permit.</span></p></div>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN_Nazli_Master_Lounge-Before-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34966 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Planning a renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN_Nazli_Master_Lounge-Before-12-723x482.jpg" alt="starting a renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN_Nazli_Master_Lounge-Before-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN_Nazli_Master_Lounge-Before-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN_Nazli_Master_Lounge-Before-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN_Nazli_Master_Lounge-Before-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation process has many layers, but understanding your goals and how to prepare for them is the first step. Having a clear scope and budget when you’re ready to find the right contractor is a good position to be in. Here, we offer a guide on how to plan a home renovation and set yourself up for success from start to finish.</p>
<h3>1. Choose your renovation “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves”</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners renovate for many reasons—you just bought a new space that needs a refresh (or a gut!), your family is growing or you’d like to downsize, a repair is needed and a long-awaited renovation makes sense now, or maybe what you have just isn’t working for you. Whatever the reason driving the decision, the first step for any major renovation is crucial: identify the “must-have” elements for your home. Have an idea of what’s definitively required and you will be better equipped to have an informed conversation when the time comes to meet with general contractors and architects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Equally important is making a wishlist of “nice-to-haves.” This includes all of the changes you’d like to see, but would be willing to forgo due to budget limitations. In tandem with determining the “must-haves” and the “nice-to-haves,” decide the exact space(s) you are renovating, and what kind of updates (cosmetic, gut, layout changes, etc.), you plan to make. While a cosmetic update would not involve any layout changes or moving of plumbing and/or electrical, a gut renovation means demolishing the existing space down to the studs, and rebuilding the entire interior floor-to-ceiling.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">2. Determine who to hire for your renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have your list of “must-haves,” you’ll have a better sense of what type of expert you’ll need for your renovation. Depending on what you’re planning to do, you’ll want to meet with different types of experts.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">When to work with <strong>general contractors</strong>:</h4>
<ul>
<li>removing or replacing finishes but generally keeping things in the same place</li>
<li>comfortable selecting fixtures and finishes yourself</li>
<li>ready to start construction</li>
</ul>
<h4>When to work with an <strong>architect and a general contractor, or a design-build firm:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>making major layout or structural changes</li>
<li>moving plumbing or gas lines</li>
<li>renovating a landmark property</li>
<li>looking for professional design help</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While many general contractors can provide general guidance when it comes to selecting fixtures and finishes, you may also want to hire an interior designer if you want more extensive help creating your ideal space. Most <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors can refer you to an architect they&#8217;ve done work with if their services are required. If it looks like you’ll need an architect for your renovation, you may be able to hire a design-build firm to help as a one-stop shop. As the name suggests, this type of firm takes care of the design as well as the construction phase of a project. Some lean more design-forward while others are construction-forward. Interview a few to see what you feel comfortable with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tip:</strong> When you post your renovation to find a general contractor, we’ll match you with GCs and design-build firms best suited to your project.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3. Research the cost of your renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is always the tough part—figuring out how much money you’ll need for the renovation. How much should you spend? How much do you have to spend? As a starting point, we have seen the average cost to renovate <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an entire home</a> typically between $80 to $200 per square foot. The price can vary from room to room, as <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen upgrades</a> and bathrooms tend to be more expensive and bedrooms and living rooms cost less. Costs also vary based on geographical location.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47677 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kitchen-Split-1.jpg" alt="how long does a kitchen remodel take" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kitchen-Split-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kitchen-Split-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kitchen-Split-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-kitchen-renovation-take-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to read how long it takes to remodel a kitchen</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s break it down: you’ll need to consider the cost of labor, materials, and finishes, plus associated fees like city permits, board approvals, and/or design fees. If you plan to hire a designer and/or an architect, account for the fact that both charge a percentage (ranging from 5 to 20 percent of project costs) for their fee.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Costs for remodeling materials and finishes</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Understandably, many people focus on the visible aspects of the renovation—the materials and finishes—which, depending on whether you choose budget, mid-, or high-end products, will account typically for 50 percent or less of the full cost of the renovation. The good news is that this is the first step to understanding what kind of renovation you’ll be able to afford; take a look at various retailers and websites to see how much that Moroccan tile costs per square foot. An efficient way to do this is to list the materials you’d like to include, and price out all the materials in a spreadsheet.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> See our <a href="https://sweeten.com/remodeling-cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation cost guides</a> for city-level cost estimates.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Costs for remodeling labor</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, you’ll want to account for the cost of labor. As each firm is different, the best way to do this is to meet with general contractors to get a sense of how much their labor costs will run. There are many variables; in the busy summer season, for example, labor tends to be more expensive than during the winter months. They will also assess your specific job site. If you live in a co-op building with difficult street parking, plus strict rules governing the renovation itself in terms of allowable work hours and protection of the common areas, labor will be costlier than in a standalone house where the contractor has more freedom to park in the driveway and work around the clock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take into consideration wet areas like <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom redesigns</a> or kitchens cost more to renovate than dry spaces (for example, dining rooms and bedrooms) due to materials and labor that may be more complex. The type of finishes you choose will also affect costs. Mosaic tilework and woodworking will require labor with specialized skills compared to basic installations such as subway tile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you live in a condo or co-op, knowing the specific rules governing your building <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">before setting up for a site visit</a> allows your contractor to provide a more accurate bid.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37982 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> (<em>Above</em>) <span class="s1">A <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/clinton-hill-experienced-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whole-home renovation</a> with an open kitchen, skim-coated walls, and new closets</span></p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extra fees for remodeling</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The associated fees that come with renovating are often overlooked. Most city or town permits come with a price tag, and if you live in a co-op or condo, review your building’s alteration agreement/documentation to determine if there are extra costs, such as an engineer mandated by the building to approve your plans.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Budget for contingencies</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, leave a 10% cushion for unexpected costs. Even the best-laid plans sometimes go awry or need tweaking, and that safety net will ensure that you’re not venturing into uncomfortable territory if your renovation costs exceed your budget.</p>
<h3>4. Find the best general contractor or architect for your renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Experts are not necessarily hard to find; the tricky part is <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding the right one</a> for your renovation and communication style. Asking friends or searching through directories can yield many suggestions, but those general contractors may not be the right fit for your specific budget, your location, or your type of project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That’s where our free service comes in. We help you find the best general contractor for your project, then monitor the project until completion. By posting your project, you’ll be matched with general contractors who are:</p>
<ul>
<li>licensed, insured, and vetted</li>
<li>have experience with renovations like yours</li>
<li>do work in your city, town, or neighborhood</li>
<li>are already interested in your project based on its budget and scope</li>
<li>guarantee their work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Read about <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how our free service works</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Get at least 3 estimates to compare</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with most things in life, you should shop around a little. As a general rule, it’s smart to have at least three bids, (also known as estimates) from different general contractors for your renovation. Not only will this allow you to find the best contractor for your budget, but you’ll be able to find the “right fit” in terms of working style and personality.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Bids often come in different formats from different contractors. We offer a free <a href="https://sweeten.com/bid-leveling-call-for-renovation-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid-leveling phone call</a> with our renovation experts to help analyze any bids you&#8217;ve received from Sweeten contractors as well as outside firms. We&#8217;ll also offer insight into Sweeten contractors and their communication style.</p>
<h3>6. Choose the best general contractor for you and start renovating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have met with all of the candidates, reviewed bids, discussed them with your spouse, partner, or housemates (and maybe Sweeten!) and decided on the best option, it’s time to sign the contract. At this point, you will typically pay a percentage (25 to 50 percent, depending on the length and overall budget of the project) upfront. The contract will also set up regular intervals and milestones at which future payments are due.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, it’s time for the fun to begin! Knowing how to plan your renovation successfully means starting with this basic list, and, when you’re ready, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posting your project to find a contractor</a>.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">You&#8217;ve decided to renovate after assessing your home and how you want to live in it. But where do you start? From pre-planning to punch list, we break down the process with a renovation checklist. You&#8217;ll find the basics of the renovation process, along with tips and tricks to a successful project.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Renovating a house checklist: Pre-renovation</span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">1. Set your home renovation goals and determine your budget</span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Write down what&#8217;s motivating your renovation. List the problems you&#8217;d like to solve, and how you&#8217;ll feel when your renovation is successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Assess your budget &#8211; </strong></span><span style="color: #333333;">Make sure you know what you want to spend and what you have budgeted for the project.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Answer &#8211; <em>What&#8217;s motivating my renovation? </em></strong>An example of e</span><span style="color: #333333;">motional motivation might be,</span><span style="color: #333333;"> <em>&#8220;My <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen feels old</a> and cramped. Instead, I want my kitchen to fit my personality and lifestyle.&#8221; </em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Answer &#8211; <em>What problems do I want to solve? </em></strong>T</span><span style="color: #333333;">echnical motivations could be,</span><span style="color: #333333;"> <em>&#8220;The kitchen is laid out poorly, falling apart, and hard to cook in.&#8221;</em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Answer &#8211; <em>What does a successful renovation feel like?</em> </strong></span><span style="color: #333333;">Your response might be something like,<em> &#8220;Success is a beautiful, organized kitchen with more storage and work surfaces.&#8221; </em>Or, <em>&#8220;A reconfigured layout gave us better flow between spaces and maximized the square footage.&#8221; </em></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read on <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/sweeten-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our blog</a> the many motivations that <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> homeowners had when they started their renovations.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">2. Identify your renovation &#8220;must-haves&#8221; and &#8220;nice-to-haves&#8221;</span></h4>
<ol></ol>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Make a full list of tasks, from the floor to the ceiling. Determine your &#8220;must-haves&#8221;; they are the reasons you are renovating. These are the items that must be checked off your renovation checklist before the project is considered complete.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Then, write a &#8220;nice-to-have&#8221; list. These are items that you&#8217;re willing to give up if there are budget constraints. (Also, understand that sometimes in order to fit a &#8220;must-have,&#8221; you might have to give up a &#8220;nice-to-have.&#8221;)</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">3. Select your renovation team</span></h4>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">If you are knocking down walls, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving bathroom plumbing</a> or gas lines, or doing work on a landmark property, you&#8217;ll need to hire an architect as well as a general contractor. Your Sweeten contractor can recommend architects if their services are needed.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Schedule site visits with a shortlist of professionals you like best </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Review bids and reduce <a href="https://sweeten.com/remodeling-cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget costs</a> if necessary by letting go of items not on your &#8220;must-have&#8221; list</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Our guide <em><a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Who do I hire for my renovation?</a></em> can help you determine which experts you&#8217;ll need.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">4. Communication and paperwork</span></h4>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Determine a communication <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan with your contractor</a>—mode and frequency—and include it in your contract</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Review payment methods and schedule milestones tied to payments. Include these in your contract</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Set a 10%–20% cushion in the budget for unknowns</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Check your building&#8217;s alteration agreement if you live in an apartment; see what the renovation &#8220;rules&#8221; are</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Update your home insurance policy</span></li>
</ul>
<ol></ol>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">5. Practical considerations</span></h4>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Consider moving out during a renovation if you have children or if anyone in the household has health or mobility issues</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">If you&#8217;re staying, give some thought to where you will cook, eat, shower, and sleep</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Minimize the mess: cover furniture and shelves; use plastic wrap to contain dust from entering the rest of the home; use humidifiers to keep dust from spreading</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Renovating a house checklist:</span><span style="color: #333333;"><strong style="text-align: center;"> During the renovation</strong></span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">6. Schedule and conduct calendar check-ins with your contractor</span></h4>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Set aside a least 5 hours/week as early in the process as possible. Coordinate with <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your contractor to order fixtures</a>, appliances, and other materials. Be aware of items with long lead times. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Get ready for A LOT of detailed questions on such things as electrical outlet locations, height of shower head and lighting, the direction doors should swing open, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">7. Compile your renovation punch list</span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>Million Dollar Contractor</em> Stephen Fanuka has great advice for final walk-throughs: &#8220;At the end of the reno, place a notepad in each renovated space. Don&#8217;t communicate with your contractor for two weeks. During that time, live in the space and jot down anything you notice needs adjusting or fixing. That&#8217;s your punch list.&#8221; Your contractor should come back and review the punch list with you. Their team will then address the outstanding items on the punch list.</span></p>
