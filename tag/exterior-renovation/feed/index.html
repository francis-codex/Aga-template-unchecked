										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Rich color and a tweaked façade for a Queens house</h2>
<p><em>Gary, a scientist, and his husband lived in their humble home in the New York City borough of Queens for ten years before they found the nerve to move on their exterior renovation. “We always knew we wanted to do it but we were intimidated,” he says. “We didn’t know where to start.” The partners summoned the strength to tackle the much-needed work, then <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/29899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors. Soon, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4112#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the contractors they chose</a> had a plan to transform the not-so-pretty home to one with serious curb appeal.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gary-Hunnicutt-Home-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41289 size-full" title="exterior-of-two-storey-house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gary-Hunnicutt-Home-05.jpg" alt="exterior of small two storey house with light green vinyl sliding and landscaped front yard after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gary-Hunnicutt-Home-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gary-Hunnicutt-Home-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gary-Hunnicutt-Home-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>The truth is, when I called Sweeten and their Client Services said, “It sounds like you need a GC,” I didn’t even know what that was. This is our first home, purchased a decade ago. Over the years, we’d done what we could on our own, but we knew it needed more TLC than we could manage. We had hired handy people for patches. We’d had poor experiences, and those incidents made us gun-shy. We knew the house needed serious renovation work, but we had no idea how it would be done or what the cost might be. We were terrified.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gary-Hunnicutt-Home-01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41290 size-full" title="two-storey-exterior-of-house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gary-Hunnicutt-Home-01-1.jpg" alt="exterior of small two storey house with olive green vinyl sliding after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gary-Hunnicutt-Home-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gary-Hunnicutt-Home-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gary-Hunnicutt-Home-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Our home is a freestanding, wood-framed, single-family structure in Queens. It’s only 16 feet wide and 36 feet long, with postage-stamp front- and backyards. One of our friends, when visiting for the first time, christened it, “The Tardis.” It reminded him of the time machine on that old British sci-fi show Dr. Who, because it looks bigger on the inside than it does from the street. The house has a basement; a first floor with a living room, dining room, and kitchen; a second floor with three bedrooms and a bathroom; and an unfinished attic. The square footage is about 1,600 with a finished basement or 1,100 square feet without. Built in the 1920s, the house was of a popular style—there are thousands like it in Queens.</p>
<p>We have a 1939 tax photo of the place, given to us as a housewarming gift, and since we received it, we’d wanted to revise the exterior to resemble the original. We’d driven around and looked at a lot of houses in the neighborhood, noting styles and features that we felt worked nicely, and those we knew did not. The homes around us have great potential, but many lost their souls during the vinyl-siding cataclysm of the 1970s and ‘80s.</p>

It also had “yankee” gutters—U-shaped troughs built right into the roof—that would spill over and direct water down the sides of the house. So the first phase of the project was to replace the bad roofing with new shingles and install hanging gutters, which we hoped would resolve the leaking issues. We chose black shingles and black gutters to match, and the job was a relative snap that made a huge difference inside and out.</p>

<p>Next up was to remove the old vinyl siding. We would upgrade the windows and place insulation in the walls, since the house had previously had none, before installing new siding. The front of the house had a bow window that was oddly tall, and did not jive with the eyeline of the door, giving the house a disjointed look. We had it removed and replaced with a window that is a better fit and gives the facade cleaner lines.</p>

We’d read about a technique of using more than one color to visually augment a home’s gables, so we decided on three-toned siding and used an online visualization tool to try out combinations of bold, saturated colors. Once we’d agreed on a palette, we got paint samples and tested the colors on large, flat surfaces. We finally choose our barn brown reds, along with a sage green.</p>
<p>Having committed to our colors, we needed to decide on the style and surface texture of our siding.  We wanted a wood look and had heard we could get that with cement-fiber siding; we appreciated the product’s appearance and durability, and also that we could paint over it if we didn’t like our long-debated hues. We decided to add dimension and offset the house’s gables with shakes, a sort of shingle that is thicker and split, not sawn, in the brown-red color.</p>
<p>Figuring out a trim color was next. With the black shingles, gutters and windows, we were afraid more black would be too heavy. We decided to stick with it for the main lines of the house but went with gray trim around the windows and doors. The storm door is black but our front door is a rich burgundy that pops and says, “Welcome.” In honor of our house’s Tardis-like qualities, we painted the back door in Police Box Blue.</p>

Our Sweeten contractor, who has been doing these jobs a long time, was great. We picked his brain and expertise and took many of his suggestions with no regrets. He was accessible, coming by multiple times a week to check on the progress. We never needed backup, but we liked knowing that Sweeten’s Client Services team was there. There were times when our vision failed us, but our contractor gave us good advice: If you aren’t happy with something, stop and have it done right. It was a challenge to believe that the mess would eventually yield success. But it did.</p>
<p>A few neighbors have been open in expressing their dislike of our home’s new look, but they are a minority. We focus on the many people who’ve gone out of their way to say they love it. One neighbor, who is friends with the director of Project Runway, told us that when the friend visited, he said our house was “amazing.” That really tickled us and made me sure that what we did, we did just right.</p>

<h3><strong>Should You Remodel for Resale?</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re moving sooner rather than later, your renovation should be strategic and targeted in the areas that will create the biggest difference to buyers with minimal cost to you. Walk around your home with your real estate agent and discuss whether there are any basic improvement projects that might facilitate a quick sale for top dollar. While decluttering and staging should be the first steps, some homes do need some extra work. If yours falls into this category, <b>ask yourself the following questions:</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Am I willing to accept a lower price per square foot to compensate for the condition of the home?</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Am I scared off by the hassle of a renovation project?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If your answer to both questions is no, it sounds like a renovation might be in your future!</p>
<h3>Renovating for resale: Apartments</h3>
<p>If you live in an apartment, there is usually another entity—a co-op or condo board—in conjunction with a management company, who is responsible for the upkeep of the building systems and its exterior, as well as any landscaping. Neither you nor the buyer of your apartment will need to deal with these issues personally (unless you’re on the board, but that’s a whole different story.) As an owner, you’re responsible for “walls-in,” so it makes sense to focus on cosmetic improvements that will help your apartment show better.</p>
<h3>Renovating for resale: Houses</h3>
<p>The priorities are different when renovating a house for resale. Since homeowners are responsible for the whole building and the lot on which the house sits, there will likely be more pressing concerns beyond the color of the bedroom walls. (Also, buyers of townhouses generally expect to do some work on their new homes after closing.) This means that your money shouldn’t go to renovations but to repairs: ensuring that all systems are in good working order, that there are no structural issues, and that nothing on the exterior needs immediate attention.</p>
<p>You’ll generally have to dig deeper into your pockets to fund these types of projects, but it’s likely that your house will sit on the market if you don’t address them. If you don’t deal with pressing repairs, and they come up during inspection, expect the buyer to ask for credits at closing in order to compensate for them.</p>
<h3><span class="s1">The best interior </span><span class="s1">home upgrades for </span><span class="s1">resale value</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A tip: Focus your time and money on remodeling the most visible parts of your home. This approach tends to bring the best value (we’ll address exterior updates further down.) These are the interior, whole-room projects that recoup the most home resale value according to <i>Remodeling’</i>s 2020 <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value Report</span></a>:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range, minor kitchen remodel that costs $23,452 has a resale value of $18,206 and recoups <b>77%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range, major kitchen remodel that costs $68,490 has a resale value of $40,127 and recoups <b>58%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range bathroom remodel that costs $21,377 has a resale value of $13,688 and recoups<b> 64%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">An upscale bathroom remodel that costs $67,106 has a resale value of $37,995 and recoups <b>56%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range bathroom addition that costs $49,598 has a resale value of $26,807 and recoups<b> 54%</b></span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Small </span><span class="s1">home resale upgrades</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Add a fresh coat of paint. </b>Especially if the current colors are very bright or unusual. You might love lime green, but it’s safe to say that many buyers won’t. Many homeowners can repaint themselves, but sometimes, it’s worth calling in the pros.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Change out kitchen cabinet fronts.</b> You can do this in a few different ways—simply sanding and repainting the existing surface is the most budget-friendly, or you can choose to replace the doors and hardware while leaving the interior boxes in place. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Swap out your fixtures.</b>  If your lighting and plumbing fixtures look like they are from the ’80s—and not in a good way—consider switching them out. You don’t need to go high-end; there are plenty of good-looking options at big box stores. Our suggestion? Pick something with clean lines and classic finishes. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Refinish your floors.</b> If they are scratched, peeling, or look damaged, this is a must. Any sign of water damage, for example, is not only an aesthetic problem but is also an indicator to buyers that there may be a history of leaks in the building. And if you have carpets…this is a huge turnoff for many buyers, so consider replacing them.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Rip out outdated trends that serve no function</b>. This applies to vinyl faux-wood paneling, weird glass block walls, and “decorative” room dividers that are now just eyesores.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Single-space </span><span class="s1">home upgrades</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Kitchen updates.</b> This is an important room for buyers and is often immediately visible upon entering an apartment, so you’ll want to focus your attention here. In addition to refurbishing the cabinet doors, replace the hardware and fixtures. You can also go further and replace the countertops and backsplash. Visually, these make the biggest impact. If you have a very dark kitchen, going lighter will appeal to buyers.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Bathroom updates. </b>After the kitchen, this is the most important space in an apartment. Particularly if there is just one—it’s important to make it look functional and clean. The easiest and most affordable ways to update the bath are to paint and change out the medicine cabinet mirror for an updated model. Updating the tile, vanity, and reglazing the tub will also be good ways to freshen up the space.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>“Flex space” addition</b>. While it’s impossible to add actual square footage to an apartment (unless you’re <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/"><span class="s2">combining apartments</span></a>), it’s often helpful to add the idea of one. This can be done by putting up pressurized walls to carve out an office nook, or by adding <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/putting-walls-multifunctional-spaces-privacy/"><span class="s2">sliding doors </span></a>across a large living room to create a den space. While this type of renovation won’t change the legal designation of the number of bedrooms in your unit, it helps buyers envision more uses for the space.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">The best exterior home upgrades for resale value</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">An upscale garage door replacement that costs $3,695 has a resale value of $3,491 and recoups <b>94%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Replacing vinyl siding with mid-range manufactured stone veneer costs on average $9,357 has a resale value of $8,943 and recoups <b>95%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range wooden deck addition that costs $14,360 has a resale value of $10,355 and recoups <b>72%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-range fiber-cement siding replacement that costs $17,008 has a resale value of $13,195 and recoups <b>77%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Replacing a mid-range steel entry door for a cost of $1,881 has a resale value of $1,294 and recoups <b>68%</b></span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Curb appeal project ideas</h4>
<p>Curb appeal catches the eye of prospective buyers. Consider these exterior ideas to boost a home&#8217;s resale value:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Repair the driveway<b> $1,000-$5,000</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Spruce up the house number <b>$10-$100</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Invest in landscaping <b>$200-$2,000</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Repaint the exterior<b> $5,000-$15,000</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Remember: </b>In highly localized markets, like metropolitan cities, it’s important to make decisions in consultation with your real estate agent. What works in one neighborhood might not work in another. They will be the best person to guide you on where it makes sense to invest in a renovation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Keep in mind you don’t need to spend a lot of money to upgrade your home. Weigh the financial and time costs, and consider whether you’d take a lower purchase price to save yourself the trouble. And remember, it’s not about recouping the exact value of the renovation in the sale price, but getting buyers to make offers in the first place!</span></p>
