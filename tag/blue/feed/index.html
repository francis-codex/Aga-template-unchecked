										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>These Sweeten renovators opted to add color to their kitchens, with head-turning results </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31966 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT06.jpg" alt="blue backsplash" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />The use of color is perhaps the single most important ingredient when re-designing a space. It can add a point of interest that elevates the design and makes it stand out. But a “pop of color” doesn’t mean the color has to be overly bold. It can be a nicely balanced rich hue that helps define the look of the space. Here, we share examples of Sweeten renovators who added color to kitchens and turned up the overall design of their homes.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Blue kitchens for the win</h3>

<p style="text-align: left;">The use of the color blue has seen an uptick in use in the last few years. As seen in these Sweeten renovations, the shade, placement, and amount of blue may vary, but each project uses the hue to its fullest potential. <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Walter&#8217;s renovation</a> of their Park Slope apartment included a kitchen and bath remodel but it&#8217;s the kitchen where they made the most dramatic choice. They used Lucerne from Benjamin Moore to give style to their entire kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Conversely, Sweeten renovator <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/chef-remodels-belltell-loft-kitchen-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnish</a> wanted his kitchen to be <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more neutral for resale purposes</a> but still wanted to add some personality. He did so by putting in white upper and base cabinets but using blue (almost black) cabinets in the peninsula.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These Sweeten homeowners wanted a &#8220;classic [kitchen] with flair.&#8221; To achieve this, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-stamp-of-approval-for-a-westchester-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracey and Brian</a> incorporated blue when redoing their kitchen—a project that they had dreamed about since they moved into their Pelham Manor home 14 years ago. Blue is Tracey&#8217;s favorite color, so like Laura and Walter, they found a color from Benjamin Moore they liked. However, they were pleasantly surprised when they realized Omega had cabinets in almost that exact shade, eliminating the need for a custom paint color.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A long-distance relationship would soon culminate into living together in a 1915 co-op for <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-studio-co-op-renovated-for-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim and Ian</a>. With Kim in New Jersey and Ian in Australia, they were relieved that shopping for materials could be done online, including the sky blue herringbone backsplash tile.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Going green in the kitchen</h3>

<img decoding="async" width="600" height="900" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Laura-Kitchen-3-600x900.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large" alt="sea green kitchen cabinets with white countertop and sink with steel faucet after renovation" type="single-slider" link="none" columns="1" size="large" ids="44338,45656" orderby="post__in" include="44338,45656" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Laura-Kitchen-3-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Laura-Kitchen-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Laura-Kitchen-3.jpg 1705w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />
<img decoding="async" width="600" height="900" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-10-600x900.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large" alt="emerald green cabinets" type="single-slider" link="none" columns="1" size="large" ids="44338,45656" orderby="post__in" include="44338,45656" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />

<p style="text-align: left;">These Sweeten renovators <a href="https://www.bhg.com/kitchen/cabinets/styles/green-cabinet-colors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decided to give green a go</a>. When Keren Richter&#8217;s client hired her to design the <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-williamsburg-studio-goes-boutique-hotel-chic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a> in his Brooklyn home, she was happy he was game to think of the box. &#8220;Repainting the gray kitchen cabinetry in a vivid green was a biggie,&#8221; recalled Keren. “The color is a total showstopper, and we are so glad he was game!” Likewise but in a softer hue, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-patio-house-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Tim</a> updated their Queens townhouse kitchen in green. The mint green shaker-front cabinets &#8220;match the feel of the old house but are also clean and modern at the same time.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For their kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gina and Andrew</a> were inspired by their co-op&#8217;s verdant backyard. They wanted to bring the outside in, so they chose a beautiful shade of agave for the lower cabinets. Similarly, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maggie and Adam</a> chose a light green  for their lower cabinets in order to &#8220;add the layer of color that fit their style.”</p>

<h3>A passion for a purple kitchen</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-peninsula-custom-cabinets" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33020" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="white kitchen peninsula with custom cabinets in open purple and white kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-kitchen-fit-for-the-lights-on-broadway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marissa</a> used Sweeten when remodeling her bathroom a few years ago. So, when she and her husband, Jeremy, were ready to redo their kitchen, they turned to the renovation matchmaker once again. Their Sweeten contractor was able to help them envision the flow and look of the space. To keep the space from feeling washed out with all white cabinets, they added a deep purple on the nearby walls. The result is a stylish yet classic design that will stand the test of time.</p>

<h3>Not-so-mellow yellow cook space</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-quartz- countertop-black cabinets" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33847 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="white quartz countertop over black kitchen cabinet and orange moroccan tiles backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/moroccan-tile-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David and Dawn&#8217;s kitchen</a> in their Park Slope loft was badly in need of a renovation. The cabinets had seen a lot of wear and tear, and appliances and drawers were not in the best positions. They wanted a kitchen that they could entertain in. They worked with a Sweeten contractor to reconfigure the layout and then turned their sights on the design details. The centerpiece of the entire kitchen is the yellow Moroccan tile backsplash. “It makes us happy every day,” she said. Another delight: the organic feeling of the small details that blend seamlessly into the rest of their home.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kitchen expansion</a> in a studio apartment in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Giovanni, a Brooklyn-based doctor was looking to trade in his modern high-rise lifestyle for something with more history. This new studio, in a historic townhouse, offered original wood floors and the promise of exposing structural bricks beneath the plaster. The very basic and uninspired kitchen, however, was a distinct liability. Shoved into a shallow alcove, it had entry-level appliances and only a few inexpensive cabinets.<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Giovanni’s co-op approved his renovation proposal to combine a small closet and the alcove into an open plan for both cooking and laundry, so he turned to Sweeten for his project. His <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> helped shape the vision, and was “very good at telling me what was feasible.” Giovanni says. Breaking the plaster surface off structural brick walls proved an inexpensive way to add texture to the plain-vanilla apartment. Enlarging the kitchen footprint slightly, he added an eat-in peninsula to hide the washer-dryer while keeping pipes in roughly the same position. The backsplash is clad with matte gray subway tiles. To keep costs down, black-painted butcher block countertops offer a warmer temperature than stone. Overhead, a dropped ceiling provided space for new electrical wiring, for the high-tech pendants over the breakfast bar and for recessed lighting.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Glossy white cabinets look lush, and using stainless trim above lifts the dropped ceiling by helping it appear to float.</p>
