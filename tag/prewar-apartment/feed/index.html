<h3>Changing the entire floor plan</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our apartment, which was built in 1912, had almost all of the original details still intact. It was important for us to keep this character while adding a more usable kitchen and bathroom. The first objective was to get rid of the long hallway, which was tying up roughly 10% of the apartment. An added bonus: opening up the floor plan would bring more light in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34515 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait.jpg" alt="Park Slope homeowners Laura and Walter" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<h3>A new angle for the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, we wanted to expand the footprint of the kitchen. ­The existing layout was <em>not</em> working: it was impossible to open the oven door without running into the sink. It was also difficult for more than one person to be in the space at a time. Everyone wound up standing in the doorway to the kitchen. We posted our Park Slope apartment gut renovation on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and got to work with our contractor.</p>

<blockquote><p>Above the foyer, we dropped the ceiling by 18” for built-in cabinets. The result is nearly 30 square feet of additional storage space.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, the original kitchen and center bedroom were swapped. The apartment layout included a small angled section of wall in the center bedroom—now our kitchen. Enter our Sweeten contractor, who had this idea when he came to our apartment for the initial meeting. It was one of the primary reasons we decided to work with him. His instinct was to embrace this angle and open up the new kitchen more than the traditional 90-degree corner would allow. We lost a bit of floor space in our bedroom as a result, but the tradeoff was worth it.</p>
<p>We were able to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">include both a peninsula</a> and a dining nook in the new spacious layout. A bookshelf fits at the end of the peninsula closest to the living room.</p>

<h3>Custom built-in cabinets are key</h3>
<p>Given that we wanted to squeeze five rooms and a bathroom out of our apartment, it was important that every room was laid out as efficiently as possible. The various <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built­-ins we added</a> allowed us to accomplish just that.</p>
<p>The built-in cabinets around the dining nook and drawers under the seating bench hide a ton of additional storage. Coming from our narrow galley kitchen, we were really excited to have a space big enough for us and our friends to hang out and cook in.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-27.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34497 mb-0 size-full" title="white-and-blue-kitchen-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-27.gif" alt="white and blue kitchen cabinets with breakfast nook and built in bench after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Above the foyer, we dropped the ceiling by 18” for built-in cabinets. The result is nearly 30 square feet of additional storage space. Lowering the ceiling had the added benefit of the apartment drawing you in. It made the rest of the apartment feel spacious by comparison—a design trick inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><span style="color: #333333;">The den&#8217;s millwork could fit a full-size bed for the future.</span> </span>In our bedroom, the closets around the bed double as nightstands with­ the upper drawers on each side containing a hidden outlet.</p>

<h3>Choosing materials</h3>
<p>The footprint of our bathroom couldn&#8217;t be enlarged because of the location of the windows and the building plumbing. In order to maximize the space, we opted for a shorter tub to fit under the window, a wall-mounted toilet to free up floor space, and a wall-mounted faucet, which gives more counters space around the sink.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06.jpg" alt="bathroom tub" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-34511 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Our goal was to use natural materials as much as possible. The oak floors were a tribute to the original parquet floors (we tried to save them, but they were too thin for another sanding). We designed and cast our own concrete sink (in a small rented workshop in Industry City) to fit perfectly. The subway tiles in the kitchen and bathroom were handmade, as were the dining nook pendants—all adding subtle character and texture to the spaces. We opted for a marbled quartz countertop and think it will last much better than the real thing.</p>
<h3>Renovation tip: Order materials early</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lot of unexpected situations arose: an old dumbwaiter shaft ran through our proposed kitchen, the floor joists needed replacing, and the gas pipe had to be re­run from the basement passing through three other apartments. In retrospect, none of these things should have been surprising in an old building. Our Sweeten contractor was with us every step of the way to modify our plans to deal with the unexpected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My best tip for future renovators is to have all the fixtures with long lead times and finishes ordered before the work begins. Nothing pushes back a project deadline like waiting for materials or having all work stop because the tiles are still on the truck.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-11.jpg" alt="glass partition" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-34504 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-11-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-02.gif" alt="glass wall partition" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-34500 size-full" /></p>
<p>In the end, we were able to keep the things we loved most about our original apartment while making significant improvements to our home for now and in the future. There are so many things we can enjoy now. The kitchen has become the center of our apartment, with friends able to hang out in the dining nook or living room while still being part of the conversation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The glass partition helps bring a ton of light into the apartment. The bathroom has gone from tight-for­-one to comfortable-­for­-two. We were very lucky to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find a partner in our Sweeten contractor</a>. After living in the completed apartment, we’ve yet to find anything we’d change.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</b></span>: Combine multiple closets for more efficient storage</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: When Melissa Young first set eyes on her new apartment, she was thrilled. It was a sunlit studio space on the corner of a beautiful prewar building with plenty of windows and charm. But she knew there was a lot to be done, given that the last renovation had occurred sometime in the ‘70s. Every surface was caked with paint a quarter-inch thick (including light switches!), and the floors were badly damaged. Melissa laid out a multi-step plan as soon as she closed. Feeling overwhelmed with the number of issues, she decided to tackle a relatively simple project first—the dearth of storage—and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19335" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached out to Sweeten to be matched with contractors</a>. There were three tiny closets off the entry hall with low doorways preventing her from maximizing the vertical space available inside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>After</b></span>: With the help of her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2536" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a>, Melissa designed the largest closet doors that would fit in the space, working with California Closets to outfit the interior to create a functional, beautiful design with a mix of hanging and open shelving space. Her Sweeten contractor knocked down the wall separating two closets but left a third intact to use as a pantry space, since it was directly across from the galley kitchen. He also wired it so that her microwave and toaster oven could sit within the pantry. And although the project was intended to just focus on the closets, discussion with her contractor resulted in updates to the flooring, doors, walls, and radiators as well. In the end, Melissa’s studio had beautiful new herringbone wood floors in the hallway, refinished parquet in the main room, new baseboards, and molding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: In the process of scraping the front door, the contractor discovered that underneath a hundred years’ worth of paint was “this gorgeous metal with amazing character.” They scraped all the door frames throughout the apartment as well, uncovering the same beautiful metal patina.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Kasey set out to find a prewar apartment of his own and discovered original herringbone wood floors to take center stage</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26030 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As someone who works for a real estate investment company, Kasey has an innate appreciation for New York City’s grand architectural history. So it was no surprise when he purchased a prewar apartment along Park Avenue within the Murray Hill Historic District, which boasts landmarks such as JP Morgan’s mansion and the Union League Club. “When I moved to New York, I was fascinated by the prewar architecture,” he said. “It makes New York real estate what it is.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26029 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26031 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_foyer-e1502742377528.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26296 mb-0 size-chrono" title="foyer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_foyer-723x461.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During his search, he specifically set his sights on a prewar building with original oak herringbone floors. Even though the space he was considering appeared to be stripped of any ornate details, Kasey had seen other apartments in the building with the original patterned wood floors. He suspected—and hoped—that underneath the carpeting of what could potentially be his home, he might find the same wooden floors that he could <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinish</a> to their original condition. On his final inspection before closing, he lifted up a corner piece of the sad floor covering, and sure enough, herringbone wood floors in near perfect condition peered back. It remains one of his favorite aspects of the prewar apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That discovery was the beginning of a rather long process. Initially, Kasey planned to renovate in stages, starting with a kitchen makeover along with unveiling, sanding, and refinishing the floors. It quickly became clear that doing the whole apartment, including expanding a dressing closet into a small bedroom and renovating the bathroom, would best be accomplished all at once. The building’s co-op board, known for being strict, took six months to approve Kasey’s purchase. He anticipated that gaining their approval for the renovation would also take months and he only wanted to go through that process once. When he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5048" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project on Sweeten</a>, his matchmaker helped find a contractor who had experience navigating co-op boards. From those he interviewed (including non-Sweeten contractors), he ultimately chose a Sweeten team because of their knowledge working with tough boards and their track record renovating similar prewar apartments. “They came with the experience of what is allowed in a prewar building and what isn’t,” he said. Other historic building details included cement walls throughout the home, which made demolition an involved process but ended up benefiting as sound insulation from neighboring units.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As the board waded through his renovation plans—it ended up taking four months to approve, the same amount of time as the entire renovation—Kasey rarely <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stayed</a> in the apartment. “It was in such bad shape,” he said. He opted for hotels and couches of generous friends. The studio was an estate sale and it looked like it. A boxy kitchen, cheap and tired cabinets, a grimy bathroom and carpeted floors throughout made for a dreary atmosphere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kasey’s aesthetic goal with the renovation was “to be mindful of the prewar nature and reflect the traditional design of the building and block.” For the clunky kitchen with a cramped layout, he basically started fresh. “I wanted to open it up and make it seem as large as possible,” he said. He got rid of the wall that separated kitchen and living room; not only did this merge the two spaces, it allowed the small window in the kitchen space to spill light into the living room. That is also why he envisioned a mostly-white kitchen—to reflect more light into the living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26040 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26037 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though Kasey doesn’t cook much, he specifically wanted a Bertazzoni range after noticing its distinct and refined design during a trip to Italy and felt it fit well with the understated classic style of his kitchen. The range threatened to delay the project when the wrong model was delivered, but Kasey&#8217;s Sweeten contractors quickly replaced it with the correct model. He also wanted a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen island</a> that ended up morphing into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peninsula</a>. “It actually comes into the living room and overlaps with the wood floor to combine the two spaces,” he explained.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26051 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-During-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26050 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26052 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26057 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="1085" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-26724" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/L2A2378-as-Smart-Object-1-723x482.jpg" alt="_L2A2378 as Smart Object-1" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, he let his Sweeten contractor, a design/build firm, guide his design choice that would best suit a building from the 1940s like his. After sifting through 100-plus subway tiles that differed in color, gloss, and size, Kasey felt a white gloss subway tile was the classic way to go. Delicate hexagonal marble tiles on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor</a> and a light marble on the sink provide an understated detail. “There are no windows, so I was trying to use light shades of paint and reflective tiles to brighten it up as much as possible,” he said. Kasey’s Sweeten contractor encouraged him to keep the bathroom layout the same to avoid unnecessary permits from the Department of Buildings. He contemplated a walk-in glass shower but eventually went with a tub for resale purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were practical things to consider, such as storage lost when the dressing room turned into a small bedroom. While a door leading into a private elevator entrance was no longer in use, it helped provide space for a closet. It also remained a nice historical detail in the prewar apartment. Kasey also used furniture as a repository for more items—a living room coffee table doubles as storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While Kasey loves his new renovation—the classic look, the bright space, and those herringbone wood floors—he has a new appreciation for the involved process of renovating in Manhattan. However, he learned one important lesson. “It is much more rewarding to live in an apartment that you spent a bunch of time renovating,” he said. “It feels a lot more like it’s yours.”</p>
