										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Save on precious space and cleaning time with a wall mount bathroom faucet</h2>
<p>Bathroom renovations require many pivotal choices. One, in particular, can make all the difference. That&#8217;s right, we&#8217;re talking about the faucet. Specifically, one of our favorite options: the wall mount bathroom faucet. The seamless design not only frees up countertop space, but it also saves you cleaning time. Ahead, we round up six Sweeten homeowners’ bathrooms featuring the modern wall mount bathroom faucet fixture.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22968 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="This wall-mounted faucet gives this vintage side-table turned vanity a modern upgrade" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>1. International Inspiration</h3>
<p>A leak in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/an-architect-drafts-a-travel-inspired-bath/">Erin and Brian’s</a> bathroom made a remodel necessary. Luckily, Brian, an architect himself, had long considered a design overhaul for the space. He wanted to create a bathroom inspired by hotels he’d seen around the world. The clawfoot tub, blue tile floor, and wall-mounted faucet definitely bring in a sense of international grandeur.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26513 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-01.jpg" alt="This sleek wall mount bathroom faucet leaves the limited counter space free for storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>2. Saving Space</h3>
<p>After a successful <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation</a> with Sweeten, <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/modern-hex-tile-bathroom/">Amy and Nick</a> wanted to update their bathroom. The couple made some big, high-impact changes, like removing a wall and raising the ceiling. However, the small details really defined their space. They repurposed a side table to make a contemporary vanity. Above it, a sleek wall-mounted faucet left the limited counter space free for storage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-basin-sink-black-wall"  class="alignnone wp-image-33911 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-07.jpg" alt="white basin sink in bathroom with black wall and towel hanger behind brown door after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>3. Contemporary Touches</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-pallavi-keyurs-murray-hill-bathroom-sweetened/">Pallavi and Keyur </a>wanted a classic black-and-white palette for their bathroom remodel. They incorporated contemporary touches like a custom vanity and wall-mounted fixtures.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23590 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="This floating faucet gives the space a clean, modern, and simplistic look" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>4. Floating Fixtures</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/bathroom-remodel-injects-personality/">Meredith and Jason</a> wanted to make their small bathroom feel as big as possible. A smaller floating vanity and wall-mounted faucet made all the difference. Additionally, the wall-hung toilet (with the tank hidden behind the wall) created the illusion of more space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25776 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31.jpg" alt="This golden wall mount bathroom faucet compliments other gold fixtures in the space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>5. A Golden Touch</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-renovation-part-3/">Nazli and Larry’s</a> bathroom renovation plan was built off the wall-mounted faucet. The matching touches of gold tie the whole look together. The golden vanity hardware, wall lighting, and mirrors give the space a cohesive vibe.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36794 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom16-723x1085.jpg" alt="This golden wall-mounted faucet clears up valuable counter space for homeowners" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom16-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom16-723x1085-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom16-723x1085-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<h3>6. Small and Functional</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-work-triangle-sets-off-a-brooklyn-renovation/">These homeowners&#8217;</a> bathroom was small, yet functional. Still, they wanted to give it more style and make the space more suited to their needs. To start, they updated all the fixtures and swapped out the bathtub for a walk-in shower. The gold hardware, including the wall mount bathroom faucet, became their favorite design choice.</p>
<p>—</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.leedbuilding.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4683793738_fd591a00f5.jpg" alt="LEED FOR HOMES LOGO" /></a></p>
<p>I am not a tree-hugger. I like the idea of nature, but I like it best when witnessed from the confines of <a href="https://www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a lovely glass box</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless I&#8217;m studying for the <a href="https://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEED</a> accreditation exam, which demonstrates leadership in the design and construction of buildings that promote energy-efficiency and resource conservation. The exam covers a lot of dry technical information, and I&#8217;m undertaking it mostly because the credential has become de rigeur for architects. But all this studying has gotten me thinking more seriously about the facts underlying the formulae. I&#8217;m becoming increasingly ecologically-sensitive about the way I live and the products I use.</p>
<p>So more than six months after I completed my kitchen and bathroom remodel I&#8217;m feeling a load of green remorse, disappointment that I wasn&#8217;t more environmentally responsible when selecting products and finishes. So many building products claim that they&#8217;re &#8220;green&#8221; now that it&#8217;s easy to dismiss as a trendy marketing tactic. But each shift in product manufacturing and purchasing, however small, contributes to a much larger shift in consumption that can help us protect our resources.</p>
<p>Here are some things I&#8217;ll do differently the next time I remodel:</p>
<p><b>1. Water-conserving fixtures</b></p>
<p>I although I wasn&#8217;t aware of it at the time, my showerhead and bathroom faucet are designed to minimize water flow. The reduced flow doesn&#8217;t really affect the way the use them, because they have aerators that bolster the reduced flow with additional pressure. My old toilet, which I reused, has a 3-gallon tank. (Think of what a gallon of milk looks like. Isn&#8217;t that a lot of water?) Next time I&#8217;ll install a new toilet with a 1.6 gallon tank or with a dual-flush system that uses a full flush was only when needed.</p>
<p><b>2. Energy-saving appliances</b></p>
<p>The refrigerator, dishwasher and microwave I chose all have Energy Star ratings, which means that they meet or exceed that organization&#8217;s standards. Next time I&#8217;m shopping for appliances I&#8217;d like to compare ratings more closely and try to maximize savings.</p>
<p><b>3. Cabinetry without urea formaldehyde</b></p>
<p>Lots of the plywood and fiberboards used in cabinetry are built with glues that contain urea formaldehyde, a damaging VOC (volatile organic compound) that leaks into the air and into our lungs. When looking for kitchen cabinets next time, I&#8217;ll to find out whether they contain this compound and, if so, what the alternates are.</p>
<p><b>4. Salvaged pieces</b></p>
<p>I bought all of my products brand new. My kitchen is so small that I might have been able to find good wood cabinetry, a good sink, and stone countertops at a consignment shop. Using reclaimed products saves resources and diverts waste from landfills. <a href="https://www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Habitat for Humanity ReStore</a>, <a href="https://reclaimedhome.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reclaimed Home</a>, and <a href="https://unitedhousewrecking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United Home Wrecking</a> are all good places to hunt for spectacular finds.</p>
<p><b>5. Tiles manufactured locally or with recycled content</b></p>
<p>I chose tiles for the kitchen and bathroom without regard for where or how they were made. Next time I&#8217;ll try to source tiles that are manufactured locally, or that have some recycled content. Buying locally helps to prevent emissions from shipping. And many manufacturers that sell at large retailers, like <a href="https://americanolean.com/leed.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Olean</a>, are beginning to incorporate recycled materials into new product lines.</p>
<p><b>6. Low-VOC paint</b></p>
<p>Interior acrylic house paint contains VOC&#8217;s in acceptable, regulated quantities. But several popular companies are manufacturing lines of paint with specially reduced VOC content, like Benjamin Moore EcoSpec.</p>
<p><b>7. Efficient light fixtures</b></p>
<p>A big chunk of the electricity used in our country, about 20%, goes to interior lighting. When selecting undercabinet and ceiling light fixtures I was more concerned with the light quality than with the light source. But different bulbs use very different amounts of electricity. A simple way to save power and money is to choose lights with efficient halogens or LED bulbs, or to use fluorescent bulbs in incandescent fixtures.</p>
