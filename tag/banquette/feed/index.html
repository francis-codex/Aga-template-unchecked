			<h2 class="p1">From kitchens and outdoor spaces to flex rooms, Chicago home design trends point to customization, utility, and eye-grabbing accents</h2>

<p>Like homeowners nationally, those in Chicago are looking to remodel their homes to do more and with style.</p>
<p>When tackling remodeling projects, they’re going beyond what’s new. They’re considering exactly what they want, prioritizing to meet the budget. The overriding themes: comfort, convenience, cleanliness, and wellness.</p>
<p>With the help of interior designers, <a href="http://www.unpatterned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carly Moeller of Unpatterned</a>, and <a href="https://inspiredinteriors.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emily Mackie of Inspired Interior</a>, both based in Chicago, we explore Chicago home design trends to watch.</p>
<h3>What Chicagoans want in a home renovation</h3>
<p class="p2">Spaces topping remodeling lists in Chicago haven’t changed much—kitchen, bath, and outdoor. But the ingredients and wish lists have. In addition, there is a new desire for multitasking areas. Some actually point to a move away from open-concept plans to spaces with more definition. Still, the open kitchen/family room is a winning combination.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="white-living-gray-wall-panelling" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50585 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors.jpg" alt="white living room with gray wall panelling and long windows after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above) Design project by Emily Mackie in Chicago. Photos by Michael Alan Kaskel</em></span>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whole house renovations</a>—gutting as well as <a href="https://chicago.curbed.com/2020/2/28/21152809/adu-chicago-legalization-coach-house-granny-flat-affordable-housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding on or building up</a>—are still on track. Perhaps even more popular is reconfiguring an existing footprint. It’s a creative challenge that’s also <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2020-home-renovation-costs-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost-effective</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Chicago homeowners are less inclined to go to cookie-cutter plans. Instead, they’re opting for customization, making remodeled spaces their own. Making sustainable materials choices also is more intentional.</p>
<p class="p2">“Remodeling is a little less restrictive,” said designer Carly Moeller. “It’s not about ‘Is this OK for resale?” It’s about how I want it. Am I happy when I walk in? Making it your own.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">Kitchens increase function and style</h3>
<h4>Cabinetry and appliances</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Kitchen cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frameless styles convey clean lines</a>, with modern hardware or without. Move away from the extra carvings and moldings. Look for a shift from neutral—especially all white. Most liked: hues from soothing, livable shades like blue-green, blues, and greens.</li>
<li class="p2">Islands are changing shape and size.  &#8220;Stepping down&#8221; creates multiple levels of countertop for different functions. Longer, narrower islands also are a different look. Some cantilever over a perpendicular “table.” Others house storage on one end, while open space to pull up chairs is on the other.</li>
<li class="p2">Induction cooktops are gaining fans. The method cooks food more quickly and is more energy-efficient. Plus French chefs have given them a seal of approval.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p2">Countertops and fixtures</h4>
<ul>
<li>Quartz is the new stone. Porcelain slabs also offer an alternative. Color, pattern, with dramatic veining spice up a range of looks beyond white marble. Both boast antibacterial properties and are easier to clean.</li>
<li>Tile backsplashes are making a splash with texture, tone-on-tone patterns, and geometric shapes.</li>
<li class="p2">So does statement lighting. Hanging pendants in multiples, ramped-up scale, and large horizontal fixtures lend importance. Organic shapes add appeal.</li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s2">Metal finishes for faucets and hardware add sophistication and modernity. Burnished gold and matte black are popular.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Whole-home features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Smart Home tech connects smartphones with more activities in the home. Security, lighting, window shades, refrigerator thermostats, and range features (with cameras that monitor contents and cooking)</li>
<li class="p2">Ceilings are becoming a focal point. Wood beams, beadboard (painted or natural wood), and even wallpaper train our eyes upwards.</li>
<li class="p2">Wide plank wood flooring still is in vogue. However, very wide (12 inches) boards are less common than 5—7 inches.  “We’re definitely using a lot of lighter finishes,” said Emily Mackie. “Limewashed looks.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">A place for everything: Storage in the spotlight</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Pantries are top of the wish list. Organization is essential. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walk-in pantries</a> are preferred if there’s room. Otherwise, pantry “cupboards” or pullouts feature cubbies for everything from spices to canned and packaged goods. “Homeowners want to be more creative about how they use space,” said Carly.</li>
<li class="p2">Prep kitchens—High-end designers find that clients like to separate prep from presentation and entertaining. The design includes a butler&#8217;s pantry-type of space or “second kitchen” that keeps the mess out of sight.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" title="bar-area-black-cabinets" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50584 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors.jpg" alt="bar area with black cabinets and black leather chairs and long panelled glass windows after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><em><span class="img-label">(Above) Design project by Emily Mackie in Chicago. Photos by Dustin Halleck Photography.</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Breakfast bars, bars, other built-ins—Organization drives these dedicated spaces. Equipment, accessories and cups, glasses, etc. all are within easy reach. “I did an a.m./p.m. cafe,” said Emily. “We took a portion of the kitchen and made it a mini coffee bar by day and a wine bar by night.”</li>
<li class="p2">Mudrooms—Some designers predict the demise of mudrooms. Still, the need for a place to contain outerwear, footwear, and sporting equipment isn’t going away soon. “I don’t have a mudroom at my house,” said Emily. “But I have a dedicated closet space.”</li>
<li class="p2">Look for more hybrid spaces. For a couple with three children, Carly was asked to design storage space that would feel seamless, as it spilled into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modest-sized kitchen</a> and family room. Her solution: three lockers, one for each child, bench to one side with storage inside. For symmetry, there’s a table with a bench and chairs on the other side of the cabinets. She painted the wall and lockers bright blue.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">Baths focus on refreshing body and mind</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Freestanding, shapely tubs are as much of a dramatic focus as they fill a need to chill out. The spa aesthetic is a target. Air tubs take over whirlpools while soaking tubs are most popular. “I’ve been doing a lot more soaking tubs,” said Emily.</li>
<li class="p2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roomy showers</a> still favor rain effects and multiple showerheads. Even better is built-in sound.</li>
<li class="p2">Bidet toilets or toilet seats—Hygiene is a huge driver;  plus, you don’t have to worry about running out of toilet paper.</li>
<li class="p2">Slab installations are gaining ground, especially with lighter-weight materials like porcelain. The seamless, groutless look gets a huge nod of approval.</li>
<li class="p2">Some storage ideas borrow from the kitchen. Emily created a bubble bath bar with a display rack for bath oils, crystals, and salts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">Outdoor rooms are at-home getaways</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Compartmentalizing the landscape makes it flow from the indoors. Following interior cues, the goal is to create <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/renovate-an-outdoor-space-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spaces for sitting, lounging</a>, entertaining, cooking, and dining. All in a green context, with plantings of trees, shrubs, and flowers.</li>
<li class="p2">Roof decks, usually on the top of the garage are a solution for shrinking yard space. This requires adequate structure to hold furnishings, kitchens, and landscaping, with built-in irrigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" title="rooftop-deck-gray-table" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50586 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors.jpg" alt="deck on rooftop with gray table and chairs and teak tile floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;">(Above) Design project by Emily Mackie in Chicago. Photos by Dustin Halleck Photography.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Outdoor kitchens feature built-in grills, refrigerators, sinks, and specialty equipment like kegerators to dispense draft beer. In the Midwest, pizza ovens are often part of the design. Chicago at-home chefs even use them in the winter—they just shovel a path.</li>
<li class="p2">Freestanding heaters and built-in fireplaces extend the season. A range of firepit styles offers additional options.</li>
<li class="p2">Water features like ponds or small containers with waterfalls add a vacation vibe.</li>
<li class="p2">Entertainment includes outdoor-safe TVs and screens for movie-watching. “People are trying to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find ways to escape</a>,” said Emily. “When the home becomes the office, where do you go? Where there used to be square footage with a singular purpose, now I feel it’s a.m. and p.m.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">Chicago home office goes beyond Zoom</h3>
<p class="p2">The home office has re-emerged, whether standalone or integrated into the kitchen or family rooms. Flex work styles are more plentiful. So homeowners are thinking again about WFH spaces—even dedicated ones. Converting extra bedrooms or a spot in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/basement/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement</a> offer options besides integrating into kitchen/family rooms.</p>
<p class="p2">“Basement offices have become hodgepodge rooms,” said Carly. “One client needed flex space for kids to work, so we did three built-in desks with shelving.”</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="gray-workstation-niche-open-shelves" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50582 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned.jpg" alt="gray workstation niche with open shelves and white desk after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">(Above) Chicago design project by Carly Moeller. Photos by Dustin Halleck Photography.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Bedroom/bath suites are sanctuaries</h3>
<p class="p2">This remains a prime candidate for opening up small rooms or moving walls. “In one, we turned the top floor into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary suite</a>,” said Carly. “There had been two smaller bedrooms and a bath.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">Making room for hobbies, games, and exercise</h3>
<p class="p2">Activities like crafts, exercising, gaming, indoor driving ranges are inspiring re-dedication of real estate, especially in basements.  There’s a need for versatility and multitasking flex spaces. <span class="s2">This is not unlike the megamansion feature a few years back: dedicated rooms for wrapping packages.</span></p>
<p class="p2">“Workout and meditation rooms also are requested. Square footage needs to be multifunctional,&#8221; said Emily. &#8220;Clients now are considering more creative solutions. &#8216;Why don’t we rip out the dining room and put in a killer lounge?&#8217;” She continued, <span class="s2">“I converted my own garage. Lounge chairs, leftover rugs, heaters—for the kids.</span>&#8220;The City Council of Chicago has removed a ban that had prohibited ADUs since 1957. Be sure to find a contractor who is <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up-to-date on local codes and regulations</a>.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Expanding space with visual tricks</h3>
<p class="p2">Adding large windows and skylights brings in natural light and visually expands space. Also, without adding square footage, raising ceiling heights makes a room live larger.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Chicago home design trends: Making a statement</h3>
<p class="p2">Chicagoans are personalizing more in home remodeling. There’s more room for a little drama. Focal points include sculptural bathtubs, kitchen islands punctuated with bold veining, or floor-to-ceiling featured fireplaces. Solving clutter in clean, functional spaces that are comfortable and make you feel good is the goal.</p>

<h3>Finding a dream-like duplex in the Upper East Side</h3>
<p>It takes just a word to sum up this family’s home-finding experience: miraculous. In the cosmopolitan stretches of Manhattan’s Upper East Side, where even the parks are tiny and concrete-dipped, Jenn and Jon, six-year-old Elliott, two-year-old Abigail, and their Cockapoo, Zucca, found a place that can only have dropped out of a dream. The 2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom duplex in Yorkville, a tony area near the East River’s edge, was in a 1910 building a stone’s throw from Gracie Mansion, the New York City mayor’s residence.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43295 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43298" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1.jpg" alt="Duplex floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The story was that decades back, a former owner of the five-floor, then ten-unit building had combined three one-bedroom apartments to create a huge two-level residence with sole access to a sprawling rear garden. “W<span class="s1">e fell in love with the unbelievable backyard garden</span>,” said Jenn, the executive director of a family foundation, not to mention the amazing location. The problem was—and every Manhattan miracle has one—that the duplex needed renovation work.</p>
<p>From what Jenn and her partner, Jon, a lawyer at a bank, could see, little had been touched since the 1970s. The floors throughout were in poor condition. The white laminate kitchen was 40 years old and had an unfriendly layout. It was a daunting prospect for a couple with no construction experience, but before long, they were in contract. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/33394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their duplex renovation</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors, hired <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their design-build firm</a>, and jumped in.</p>

<h3>Plotting the &#8220;must-haves&#8221; for the duplex renovation</h3>
<p>Jenn and Jon planned on four months for the duplex renovation. &#8216;Apartment is in good shape and does not need to be gutted,&#8217; they’d stated in their Sweeten post. “We knew we needed a full reno on the galley kitchen,” Jenn said, “but most everything else just needed a serious refresh.” Light updates were given to the 2.5 bathrooms including the master, the kids&#8217; bath, and a half bath.</p>
<blockquote><p>We fulfilled it with everything from the new U-shaped eat-in banquette to the pantry, where huge pull-out drawers let the kids access their own snacks.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the “Must Do” list finalized, Jenn and Jon got to work with their Sweeten contractor’s design team. “We wanted a transitional-modern space that was light and airy,” Jenn said. “Our look, playing off of the brand-new white oak floors we were putting in and the existing black hardware like the stair rail and window frames, was ‘black, white, and wood.’” For inspiration, they followed the Instagram #BlackWhiteWood hashtag, which delivered great ideas.</p>

<p>Beginning in the kitchen, they got to work on what bothered them most: not old cabinetry, but two light-blocking openings that made the galley room feel closed off. The first was a partial wall between the eating area and the kitchen. The second, on the opposite end, was a too-small pocket door inhibiting flow to the living room. “The ground floor has only two natural light sources—the front kitchen window, which overlooks the street, and the garden door to the back—so this opening up was essential,” Jenn said.</p>
<p>By knocking out the divisive walls, they maximized light and flow, making the kitchen a focal point of their home and family life. “Having a well-laid-out space where we can cook and eat together as a family was one of our priorities,” Jenn said, “and we fulfilled it with everything from the new U-shaped eat-in banquette to the pantry, where huge pull-out drawers let the kids access their own snacks.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43297 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a.jpg" alt="living room leading to outdoors" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) First-floor family room</em></span></p>
<p>In the kitchen and the apartment’s other rooms, Jenn and Jon selected materials in classic styles, like Shaker cabinets and five-panel doors, but finished with a modern flair. “We said no to crown molding,” Jenn said, “and kept the four-inch floorboards natural by sealing them with a white-infused stain.” As planned, they riffed off the existing black hardware, but mixed in metals, including brass light fixtures and stainless kitchen appliances, to relax the overall effect. They were stymied by the choices—working across so many rooms, they seemed endless. “It was hard making so many ‘permanent’ decisions over a short time,” Jenn said.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">They soon realized they would have to install new white oak floors throughout, since the existing ones were stained, warped, or patched with cheap flooring that had been laid down years ago. (“They were mismatched, different heights, just an overall disaster,” Jenn said.) </span><span style="color: #333333;">The stairs and risers, however, were sanded and stained to match the new floors. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/creative-radiator-covers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radiators worked</a>, but needed covers; the through-wall air conditioners screamed for an upgrade. The <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closets would get built-ins</a>, and the family needed more shelves, nooks, and stowaways up and down. New doors and molding would be necessary. Oh, and of course they would paint—everywhere.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43228" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-18.jpg" alt="master bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">A large bedroom on the second floor—that was once two separate rooms— would be divided again into two kids’ rooms complete with new closets in each. Their bathrooms, formerly a Jack-and-Jill with two entrances, had a wall built in turning them into two separate spaces once again. </span></p>
<p>“Jon was the one with the vision,” Jenn said. “We bought the apartment knowing it would need work to feel like our ‘forever home,’ but I was concerned going in about how much effort it would require.” They’d preferred a turnkey place but realized, having looked long and hard, that finding a comparable, renovated apartment they could afford, especially in such a prime location, would be near-impossible. And so, with a commitment to work together—because they’d heard too many stories of renovations tearing couples apart—they agreed to make it happen, in the name of a big, beautiful city home.</p>
<h3>Getting a hang of the renovation learning curve</h3>
<p>As first-time renovators, Jenn and Jon not only felt overwhelmed by the day-to-day, but knew little about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budgets, timeframes, or permits</a>. “We went in blind and had to learn fast!” Jenn said. <span class="s1">Because of this, and due to large last-minute changes to the plan—including an unforeseen full-frame exterior backdoor to the garden and brand new solid hardwood floors throughout—they exceeded their budget by about 30%.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43217 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07.jpg" alt="Guest bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) Half bathroom</em></span></span></p>
<p>Still, Jenn said, it was worth it. “Our new home has significantly impacted our quality of life. The garden, where the kids can run free, is the biggest contributor to that, but a fabulous eat-in kitchen and two floors for stretching out are big assets, too,” she said. “To us, the place lives more like a house than an apartment—we are truly in love.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Thanks to kitchen banquette seating, casual dinners just got cozier</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mealtime is about more than just eating a meal: it’s about sharing one. How to fit all of your loved ones around the table to break bread? Look no further than banquette seating. These cozy benches are ideal for promoting intimacy and maximizing floor space. See how these homeowners worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, to bring kitchen banquette seating to their homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29713 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01.jpg" alt="The addition of banquette seating gave this family new, flexible eating options" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">1. Additional Dining Options</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/1920s-westchester-home-gets-a-modern-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooke and Paul’s</a> kitchen didn’t fit the family of five’s active lifestyle. They needed a more functional space for their three kids. That&#8217;s why they created multiple kitchen dining areas. From an eat-in island to a kitchen banquette, the new additions gave the family more flexible seating options. The custom L-shaped bench provides a casual, comfortable family dining space.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" title="gray-patterned-walls-large-dining-tables"  class="alignnone wp-image-44345 mb-48 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-22.jpg" alt="gray patterned walls for large dining tables and chairs with orange benches after renovation" width="1000" height="692" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-22-600x415.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-22-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />2. Flexible Family Time</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/duplex-remodel-first-time-renovators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenn and Jon’s</a> top priority was transforming their galley kitchen into “…a well-laid-out space where we can cook and eat together as a family.&#8221; To start, they knocked down dividing walls and a small pocket door. Next, they installed U-shaped eat-in kitchen banquette seating. Finally, this family had a space where they could gather for both meals and quality time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-25.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34493 size-full" title="banquette" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-25.jpg" alt="This banquette seating gives homeowners more seating and additional storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-25.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-25-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-25-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-25-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3. Room to Entertain</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prewar details gave <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Walter’s </a>home lots of charm. However, the original kitchen layout was a challenge. With their Sweeten contractor, the couple completely reimagined the space. Together, they created a kitchen with room to cook and entertain. The dining nook now provides additional seating and plenty of storage.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">4. Seating and Storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nazli and Larry’s</a> townhouse renovation was a big undertaking. They decided to turn the parlor into a dining room and bar area. They also added a long, built-in bench beneath the large Tiffany window. This new addition supplies plenty of seating and offers hidden storage. Most importantly, it&#8217;s where the couple currently houses their son’s drawing supplies.</p>
