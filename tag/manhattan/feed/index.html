				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were many reasons to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overhaul our primary bathroom</a>. The shower door leaked constantly and the tile had lost its integrity too. Style-wise, the decor was entirely dated with traditional light fixtures, beige tiles, and mustard color on the walls. In the kitchen, the existing layout completely closed it in as a galley. We saw that the space had much more potential. For example, its builder-grade cabinets were falling apart and ready to be replaced. Our plan was to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start over in the bathroom</a> and focus on maximizing storage and establishing more functionality. </span></p>					</div>

It was backordered and ended up taking eight months to ship. As a result, the plumber had to return months later after the renovation was done to put in the final trim pieces. </span></p><p>Instagram inspired me to try a bold wallpaper to bring some color and interest to our windowless bathroom and neutral tile. I bought this floral pattern as a peel-and-stick since I wasn&#8217;t ready to commit to it. But after a few weeks, the wallpaper would peel away every time I took a shower. By this time, I totally loved the pattern so I invested in the traditional paste version. There&#8217;s been no problem with moisture since. </p>					</div>

They&#8217;ll be happier to know about it before it&#8217;s too late to fix it.

<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Homeowners:</strong> Geoffrey, an architect, and Alicia, who works in operations at a FinTech startup, posted their modern <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/123489#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room remodel</a> on Sweeten</li>
<li><strong>Where:</strong> Manhattan on Central Park South</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> An updated living room creates custom zones with millwork and additional walls in their one-bedroom apartment</li>
<li><strong>With:</strong> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Homeowner&#8217;s quote:</strong> &#8220;Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with homeowner Geoffrey. <span class="s1">&#8220;After&#8221; photos by Kate Glicksberg.</span></i></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">An opportunity to invest in Central Park South</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the pandemic, we saw a lot of people giving up on New York, and thought it was the perfect time to double down. We drew a box around the southern half of Central Park and started searching. A lot of units had recently been taken off the market but we reached out to realtors to see if the sellers were still interested in making a move. We found our home in an ideal building and location, and made an offer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowners and their dog" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52587" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our 1,000-square-foot apartment is in an iconic mid-century building on Central Park South, which we felt offered us the best of all worlds. The Upper East and Upper West sides were easy to get to, and we love being able to spend our weekends alternating between the two.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A love of pre-war layouts</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the past, we’d always lived in pre-war buildings with architectural character and well-defined floor plans. You don’t get a lot of that in modern buildings like the mid-century one we landed in, so we created our own. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, and hired our general contractor. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg" alt="dining room and modern living room remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52579 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Geoffrey-fireplace.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-53002 size-full" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wouldn&#8217;t be adding molding, chair rail, or opening up the kitchen, which are so popular these days. Instead, our plan was to define the layout in discrete ways that would <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create separate zones</a>—a proper entry foyer, a generous space for dining, and a desk niche.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our apartment’s original living room was 13 feet across and more than 30 feet long, so we had plenty of space to work with. Our goal was to create a more intimate and purposeful space that could be used for entertaining as well as a dedicated workspace for those work-from-home days.</span></p>
<h3>Creating niches in a modern living room remodel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like most New Yorkers, this was all about maximizing the available square footage. We had an opportunity to divide the extra-large living space for different purposes. By adding a small wall near the entrance to the apartment, we created a foyer on one side and an office area on the other. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the living room, the focal point was a 14-foot wall with custom-designed millwork crafted from European white oak and marble. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/carrara-vs-calacatta-marble-what-is-the-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single slab of Carrara marble</a> houses an electric <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-remodel-on-the-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace</a> and a recessed TV. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg" alt="modern living room remodel with niche office desk" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52584 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_07.jpg" alt="Home office with wood desk and open shelves" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52582" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">&#8220;[M]ake sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the winter, the apartment could feel a bit dreary (our courtyard views prevent us from getting a ton of natural light). Installing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/adding-fireplace-renovation-gas-wood-burning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace would turn up the cozy-dial</a>, and we designed the entire living space around that idea. We couldn’t do a real fireplace and weren’t interested in dealing with the hassle of gels or fuel logs. We chose a beautiful electric fireplace that was the most convincing artificial unit we could find.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The white oak used throughout the renovation featured strong horizontal lines echoing the building’s iconic mid-century exterior. The material also helped brighten up the space. Bump-outs of the walls near the window created a defined dining area. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Marble slab realities</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The single biggest issue during the renovation was with the large slab of Carrara marble that would clad the front of our fireplace and media wall. It was 7 feet tall and about 5 feet wide, and we insisted that it have mitered corners. We had no idea what an ordeal it would be—the mitered corners were fragile, and a slab that size was very unwieldy. Maneuvering it through the parking garage and up the freight elevator was a half-day exercise that culminated in hours of positioning, tweaking, and polishing.

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Align your budget and your expectations</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My advice to renovators? Really <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dig into the contractors</a> you’re interviewing. Make sure that you’re 100% sure that they can do the kind of work that you want, and make sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In terms of our budget, we did pretty well and came within <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1% of the projected cost</a>. It was about $35,000 including the fireplace. Overall, we couldn’t be happier. The space is doing <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything we wanted it to</a>, and we’re excited to cozy up in front of the “fire” this winter.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<h3>Remodeling an outdated 80&#8217;s West Village kitchen</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36013 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-36010 size-full" title="jonathan-standing-in-kitchen-with-wife" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01.jpg" alt="jonathan standing in his kitchen with his wife in front of white kitchen cabinets and herringbone pattern subway tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<div></div>
<p>Though Erin and Jonathan’s West Village kitchen in their 750-square-foot apartment was, for the most part, functional, it didn’t suit their style. Another downside: the kitchen did not make the best use of the available space. Open to the living area, there was plenty of room to add the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in island</a> on the couple’s wish list, plus reimagine the layout. Ready to bid farewell to the ‘80s cabinetry and shabby tile flooring, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project to Sweeten</a> and were matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a general contractor</a>.</p>
<h3>Picking renovation materials and kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36018 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="waterfall-marble-island-with-pendant-lights"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floor and waterfall marble island with pendant lights and white walls after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36013 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36018 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-36018 size-full" title="waterfall-kitchen-island-with-cabinet-drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floor and waterfall marble island with pull out drawers inside cabinets and pendant lights after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The basic kitchen transformed into a bright, modern marvel complete with new stainless steel appliances, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/sleek-waterfall-island-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall island</a>, and light fixtures. The overall contemporary culinary space also got some more classic updates, like the Shaker-style cabinets and herringbone tile backsplash. To connect the kitchen with the rest of the living area, 5-inch white oak flooring was installed throughout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A French door refrigerator replaced the older model, while the new dishwasher (that has a window and lights up!) moved to the stove&#8217;s previous location. A stainless steel hood and gas range found a new central location in the space across from the storage-packed island.</p>
<h3>Working through the renovation process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor brought the couple’s vision to life, ensuring everything was on time and on budget. “The contractor’s app was also a very helpful tool for us to make material selections and track the progress of the project,” Jonathan said. Their contractor provided valuable input, guiding them on sourcing materials, layout, and space considerations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The entire process was intimidating. From planning, scheduling, prepping, and deciding, it was all new to us. Sweeten and our contractors made us feel at ease,” he continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation had its challenges (the couple moved into a sublet for three months), but it wrapped up beautifully. “Before, there was a daily struggle for space and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>. Getting a certain level of cleanliness was never attainable in an older apartment. Now when we walk in the door, it’s a breath of fresh air,” Jonathan said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: The countertops are actually marble-like quartz that doesn’t just look pretty; it’s very durable too!</p>

<h3>Wear-and-tear of a well-used kitchen shows</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 23 years since Susan and Carl bought a one-bedroom East Village co-op, they&#8217;ve made a lot of changes. “The history is long in this space,” said Susan, including withstanding 16 years of kids and dogs. She isn’t exaggerating. This couple bought the neighboring studio apartment in 1997, bumping up their square footage to 1,400. They hired someone to do the bare minimum to connect the two apartments and did everything else themselves. A few years later, while an “inept” contractor did a poor job of fixing up the bathroom, the couple went on to do a DIY job with the kitchen. A leaky dishwasher eventually ruined the flooring.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With low interest rates, they decided to refinance their mortgage and renovate, which brings this story to the present day. Despite those DIY fixes, the kitchen wasn’t at its full potential. A dropped ceiling in certain areas eliminated what could be very useful storage space. The recessed canned lights hanging from the ceiling also made the kitchen feel small. Even with a cutout in the wall toward the living room, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/entertaining-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">layout didn&#8217;t suit entertaining</a>. “Whenever we had company,” said Susan, “everyone would squeeze into the end of the kitchen while I cooked and doled out snacks.”</p>
<h3>Finding the right expertise to get the job done</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the disaster of the bathroom contractor etched in their minds, Susan and Carl promised themselves to scrutinize the next person they worked with. They found Sweeten and posted their project, a choice that paid off many times over. For example, they discovered a beam that they feared would force them to shorten the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets and give up storage space</a>. But the Sweeten contractor they chose “knew exactly how to notch out the back of the taller cabinets to accommodate the beam,” said Susan.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple spent hours on Pinterest and decided against uniformity in the long, narrow space, opting for family- and pet-friendly materials and layout instead. “We wanted to eliminate the bowling alley feel,” she said. This was achieved by mixing cabinets and shelves, as well as glass and solid doors, and horizontal and vertical lines. Moving the window gate from the inside to outside was another simple fix that made a big difference. That change now enables them to open the bottom half of the gate. They opted for a painted backsplash rather than tile. “It leaves open the possibility of changing colors when you get tired of it,” she said.</p>
<h3>Lessons learned from this East Village renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The job went smoothly with no issues with her contractor—even though the &#8220;construction dust was hard to live with&#8221;—the couple still has tips for other renovators: 1. Triple your <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-kitchen-renovation-take-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timeline estimate</a> to get a realistic sense of how long a renovation will take, and 2. When your kitchen is out of order, there’s a lot you can do in a slow cooker and rice cooker, including pasta!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: This East Village renovation was full of pleasant surprises along the way. When their Sweeten contractor ripped out the dropped ceiling, Susan and Carl had expected to find something that would slow the project down. Instead, no wires, pipes or anything structural was found inside. “Compared to any other [renovation] jobs, nothing significant held us back with this one,” said Susan.</p>

<h3>Laying out the plan for high ceilings</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The homeowners closed on an 850-square-foot loft apartment in a multi-building complex in Greenwich Village, just a short stroll from Washington Square Park. The building dated to 1890 and had formerly housed a cast-iron factory. The apartment itself benefited from the structure’s history with high 16-foot ceilings and original detailing. The interior finishes were outdated, however, since it had been decades since the last renovation. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47451" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25.jpg" alt="loft homeowner" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They planned to convert the one-bedroom apartment into a two-bedroom while making full use of the ceiling height. A mezzanine level around much of the apartment would allow for storage and display of their art and decorative pieces. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen was tucked away in a dark corner of the loft, with dark wood cabinetry and black countertops adding to the gloom. It made more sense to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/swap-rooms-better-layout-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swap the locations of the bathroom</a> and the kitchen. This brought the kitchen closer to the the dining and living spaces. The bathroom itself needed a gut renovation. Its finish materials and all the wiring and plumbing were deteriorating.</span></p>

<h3>Out with the debris, in with the light</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As their Sweeten contractor began to demo the space, he unearthed&#8230;actual earth. The contractor found about eight inches of “some kind of dirt floor” beneath the flooring. He had to excavate it along with the rest of the demolition debris—a first for this seasoned contractor. He speculated it was perhaps due to the building’s past as a factory.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They worked to create a gallery-like space featuring bright white walls, highlighted with blackened steel accents. Keeping the finishes simple allowed the airiness of the space to shine.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47435" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="loft renovation" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47437 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16.jpg" alt="kitchen storage" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<h3>A triumph of clerestory windows</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although there are now two bedrooms rather than one, the homeowners were able to preserve a sense of expansiveness by not taking the walls all the way up to the ceiling. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/transom-windows-let-the-light-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clear glass clerestory windows</a> were installed</span><span class="s1"> in the bedrooms, as well as in the bathroom so that natural light could still shine in each part of the renovated loft. </span></p>
<h3>An integrated kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout the hallways, bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom, a steel rail was installed for a custom library ladder, to give access to the mezzanine areas. This unique system used brushed steel for the rail and brackets, and black-anodized aluminum for the portable ladder, to make it light enough to carry from room to room. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47446" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Storage-12-scaled.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the living room lost a few feet to create the second bedroom, it gained plenty of linear feet in display storage as a result of the loft renovation. Custom black steel bookcases run along the length of one wall. The contractor secured these shelves through to the studs as they were rebuilding the apartment, so they&#8217;ll be able to handle any load. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The living room space opens up to the dining nook, which also houses an upright piano. An <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/g2262/gallery-wall-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adjacent gallery wall</a>, decorated with black-framed art, provides visual interest along the interior wall. Recessed lighting and statement pendants support the minimalist aesthetic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47429" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled.jpg" alt="master bedroom" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>

<h3>Extra storage for the bathroom</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the smaller bedroom next to the kitchen, they created a lofted sleeping area for guests with a simple mattress set-up, which is also accessible via the library ladder. The elevated sleeping loft allows the floor area of the room to be used by the homeowners as a closet and dressing area. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47427" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26.jpg" alt="loft bed" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47452" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled.jpg" alt="bathroom remodel" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom received a similarly modern treatment with a deep soaking tub. A matte black towel hook and shower and sink fixtures create contrast, and match the overall black-and-white motif. Unusually, the homeowners were able to add storage above the shower area, also accessible with the portable library ladder. As with the overhead kitchen storage, the space above was built without shelves or compartments, to accommodate large or odd-shaped items. </span></p>

<h3>Learning to navigate a New York renovation</h3>
<p>A first—and obvious—lesson in renovating: it really is harder in New York. When my husband Chris and I embarked on this adventure, we thought we knew what we were doing. After all, we’d undertaken a remodel of our 1914 Seattle condo before. But that was all before we decamped to New York for work—and learned what a reno here really takes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our real estate agent brought us to a 1929 building we would have never come to on our own, smack next to the construction zone that is Hudson Yards. I was hesitant, but Chris saw a decent amount of space and a good layout in a developing neighborhood.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After moving in, we wanted to redo the kitchen, but the most urgent fix was the bathroom. An old leak from above had unmoored a section of tile, and the previous owner refused to repair it as a condition of closing. This was our first lesson in how different a Seattle and New York renovation could be.</span></p>
<h3>Deciding to do the larger renovation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our foray into a standalone bathroom remodel ended early—we got as far as finishing the design when the co-op came back with a series of unexpected plumbing requirements, chock full of things we’d never heard of like water hammer arrestors and Laticrete. The price nearly doubled, and if we were going to spend much more on a remodel, we decided we should save up and do the larger apartment renovation we had hoped to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regular re-spackling, we figured we could buy time while we saved up. That folly ended a year and a half later when, hours before leaving for vacation, a precarious section of tile came crashing down. Our super covered the crumbling wall with a plastic tarp, but it was clear: it was time to begin bidding.</span></p>

</p></blockquote>
<h3>Finding the right general contractor with multiple skills</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We weren’t sure exactly what we needed—walls weren’t moving, but our co-op required an architect. So while we asked the initial bathroom contractor to bid, we also thankfully posted our project on Sweeten. To complete our renovation, Sweeten paired us with a design-build firm with architecture training. They also did custom millwork, making it the perfect fit for our project. Not only did the general contractor immediately understand our aesthetic, but we also had a great rapport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="lead-gray-kitchen-cabinet-hardwood-floor" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48627" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-21.gif" alt="Lead gray kitchen cabinet and open refrigerator and hardwood floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In planning the remodel, we knew we wanted to play off the building’s modest Art Deco bones, but in a way that wasn’t slavish or theme-y. We also both brought mild obsessions to the mix—for me, an inexplicable passion for English cabinetry, for Chris, a desire to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">put a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/banquettes-seating-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kitchen banquette</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in every possible corner.</span></p>
<h3>Reworking the kitchen layout</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first big choice was how to manage the kitchen layout. The room was spacious enough—designed as an eat-in when 24” of counter space seemed ample—but the two doorways weren’t in an ideal location. One opened onto the foyer and the other onto a back hallway by the bedroom. It had also been poorly updated in the intervening years: half of the footprint was wasted, with a lonely refrigerator in one corner and an errant desk in another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-kitchen-cabinets-wood-floor" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48614" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08.jpg" alt="Custom gray kitchen cabinets on dark oak wood flooring and foyer with bookcase after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location of the gas riser dashed our hopes of moving the entry to adjoin the living room, so our contractor suggested closing the smaller opening to create a wide galley with room for a banquette. This would extend the cabinetry the length of the room on one side, doubling the counter space and creating room for a wine fridge and pantry to boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we played with centering the sink and range on the counter runs, our Sweeten contractor advised against it to preserve prep space. In hindsight, we were happy to have lived in the space before renovating: symmetry looked better on paper, but from experience cooking in the space, we knew her recommendation would be more functional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep the room from feeling enclosed, we substituted upper cabinets for extra-long open shelves on one side, then tucked in under-cabinet lighting for function. The banquette capped off the space, creating both more storage and a place for friends to hang out while cooking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-foyer-full-length bookcase" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48609 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03.jpg" alt="Gray foyer with full length bookcase and brown wood floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Giving the foyer a purpose </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our foyer situation was a classic New York City conundrum: too small to do much of anything useful but large enough to be wasted if empty. We decided on a full-height bookcase that’s only 8” deep and it holds loads more than we expected. On the opposite side, our general contractor fitted narrow custom cabinets to serve as a bar. There’s just enough depth to squeeze in double rows of liquor bottles and glasses, saving precious room in the kitchen. We ran new electrical to hang art lights over tall mirrors—the goal was to make the whole space pull triple duty as an entryway, a library, and a bar—then painted the foyer and kitchen cabinetry the same deep gray so that the two spaces relate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="black-ceiling-white-subway-tiles" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48619 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13.jpg" alt="Black ceiling with white subway tiles in bathroom with white tub and shower glass and white hex floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">A renewed bathroom in classic black-and-white</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n the bathroom, we preserved and refinished an original tub and stuck to a classic black-and-white New York-inspired scheme with updated finishes. Given the narrow layout, the primary play here would be with subtle geometries—and taking advantage of our building’s extra thick walls. A hex marble floor worked well with the warmer white subway tile and porcelain. Our contractor recommended extending the floor tile onto the base of the walls to stretch the visual plane of the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hexagon echoed in new shower controls that help tame the notorious temperature fluctuations that come with living in an old building. In such a small space, we took a cue from hotel bathrooms and put a pedestal sink atop console legs to keep the space open. An extra-tall recessed medicine cabinet provides both storage and electrical outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="black-white-bathroom-shower-glass" class="alignnone wp-image-48621 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-15.jpg" alt="Black and white bathroom with shower glass and wall sconces and white bathtub after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-15-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-15-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favorite thing of all is the towel warmer which took forever to source but that I deeply love for its hex bars and Anglophilic appeal. The contractor placed it in a deep niche so that the warm rails wouldn’t risk singeing passersby. We decided to paint the walls and ceiling in a black high sheen that makes the ceiling recede and the white surfaces gleam. Strangely, of all the things in the apartment, the shower glass proved one of the most frustrating: it wasn’t installed until five months after everything else wrapped up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="black-white-kitchen-wall-sconces" class="alignnone wp-image-48624 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18.jpg" alt="Black and white kitchen with wall sconces and shower glass after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Finding the budget for hardwood floors</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New wood floors were the most unexpected part of the reno. We had only budgeted for the kitchen alone. But the more floor options we looked at—and after our contractor dissuaded us from several temptations like Moroccan Bejmat tile—the more we wanted hardwood in the kitchen. That meant either putting down maple boards to match the rest of the apartment—despite disliking their color—or redoing everything. Our contractor’s opinion was that changing the kitchen floors would make one of the biggest impacts in the space. So a month into the renovation, after all the other demo was done, we raided a savings account and scrambled to add herringbone floors to the scope. The late choice delayed the project by a month, but it was one of the best decisions we made.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Becoming comfortable with flexibility </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stepping back from it now, our major lesson was in developing a deep comfort with flexibility. We found that we could be much more controlling of our remodel in Seattle than here. New York’s interminable series of permits, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-op requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and engineering reports—paired with the inelasticity of old spaces—meant we had to take a go-with-the-flow approach that made trust and an ability to laugh key. Also, best to know exactly what you’re looking for before you start to remodel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our contractor taught us the biggest lesson of all: do it all at once if you can. It’s not the disruption that’s the problem, really, or that rework ends up costing more—it’s that few of us really have the talent to create a cohesive space in small increments. Unfortunately, we didn’t quite learn this last lesson in time. During our reno, our bedroom became the storage unit for our furniture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than anything else, we were lucky to have a real partnership with our Sweeten general contractor to see us through the changes and warn us off of bad choices. We feel a bit like we’ve earned our honorary New Yorker stripes: we chose a space that we thought was a diamond in the rough and hoped we could turn it into a classic city respite. We feel like—at least to our taste—we got there, and now we have this lovely, large-living one-bedroom to come home to in one of the most dynamic parts of Manhattan.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowners Sarah and Eddy</span></em></p>
<h3>Creating unity within a floorplan</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah, a managing director at an international nonprofit, WaterAid, and her husband, Eddy, a medical consultant, thought their co-op in Washington Heights, New York, was ideal for raising their two daughters. They loved the location, near Fort Tryon Park, and the design aesthetic of their 1939 Art Deco building. The problem? An outdated kitchen that had been (seemingly) randomly renovated over the years, with one section updated at a time. It resulted in what Sarah called a “hodgepodge” layout and design. </span></p>
<div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall, it was dark and dated,” said Sarah. “The cabinets seemed to be original, but we don’t know that for a fact, but they sure looked like it.” The couple also desperately needed more counter space. “There was more space for dining than food prep,” commented Sarah.</span></p>

<h3>Finding an aesthetic to compliment the room</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, there were two windows in the kitchen. Cabinets completely blocked one window, so it wasn&#8217;t functional. By rearranging the layout, the homeowners were able to expose the window, adding more natural light to the updated kitchen</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="subway-wall-tiles-with-floating-shelves"  class="alignnone wp-image-44438 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with subway tiles on walls and marble countertop with farmhouse sink and stainless steel appliances and floating wooden shelves after renovation" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-04.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm was amazing! Both our designer, Ally, and our project manager, Petar, were like on-call doctors,” said Sarah. “They helped me with decision-making around all things—from what size appliances to buy to practical storage ideas.” Sarah and Eddy decided to keep the original floors to give a nod to the origins of the building. The kitchen received new cabinets, countertops, and appliances.</span></p>

<h3>Using the houses original walls</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they gutted the kitchen, they found beautiful brick walls hiding behind the sheetrock. The brick became a focal point behind a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/banquettes-seating-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newly added banquette</a> bringing a new texture to their streamlined, all-white kitchen. “The girls love to sit at the banquette and read while eating,” said Sarah. &#8220;And with an outlet installed in the banquette, it&#8217;s become a cozy work-from-home space during the pandemic.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, they kept the design simple and current with white cabinets and Calacatta countertops. Gray grout in the subway tile and the reclaimed wood floating shelves add contrast and personality.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="subway-wall-tiles-with-floating-shelves"  class="alignnone wp-image-44436 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-08.jpg" alt="white subway tiles on walls with floating wooden shelves and marble countertop after renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-08.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<h3>Overcoming unplanned obstacles</h3>
<p>Necessary plumbing behind the kitchen sink left Sarah and Eddy with less cabinet depth to work with. As a result, they had to install a smaller than usual sink. Fortunately, in a clever workaround, to allow the sink to maximize the counter depth, the faucet was set off to the side.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49327 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-09.jpg" alt="Image of an offset kitchen faucet" width="800" height="1200" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-09.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;We love literally everything about our new kitchen,” said Sarah. “The countertops, the pantry, the counter-depth fridge&#8230;even the vent hood!”</p>

<h3>Deciding to stay and renovate—or move</h3>
<p class="p2">Ilene and Neil have lived in this enviably located West Village condo since buying it in 2004. “We’ve always loved the building and the neighborhood,” Neil said of the 1906 structure’s history as the Henry Siegel department store. The 14th Street building was rehabbed into condominiums around 2001.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p2">There was a point where they considered moving on, Neil said. “We went through a period where we looked at other apartments,” he recalled, for more space to live in. Ultimately, though, they realized it would be hard to beat what they had. Instead of moving, they decided to renovate. Ilene, a retired CEO of a global nonprofit<span class="s3">,</span> and Neil, a retired attorney, wanted to go full-scope on the renovation and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brought in Aaron as their partner</a>.</p>

<h3>Finding an architect for the West Village condo renovation</h3>
<p class="p2">“Our challenge,” Aaron said, “was to make smarter use of the space in a way sensitive to how Ilene and Neil live day-to-day. It also needed to be flexible for when their children and grandchildren visit.” The building, having been designed and constructed as a department store, features large windows and high ceilings, making it ideal for residential use.</p>
<p class="p2">Ilene and Neil completely re-envisioned the space. On their fearless To-Do list: Relocate the apartment’s front door; shrink and move the living room and partition an “L” pass-through space into a room with the help of sliding doors; create an all-new, contemporary kitchen; to shift the dining area; install a new primary bathroom, replacing the bathtub with a walk-in steam shower; and add walk-in closets throughout the space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48971 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Library-06.jpg" alt="Image of a full wall bookshelf with library ladder and storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Library-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Library-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Library-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">“We wanted a more modern look with cleaner lines and more functionality,” Neil said. “We wanted the apartment to feel more ‘feng shui.’”</p>
<h3 class="p2">Dividing the floor plan to create more rooms</h3>
<p class="p2">After conducting vision and planning meetings with his clients, and obtaining a plan approval from New York City’s Department of Buildings, Aaron and the couple hired their Sweeten contractor. As first-time gut-renovators, Ilene and Neil’s biggest questions involved how long the project would take. They sublet a small apartment in the building so they could drop in and check on progress daily<span class="s3">.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48968 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="Image of kitchen countertops, wall of art and dining space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48969 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen peninsula and kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">They began by refinishing the original wood flooring, which runs throughout the apartment. A new room would take shape with the installation of sliding door panels to close off the base of the<span style="color: #333333;"> former “L” space, just outside the bedroom. The installation of the German-design kitchen was also a key development. “It let us envision the ultimate look and feel of the revised space for the first time,” said Neil.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #333333;">Neil was happy about the moving of the couple’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer and dryer to a small space</a> near the primary bathroom, making room for a kitchen pantry. The renovation brought added functional spaces. For Neil, the emergence of a living room that would accommodate a 65” smart TV was a</span> revelation. “Our architect and contractor both consistently came up with design and storage solutions that enhanced the project,” he said. “We were excited about everything.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48966 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Den-11.jpg" alt="Image of a living room area" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Den-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Den-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Den-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<blockquote><p>“Our architect and contractor both consistently came up with design and storage solutions that enhanced the project,” he said. “We were excited about everything.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>Navigating the renovation bumps</h3>
<p class="p2">One challenge was when the building’s architect refused to approve Aaron’s plan for the steam shower. “The building’s architect claimed—in the face of data to the contrary—that steam showers create mold,” Neil said. “Actually, being completely enclosed, they generate less discharge than regular showers.” After more discussions with the condo board and management company, the couple discovered that seven other units in the building already had steam showers. Ilene and Neil settled the issue by signing an indemnification promising payment for building problems the shower might cause.</p>

<h3>The architect turns a house into a home</h3>
<p class="p2">The duo said that one of the best moves they made was to choose an architect and general contractor who welcomed their participation, and engaged them when problems arose. <span style="color: #333333;">Aaron felt excited to work with clients who were focused not just on “the idea of a new home, but also committed to the process. They wanted to be intimately involved in and understand each design decision.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48959 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-18.jpg" alt="Image of bathroom with stone floor, steam shower and teak bench" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-18-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-18-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48962 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-21.jpg" alt="Image of a white double sink vanity" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-21.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-21-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-21-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #333333;">In addition to the condo’s owners, Aaron had other occupants to consider. “Ilene and Neil have amassed an <a href="https://stylebyemilyhenderson.com/blog/ideas-for-how-to-arrange-and-hang-wall-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amazing collection of objects</a>,” he said, “each with a specific story to tell about their lives.” Every one of their belongings, he remarked, has significant meaning. “Our goal,” he said, “was to let the architecture get out of the way and stay muted and neutral.” <span class="s3">That would let Ilene and Neil’s prized possessions make the space.</span></span></p>
<h3>A general contractor who communicates</h3>
<p class="p2">The contractor’s crew, they said, worked steadily, coordinated well with the building’s superintendent, and stayed on top of every aspect of the project as it unfolded. &#8220;<span class="s1">I’ve said it before and will say it again &#8211; our contractor will be my first call when looking for bids on the next project,&#8221; said Aaron.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The team also made cost-saving suggestions. “The Sweeten contracting team was truly professional—they were problem solvers and genuinely nice people to work with,” Aaron said. “Communication was frequent and clear, and the scheduling and billing were transparent.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48963 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bedroom-16.jpg" alt="Image of a master bedroom with art collection and ceiling fan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bedroom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bedroom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bedroom-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48965 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Closet-17.jpg" alt="Image of master closet with organization and shelving" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Closet-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Closet-17-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Closet-17-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">Their Sweeten contractor finished the project with a very manageable punch list. Ilene said, &#8220;My gratitude to our contactor and to Aaron is boundless.&#8221; The results pleased everyone. “The difference in our living space is like night and day!” Neil said. “It feels like a totally different apartment.” Months after moving back into their home, he declares, “We still love waking up here every morning.”</p>

<h3>From Renting to Buying</h3>
<p>I’ve always had a passion for real estate. I even work in real estate tech as a product manager. Since moving to the city over 10 years ago, I’ve spent my fair share of time looking at listings of apartments for sale. After many years in tiny Manhattan studios (think 300 square feet), it was time to get serious about buying an apartment.</p>

<p>I started to hunt for Manhattan apartments (with a preference for downtown) that were both affordable and true one-bedrooms. I spent around nine months going to open houses on Sundays, and after seeing many apartments, I finally stumbled upon the space I ended up buying in Chelsea.</p>
<p>It might have been how quiet and calm the apartment felt, but it was exactly what I was looking for. It is a true one-bedroom in a prewar building and has much of its original charm: a sunken living room and beautiful arches. But the original kitchen was the size of a closet. I used the fact that it was outdated as negotiating leverage and was able to bring the purchase price significantly below asking (a rarity in Manhattan).</p>

<blockquote><p>Everyone I talked to told me that the most I’d fit into the space was a 24” stove, but my heart was set on fitting a large turkey into my oven.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Deciding Who to Hire</h3>
<p>After asking around, I realized that finding a general contractor to do work in a Manhattan co-op was no easy task. I stumbled upon Sweeten, and after <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27395" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting my job</a> there, I connected with a few general contractors. I didn’t go the architect route because it would have added to my budget on top of the renovation materials. Also, I wasn&#8217;t <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planning any significant structural change</a>s. For a one-bedroom renovation, that extra cost is just enough to push the cost over the return. Without an architect, however, finding a detail-oriented general contractor who is on top of their game was paramount. That’s exactly what I found with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3275#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Sweeten contractor I chose</a>.</p>

<h3>Must-Have: An Oven to Fit a Turkey</h3>
<p>The biggest part of the remodel was gutting my tiny kitchen. I hired a kitchen designer to help me optimize the layout. She came up with configurations I couldn’t imagine possible in a 70-square-foot space. As an avid cook, I had a few (okay, maybe slightly crazy) requirements: a full size 30” stove, a large refrigerator, and a dishwasher. I was told the most I’d fit into the space was a 24” stove, but my heart was set on fitting a large turkey into my oven. And after much finagling, we found a layout that allowed for everything I wanted and more (somehow, I even fit a wine fridge).</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Kayla-Taylor-KitchenBath-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41412 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Kayla-Taylor-KitchenBath-08.jpg" alt="Image of sunken living room with railing and cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Kayla-Taylor-KitchenBath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Kayla-Taylor-KitchenBath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Kayla-Taylor-KitchenBath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>The original plan was to buy custom cabinets to maximize the tiny space, but after seeing the price tag (north of $15,000), I had to reconsider. My Sweeten contractor worked closely with me to come up with a solution: a combination of <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/kitchen-cabinets/buying-guide/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom and standard cabinets</a>. We spent two hours talking through cabinet door sizes as well as placement so that the doors were symmetrical and made sense for the space. (Trust me, this guy pays a lot of attention to detail.) For my peninsula, he took the lead on creating both a practical layout and aesthetically pleasing geometric shape. There needed to be enough room to pass when walking into the apartment (the front door is right near the kitchen).</p>

<h3>A Refresh for the Apartment</h3>
<p>Beyond the kitchen, the remainder of the renovation was giving the apartment a facelift. I refinished the floors, stripped the door frames down to their original steel, replaced the baseboards, changed the grout in the bathroom, added a closet in the bedroom, and put a nice layer of paint on all of the walls.</p>
<h3>Delivery Saga</h3>
<p>While much of the kitchen renovation was a fun process, I’d be lying if I said there weren’t bumps along the way. Most of my friends do not believe me when I tell them I bought six sinks for the kitchen. Yep, you read that right: six sinks. To make a long story short: there was a farmhouse sink that was too shallow (thankfully, my contractor pointed this out to me), one that fell off a truck during delivery, another that arrived and didn&#8217;t fit, another that arrived then got lost (and eventually found again), and two others that ended up getting returned. When the sink saga was over, my boyfriend told me he never wanted to talk about another sink again. And honestly, who could blame him?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I ended up with a beautifully renovated home that stayed true to its prewar nature. A common question I was asked after completing my renovation was: Would I do it all over again? You betcha.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Kayla and Jesse, for sharing your refreshed home!</em></p>

<h3>Remodeling for a new life chapter</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a Manhattan couple bought their three-bedroom apartment in Kips Bay Towers, designed by renowned architects I.M. Pei and S.J. Kessler, more than 30 years ago, they renovated. Fast forward three decades, which included the whirlwind of raising kids, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/renovations-dream-homes-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was time for a redo</a>. What had looked good then, now looked tired and outdated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen had already been renovated a second time and the avid entertainers, who host plenty of dinner parties, made the living and dining rooms next on the renovation list. Their interior designer, <a href="https://tarabenet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tara Benet</a>, turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found this Sweeten contractor</a> to bring the vision to life.</p>
<div></div>
<h3>Enhancing natural light in the home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The heavy linen curtains were drab and did not gracefully frame the exceptional floor-to-ceiling views from the glass-front apartment complex. The cream and beige tones also did little to complement the New York City backdrop. Comfy couches and cluttered decor lacked the glamorous, crisp, and adventurous style reflecting the couple&#8217;s modern-day taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wood flooring also became an issue. The original rug had been in the same spot for 30 years. The intense natural light left a darker footprint where the UV rays had not faded the varnish. The couple went with a lighter floor color to match the overall brighter look, adding a fresh touch to the whole renovation. Previously, the homeowners had used old-fashioned track lighting because the concrete ceiling couldn’t take any sunken lights. Their modern solution? Using two chandeliers to light the room. As a bonus, their unique design also made them a focal point in the living area.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A white-painted background became a canvas for the other elements in the room to stand out. However, the couple came to learn that white is never just white. &#8220;There was a lot of debate over the white which needed to be a little bit warmer than it was before. We ended up with a shade that has a tiny bit of orange. It has a glow to it,&#8221; Tara said. And to offset the white, a muted royal blue acts as a deep color accent and can be seen running through the custom-made rug, a throw rug, and the living room chairs. (Blue is also a contrasting color to the orange hue added to the white paint.)</p>
<h3>Picking the materials and color palette</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A secondary color palette—the metallics of brass, bronze, and gold—further balance the blue accent. This is seen in the vases on the dining room table, in the construction of the coffee table, woven into the pillows, and throughout the lamps and light fixtures.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1.jpg" alt="Manhattan renovation, Murray Hill, home, design, living room, couch, rug" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35655" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the strength of the view through the windows, Tara helped her clients achieve an uncluttered look and did not use much wall art. To inject some creativity, they picked out well-designed furniture that could almost double as art pieces. The blue chairs from designer Walter Knoll function like little works of art that you can sit in, as do the Roche Bobois sofas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1.jpg" alt="Manhattan renovation, Murray Hill, home, design, living room, open floor plan, dining room" width="1000" height="1400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35656" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-214x300.jpg 214w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-600x840.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-723x1012.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-585x819.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The heavy linen drapes were replaced with near-translucent fabric, letting in more light and giving a gossamery feel. And the view will never be obscured. The curtains are purely for appearances; they are locked into the ceiling and floor and cannot be moved, ensuring the &#8220;wow&#8221; moment when guests get a first glimpse of the cityscape. &#8220;They literally never want to close the windows,&#8221; Tara said.</p>
<h3>The key to remodeling success? Team communication.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Tara, their Sweeten contractor was a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great communicator and in constant communication</a> with her and the clients. He was even willing to meet with the client on weekends to keep the project on schedule. With a touch up for the millwork, a fresh coat of paint, and refinishing the floor varnish, it’s a reminder that less often equals more when luxe furniture and lighting make up a dream space.</p>

<h3>Lightening the mood</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I could have done a lot worse than this hand-me-down—a West Village apartment that my mom and dad purchased in 2016. My sister, Lindsay, lived in the studio for a couple of years until she moved in with her boyfriend in Brooklyn. I’d gotten my career in fundraising events off the ground, and I decided to leave my roommates in Murray Hill and move in.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The apartment is in a co-op building that was built in 1915. It’s small—approximately 320 square feet—and had accumulated some </span><span class="s5">questionable design touches from long ago</span><span class="s1">. Paneled walls, painted in a pretty but dark shade of teal, and distressed wood trim gave the place a downbeat vibe. It was so dark that I had at times referred to it as “The Dungeon.” Brightening the space was my priority.</span></p>

<h3>Choosing materials for resale in the future</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s6"><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renovating the studio apartment</a> was a family project, planned with my </span><span class="s1">mom, Reneé, and my dad, John. This was our first renovation in New York City and we were nervous. We didn’t know where to find a contractor or what standard pricing would be. Where to start? To add to the challenge, we decided to keep the budget down by not hiring a designer. I would make most of the design decisions myself. We started by posting our project to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46932" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It’s best to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know the process and design plan</a> before you start a project. I wanted it to feel light, warm, cozy, and fun. It also felt important to create a home that would appeal to future buyers. As much as I love this place, it’s a studio—it likely won’t be my “forever home.” So I tried to pick materials that <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept the kitchen current and timeless</a> and the bathroom neutral. I created a document with inspiration photos and a materials list for each room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared it with our Manhattan contractor</a> as soon as we offered him the job.</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">&#8220;Our contractor had great ideas, and one particular staffer was super helpful sourcing the products I wanted.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My family and I agreed we would tear out the ugly paneling in hopes of <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/studio-grows-into-junior-one-bedroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opening up the studio&#8217;s main living</a> and sleeping space; white walls and recessed lighting would brighten the space. Meanwhile, painting the window in charcoal frames the natural light coming in. </span><span class="s1">Next up was the kitchen, which had newish appliances, but needed most everything else, from repainting the cabinets to new floor tile, countertops, and backsplash. To <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refresh the bathroom</a>, we would paint, replace wall and floor tiles, update the shower, and add a new vanity, mirror, and lighting fixtures.</span></p>
<h3>Discovering hidden arches</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">We were excited when our general contractor got started at the beginning of March 2020. During demolition, we found the arched doorways inside the apartment. We’d had no idea about these beautiful, curved pass-throughs—they’d been covered up with drywall and paneling. It was great to find a bit of the apartment’s original charm still intact. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46937 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To modernize, we focused on lighting and thought about storage (a vanity with storage and a wall-mounted shoe rack)—vital aspects of the project in this tiny space. </span><span class="s1">I gave a lot of thought to creating a mix of open and closed storage. All the pretty stuff goes on the open shelving, and everything unsightly or rarely used has a spot to hide in.</span></p>
<h3>Renovating during COVID-19</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Once we’d started working, the biggest challenge we had was dealing with COVID-19. A couple of weeks after our demolition phase, New York City shut down. Our Sweeten contractor was helpful in dealing with all the new health-related laws, as well as our co-op’s rules. As the pandemic escalated, only a few workers were allowed on-site, staying distanced; toward the end, it was only one worker at a time.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46929" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I ended up leaving Manhattan to quarantine at my family’s home, and as the situation worsened, most design choices had to be discussed over text, email, or FaceTime. Our contractor had great ideas, and one particular staffer was super helpful in <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sourcing the products</a> I wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">After a last-minute decision to change the floors, within a few hours, I found floor samples, ordered them for curbside pickup, chose, and ordered the boards so our contracting team could pick them up at an NYC location. Our contractor installed them the next day. It was stressful, but I love what we ended up with!</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The challenges of the pandemic pushed our timeline from two months to three, but we didn’t care—we wanted the work to be done safely. Our contractor was <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diligent in our communication</a> emailing us progress photos every week and scheduling FaceTime walkthroughs. He notified our building’s management company and us if loud work was planned so that neighbors could be warned. This was especially important since everyone was working from home!</span></p>
<h3>Reno tips from the homeowner</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Even in these lean and uncertain times, my advice is to add a buffer to the budget—there is always a surprise, or a little project, to add. I love the creative side, picking out materials, and deciding what worked best together. We certainly did not <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep costs under our budget</a>. Not even close! We ended up spending about $70,000 on this project.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the end, thanks to my family, luck, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding our Sweeten contractor</a>, I’m immensely happy! It’s so comforting to come home. I wanted to modernize the apartment, brighten it, and bring it into this decade—and that’s precisely what we did.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you for sharing your West Village co-op renovation with us, Taylor! We love how your 320-square-foot space turned out.</i></span></p>

<h3>Starting a renovation</h3>
<p>Angela, an epidemiologist, moved to Manhattan from New Jersey and started renting. She loved the city so much, she decided to make it her home. She chose to live at The Manor, a 1928 landmark building in the East 40s, for its grand lobby and beautiful casement windows that overlook a neighborhood park and provide natural light. The only thing due for an update? The co-op’s outdated, flawed bathroom.</p>
<div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-16.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45761" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A designer brings ideas for an old bathroom</h3>
<p>She lived in her apartment for several years, doing research and planning before embarking on a renovation. She discovered Sweeten around the same time she found an image of a similar bathroom done by interior designer <a href="https://vonbinteriors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrea Brodfuehrer</a>. “Everything just came together,” Angela said, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she posted her project</a> on Sweeten.</p>
<p>The bathroom wasn&#8217;t in great shape. It had broken tiles, visible pipes, and water shut-off valves near the sink, plus poorly placed ceramic fixtures; like a toilet paper holder installed on the tile wall that was uncomfortably close to the toilet. The outdated bathroom needed storage solutions that worked better than the existing storage areas (the floor, ledges, or open shelving behind the bathroom door.)</p>
<p>Though she knew what she wanted, Angela said, “I barely knew where to start. Seeing <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog posts like the ones on Sweeten</a> gave me some insight into the process and helped motivate me to take the plunge with the renovation.”</p>

<h3>A glamorous, organized white bathroom</h3>
<p>Once she was ready to get estimates and interview contractors, Angela said, “Sweeten client services were there for me, ensuring I found [the contractor] who was the right fit for my project. It helped make the process feel a bit less daunting.” Her Sweeten general contractor was in regular communication with Angela and her designer throughout the process and was responsive to questions, comments, and tweaks along the way.</p>
<p>Stylewise, Angela wanted to keep things simple and classic yet unique. She fell in love with a Kelly Wearstler <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tile</a> that Andrea had shown her and admitted it was her favorite part of the bathroom. By contrast, since the floor tile was bold, she chose a white subway tile for the walls with light gray grout for balance.</p>
<p>Angela also included <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble niches and shelves</a>, including one next to the sink that mimicked one she had seen in one of Andrea’s previous designs. In the shower, she opted for a rain showerhead and a handheld; Andrea also suggested including a hook above the shower niche for yet another shower option.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45750" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Adding bathroom storage solutions</h3>
<p>For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more storage</a>, a space between the shower and the wall that housed some pipes became tucked-away shelves, perfect for towels and toiletries and a hidden toilet paper holder.</p>
<p>At first, Angela thought that a designer wasn&#8217;t necessary for such a small bathroom with no layout change. But now, she would highly recommend it. Once she met Andrea, they clicked right away. “She had amazing ideas and helped pull things together in a way I couldn&#8217;t have myself,” Angela said.</p>
<p>Overall, the project went smoothly, but Angela was surprised at how difficult it was to see the bathroom reduced to rubble. “Once the general contractor put everything back together, though, that phase of the work seemed like a distant memory,” she recalled.</p>

<h3>Finding the right general contractor</h3>
<p>After initially meeting with a few contractors, Angela realized how important it was to nail down what she really wanted in order to ensure she got comparable estimates. It was essential to get a sense of a contractor’s personality and how well they would work together. “Our contractor made a great first impression when he braved an unusually busy day due to the Women’s March to come to see the bathroom and provide an estimate,” she said. “Renovating can be a relatively short but very intense process, so it’s important to find someone you can trust.&#8221;</p>

</ul>
<h3>A living room renovation gives room for a fave sport</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes even man-cave passions are well worth making room for. Designer Bennett Gale knew this when he agreed to help his friend Dan, who had <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased a one-bedroom apartment</a> in a 1960 New York City building, with its remodel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“For the longest time, the only piece of furniture that Dan had—before he even bought a bed—was a pool table,” recalled Bennett, who works as a project manager for a luxury real-estate developer. The dark-wood billiards console—sturdy, angular, and clad in camel-toned felt—was a prized possession and an essential feature in the project. Dan, a finance executive who’d moved into the co-op about a year before starting on the redesign, had made it the apartment’s centerpiece.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A pool table in a Manhattan apartment may sound like a literal elephant in the room, but Bennett, who had been close with Dan since college, understood its importance and was happy to discuss it. The table had a modern design and good bones. With a set of 4 &#8211; 5 table leaves that let it multitask as a dining surface, the nifty four-legged table was also practical—Dan had gathered many a friend around it. The issue was that his otherwise sparsely set living room felt tight when the table was in use. “I wanted to create more space around it,” said Dan. Plus, more elbow room would be useful for pool cues!</span></p>
<h3>Planning an entertainment space at home</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dan and Bennett worked together to post the job on Sweeten and soon hired a contractor. Then they set out to upgrade the co-op into the ultimate bachelor’s pad. (Note: Dan&#8217;s girlfriend has moved in since the renovation—and reportedly, loves the space.) The original scope of the project, Bennett said, grew substantially. “We’d planned to open up the wall between the kitchen and the living room, but once we dug into the plans, it became clear that by taking out a few walls and relocating a closet, we could make better use of the space.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He proposed a full reconfiguration that would knock out a lot of flow-hampering sheetrock, give the kitchen an eye-catching redo, and elevate the living room to become a spacious entertaining hub. The makeover would bring light and a chic, loft-like sprawl to the downtown apartment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Conversations about specifics began in the kitchen. Bennett and Dan put a lot of research into cohesive surfacing choices. “Dark-wood parquet flooring dominates a lot of the space,” Bennett said, “so we lightened up the walls and chose materials that coordinated with the wood.” Dan opted for kitchen cabinets in a custom textured veneer with blond accents; dark matte-bronze cabinet hardware and coordinating lighting fixtures complement the stained wood. The natural marble that Dan settled on for the countertops is a warm white with earth-toned veining that echoes the deep brown pool and dining table.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45404 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="kitchen bar" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Sample testing the countertop materials</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Quality and durability were primary factors. Dan had decided to go “all in” on <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural marble for the countertops</a> and backsplash. “We did countless tests on countertop samples in order to determine whether we should go with honed marble or polished,” Bennett said. “Olive oil, red wine, hot sauce, pickle juice, and soda were tested to observe how it would stain or etch.” Dan chose a matte honed finish, which is more resistant to discoloration and allows scratches and marks to blend. “From multiple slabs, we identified one with as much veining and movement as possible,” Bennett said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With materials picked and sourced, the real work began. The crew opened the kitchen, installed cabinetry and appliances, and created a three-stooled stretch of counter seating on the opening’s living-room side. From there, the apartment’s other unnecessary walls got the sledgehammer. Bennett’s plan included taking out a hallway wall to give more space around the pool table.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To complete the space expansion, the removal of a corner closet revealed a protruding column. Bennett designed a dry bar to fill the accidental niche. “That awkward corner became a great opportunity,” Bennett said. “We negotiated with the contractor to have the bar included in the build-out. It ended up as a great display.” The closet was relocated to an oversized and inefficient foyer.</span></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Choosing the right general contractor team</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is the case in most every home-construction job, the team hit some snags. During demolition, contractors discovered that the electrical wiring needed to be upgraded. Bennett emphasizes the importance of reading and understanding co-op or condo board rules and sharing them with contractors, who must not only work within the regulations, but also lock in the appropriate licenses and insurance coverages for the project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A cooperative relationship between the construction crew and building staff is an absolute must, according to Bennett. “Get the super involved early,” he says. &#8220;These individuals almost always have previous experience with renovations in the building, and can often provide valuable insight on the exact issues you’ll encounter.” Fortunately, Dan received support from Sweeten throughout the process, and from Bennett, his friend (and architect!) “I would have been lost without his experience, guidance, and recommendations, not to mention his help pushing back on the contractors and the building when I needed it,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All challenges aside, though, “I’m very happy with the finished product,” Dan said. “I accomplished exactly what I was looking to do.” </span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Bennett and Dan, for sharing the results of a great collaboration! </em></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you and your client come together?</p>
<p><strong>Piper:</strong> Packet sought an interior design agency to align its growing office space in Lower Manhattan with its dynamic, emerging brand. Packet’s co-founder and CMO, Jacob Smith, reached out to another one of our tech clients (White Ops, who is also a customer of Packet) for a referral, and after noting our work there, gave us a call.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What is the client’s brand?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>Packet creates the high-touch aspect of high-tech — making cloud infrastructure more delightful to consume for the top digital businesses in the world. Clients, partners, and employees needed to experience the brand the moment they entered the office and throughout their journey in the space.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the opening of this new office space?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>The tech company, which was founded in 2014, had recently doubled its staff and was planning on another year of team growth. While the company is about 70% remote, NYC is its headquarters and one of its global “hubs” where the team gathers regularly. When another floor in the building they occupy became available, Packet <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/office-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">immediately grabbed it</a>.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do your new design and the materials used to represent your brand?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>The brand colors dictated our palette but it was important for us as designers to go beyond an easy and obvious link. It was essential to convey their brand experience throughout the space.</p>
<p>When selecting materials for their Manhattan office renovation, the sense of tangible authenticity—a certain “human-ness”—guided our choices. We opted for wood floors with character, felt walls, linoleum work surfaces, and a special dyed-through MDF that you leave exposed (as opposed to painting.) In addition to tactile fabrics, patterns that reference those seen in their cloud data centers further connected the space to the physical aspects of the product and brand.</p>
<p>In terms of space planning, Chapter Interiors strived for activity-based workplace design. Instead of asking the person to adjust to the space; we investigate how clients work and build spaces to suit. This results in an array of environments for employees—spaces that facilitate certain aspects of work and help optimize performance. An example was helping Packet design for different types of work (e.g. talk-heavy sales vs headphones-on engineering) while finding places for people to gather, recharge, exchange ideas, or be active.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> With companies working remotely because of COVID-19, do you foresee companies downsizing their commercial workspaces? How will office spaces change and service in the post-COVID world?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>Yes! Reducing your footprint is an excellent opportunity to redesign your space (and save money.) In the short term post-COVID world, barriers will be erected and procedures will be put in place to minimize germ transmission. The longer-term implications are rethinking why people should go to the office.</p>
<p>Companies still need space for employees to gather. Moving forward, I see workplaces geared towards collaboration, team building, and brand connectivity with consumers and partners. Dedicated desks and independent work while at the office is less and less important. Numerous studies during the pandemic have proven that working from home does not hinder overall productivity.</p>
<p>It makes sense to combine working from home with time at the office. The best analogy I’ve heard so far is that working from home versus going into the office will be similar to eating at home versus going out to a restaurant. Employers need to make coming into the office special by providing spaces that foster activities that are worth traveling for. This ties into our strong belief in activity-based-workplace-design.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How was your vision executed by working with your Sweeten general contractor?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>The site manager was wonderful. From day one it was clear she cared about the quality of work and was very hands-on. Together, we worked to problem-solve several issues to make sure the <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-renovation-costs-pacing-your-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">final product was cost-effective</a>, durable, and displayed craftsmanship. I would love to work with her again!</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you, as a client, work with Sweeten?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>We work with contractors all the time— yet still, find the process of finding the right contractor daunting. For Packet&#8217;s office renovation in Manhattan, I had very targeted needs, and Sweeten helped me quickly vet and compare contractors.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Can you describe the “before” space?</p>
<p><strong>Piper: </strong>Words can&#8217;t describe this space before! It was raw, with filthy carpet and random paint patches throughout. Bad shape… But the potential that Packet saw was great, with pervasive natural light, airy ceiling height, and breathtaking views.</p>

<hr />
<p><em>Guest post by Sweeten homeowner Rachel</em></p>
<h5>A Manhattan duplex remodel (instead of moving)</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is our first home, which we bought about six years ago just after we got married. When we were planning to expand our family, we knew we had to renovate or move. There was enough square footage, but we needed more distinct rooms or spaces. The apartment is a duplex co-op in Greenwich Village which was built in 1910. We love Greenwich Village so much and I really wanted to have the experience of raising a baby here. So, we renovated!</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Living here for so long before the renovation was really helpful since it gave us plenty of time to think about the best possible use of the space. We had a two-bedroom, two-bath, but wanted another bedroom for a baby. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/swap-rooms-better-layout-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old layout didn&#8217;t really work for entertaining</a>, either—the kitchen and dining room were upstairs while the living room was downstairs. Marco and I also wanted our own personal spaces within our home for his hobbies and for my closet/office. Overall, we hoped to create a comfortable family home that met everyone&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I always thought of our apartment as a hidden gem—a colorful, fun place where you could see a little girl growing up, sophisticated yet flexible enough to allow for events like playdates and parties. The general contractors we found through Sweeten were really amazing. On top of being creative problem solvers, they were incredibly nice guys!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The top floor would be a combined kitchen/dining/living area, so the kitchen needed to be functional but also beautiful enough for a dinner party. We hid most of the appliances behind paneled cabinets; an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221; and snack storage were organized inside hallway cabinets outfitted with marble countertops. When we have family-style dinners, we set up the self-serve dishes and bar in those spaces. So, yes, you&#8217;re in a kitchen, but it&#8217;s also an elegant dining room.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h5>Customizing the almost-black kitchen</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I cook a lot and was so excited for the stove. I wanted one of those fancy French stoves that come in custom colors, but they are so expensive! Instead, I found one from a U.S. manufacturer for maybe one-third the price. (They also do custom colors.) The cabinet color was chosen to match the stove, so this appliance is &#8220;hidden,&#8221; too. We wanted something different from the typical all-white kitchen that would also complement the light wood floors. This almost-black shade is just a little more interesting than plain black. It took lots of trips to the paint store for swatches!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We put a lot of thought into maximizing space and brainstorming with our Sweeten contractors. We really pushed them to be creative. I just kept saying, &#8220;We need to hide the trash and we need a spice cabinet. Where can we do it?&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t let up! The answer was wrapping the cabinets around the pillar and also where the lower cabinets end, which created a finished look. There were other details: I don&#8217;t think you can go wrong <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with big molding</a>. I chose the largest size I could find for the ceilings, doors, and floors! It makes a big difference for not a huge cost.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think you can go wrong with big molding. I chose the largest size I could find for the ceilings, doors, and floors! It makes a big difference for not a huge cost.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few challenges, like the flooring. It took a couple of tries to get it just right, including completely refinishing the downstairs floors more than once.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then there was the fireplace, which was very old and didn&#8217;t work. Our contractors figured out it was a faux fireplace that took up space for no reason, so it was removed.</p>
<h5>Matching new and old brick</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also needed to make our brand-new brick match with the brick from 1910. Our contractors came up with a solution that was even better than what we had imagined. We repaired some portions, which was very expensive, and painted the wall solid white, stripping that paint off layer by layer to create the current washed effect. That helped to blend the new and (very) old brick.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom needed updating, too. It was really old with a weirdly-shaped, very deep, mini tub. We installed a beautiful regular-sized tub and shower tile I had seen in another project our contractors had done, which I loved. I pushed hard to put in a double-wide mirror, even though there were a lot of issues with making a recessed cabinet fit the space. I&#8217;m glad I persevered because it makes the room so much bigger.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h5>A bedroom transforms into personal hobby spaces</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marco and I have always believed in having our own spaces. We divided what used to be a huge bedroom into two separate spaces to create his office and my closet. Marco needed his own space where he could work on his hobbies without driving me crazy! He likes to do things that create dust and noise and play his music really loud. He works hard during the week, so he should have a place to do that! The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office is actually soundproofed</a> so he won&#8217;t wake the baby.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32176 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-couch-blue-wall-painting" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-723x482.jpg" alt="blue couch and blue painting on wall and brick wall with metal open shelf" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, Sweeten was great; they continually checked in with us. I knew I could go to them if there was ever an issue with our contractor. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you need to pick finishes in person whenever possible. It&#8217;s really hard to imagine what crown molding, counters, or other elements look like on a computer screen.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Rachel and Marco, for sharing your Manhattan duplex remodel with us!</em></p>

<h3>Starting a renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leah, a lawyer in the finance industry, bought her prewar one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side. She spent several years living in the apartment before embarking on a kitchen renovation. She also redid the floors. “The decisions I made after really living in the space were just better—how I moved in and out of the kitchen, how the rooms communicated with each other,” she said.</p>

<h3>Reaching out for help</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation projects became exhausting, so she took a break—even though the bathroom was disjointed from the rest of the apartment, with its beige tones and frumpy &#8217;70s aesthetic. It also had a dropped ceiling for seemingly no reason, which cramped the small space. “I backed away because it seemed like too much to take on,” she said, but she finally took the plunge and posted her NYC prewar bathroom remodel on Sweeten to find a general contractor.</p>
<h5><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="glass enclosed tub" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31836" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h5>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Raising up a dropped ceiling</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leah envisioned something that was reflective of her co-op building’s beautiful foyer with its marble and clean look. “I think my design was to let the space speak for itself,” she said. The Sweeten contractors she hired set out to raise the ceiling. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t know what we were going to find,&#8221; Leah said. Because they could not find any pipes or any other obvious reason for the dropped ceiling, they were able to raise it again.</p>
<p>She selected classic subway tiles for the walls and a marble top for the vanity. With the floors, the Sweeten contractors made a reassuring discovery—the original tiles were still underneath, and matched the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new creamy hexagon tiles</a> Leah had chosen. It was a confirmation that her design choices were in line with how the bathroom was originally meant to be.</p>

<h3>Adding warmth</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While Leah had planned for white and silver tones, she made a last-minute decision to bring in gold fixtures. “I wanted to add warmth,” she said of the 11th-hour choice. Luckily, she found the renovation process to be far less taxing than she had anticipated. She was in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">daily communication</a> with her Sweeten contractors, who helped solve problems and helped her make those nuts-and-bolts decisions, like how far up the wall the tiles should go. “It was a very collaborative process,” she said.</p>

<h3>Saving for a renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leah decided early on where she would save money (like tile choices) <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with her remodeling budget</a> and where she would spend more lavishly. Because of the small space, she decided on a custom bathtub, which took six weeks to make in South Carolina. “Every bathtub that was standard was made for bigger spaces,” she said. “I needed something that fit my dimensions.” The shower enclosure and tub combination became a show stopping centerpiece of the bathroom and were well worth the wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="bathroom reno" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31832" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-11-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Moving back to the city</h3>
<p>We relocated back to Manhattan several years ago after residing in the Midwest and South for work. It was simply time to return home to our families in the Tri-State area. Bob and I met in NYC while studying for our MBAs, and Bob grew up here. While away, we owned several single-family homes—a few we had renovated—so we weren’t strangers to the process. There was a high likelihood of renovating to make a space our own as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we started the buying phase</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44562" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1.jpg" alt="NYC renovation portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>We rented for a few years until we located an apartment on the Upper West Side that would satisfy our love of prewar architectural details while accommodating modern living. Our home was purchased through an estate sale and we immediately started renovating. It had been updated in the early ‘90s, when the owners created an open floor plan of living room, dining room, and foyer which was a big draw for us. And there are two windows in every room except the bath, so the light was a huge selling point.</p>
<div></div>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Mapping the &#8220;musts&#8221; for an empty nest renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While Bob rents office space, I required a fully functional home office in a dedicated space. Also, a washer/dryer. We lived without them for a few years in Manhattan after having a laundry room in suburban homes, and we didn’t want to do that ever again. Both the kitchen and the bath needed better functionality and major cosmetic updates. Storage was essential throughout the apartment, as well as better lighting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our vision for the apartment was classic and period-appropriate but updated for today. We felt it was important to keep within the prewar aesthetic, including subway tiles, wood flooring, wide baseboard and door frame moldings, classic single-panel doors, radiator covers, and shaker-style cabinets.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44566 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-19.gif" alt="closet turn home office" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>More storage and a tip for staying cool</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The primary bedroom initially had a large double-door closet. We flipped it to be used in the second bedroom next door as a home office. We created built-in drawers and cabinets, as well as added new closets to account for the one given to the home office. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I loved ditching the tub for a large shower stall and completely rearranging the primary bath. We went for a custom industrial-style shower screen, mosaic floor tiles, and classic subway tiles with a twist: a crackle pattern. Plus a black metal grate for heat. The design worked.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">I sourced what I needed at the onset so we weren&#8217;t crunched for time in selecting and getting product delivered in time.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Electrical rewiring was not expected, but it had to be done. Then we replaced all the lighting and added ceiling fans in the bedrooms and kitchen. It’s a trick from the south because you can cut down on A/C bills. And it’s a plus in a prewar building where you can’t regulate the heat in winter.  We went for sleek, custom radiator covers that are great for display on top, too.</span></p>
<p>In the foyer, we extended the closet out by six inches and added shelving on top. So what was non-functional became completely utilized, with tons of space. We added bookshelves in the living room—we love books and are avid readers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44554 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg" alt="stainless steel kitchen counter" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Enlisting Sweeten during a hurdle</h3>
<p>Bob would say the stainless steel countertops surrounding the range are a throwback to a &#8217;50s kitchen we had. Those tops are indestructible! It was the only design element he wished to have a “say” in. Bob is the expert in paint colors. I can give him a palette of 10 colors and he can narrow them down so that they flow together from room to room.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While we had renovation knowledge, every experience has its unexpected nuances. We were very relieved to have <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten as the backstop</a> when needed. It was great to have someone who could assist in holding the contractors accountable. </span><span class="s1">We had problems with the contractor with a leak after moving in. So parts of the kitchen had to be dismantled, the leak fixed, and put back together again. <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> stood by us and made sure the job was completed correctly. </span></p>
<div></div>
<h3>When planning for the unexpected pays off</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I wish I had engaged Sweeten to talk through the contract, which might have avoided several issues. Having a second set of eyes is never a bad idea! For example, while I was very specific on the type of cabinetry I wanted, we found the budget in the contract did not align with reality. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To help alleviate the overage, I hit the sales.  Also, I sourced what I needed at the onset so we weren&#8217;t crunched for time in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selecting and getting product delivered in time</a>. Additionally, we had allocated extra funds for overages and the unexpected.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our new home makes us feel joyful. Our daughter commented that the space is aesthetically a culmination of all of our past homes, with a bit of industrial thrown in. It’s truly who we are at this stage of life, a mix of the past and present: kids grown, empty nesters with a puppy in the house!</span></p>

<h3>Compact living in a junior one bedroom</h3>
<p>Dan and I lived on the Lower East Side for several years in typical rental apartments—tiny, no living rooms, dated kitchens and baths, and windows looking into someone else’s kitchen. In NYC real estate terms, this translates into “cozy!” We’re not big fans of moving, so purchasing an apartment together was always on our minds.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p class="p1">Often, we’d walk past our current apartment building and joke about purchasing a studio there if we could find a relatively cheap unit to gut-renovate. Somehow this apartment showed up in an internet search and met our expectations, so we decided to buy it. We closed on the purchase but lived in our old apartment while the renovations were in progress.</p>

We knew it would need a complete overhaul. Our primary goal was some separation between the living/kitchen area and the sleeping space. We wanted it to feel less like a studio and more like a junior one bedroom.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="large-black-framed-window" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44842 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Claire-bedroom-13-compressed.gif" alt="large black framed window in a white bedroom with barn door after renovation" width="1000" height="674" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44579 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bedroom-5.jpg" alt="junior one bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bedroom-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bedroom-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bedroom-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Making a junior one bedroom work</h3>
<p class="p1">Because of Department of Building regulations, our architect said we couldn’t install full walls to divide the space. After a brainstorm with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/when-do-you-need-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architect</a> and our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractor, we decided to install custom sliding doors fabricated by a vendor. The doors allow us to keep the space open, but we can close them when we have overnight guests or just want some privacy. Though it was challenging to figure out the right door dimensions and make sure the ceiling was even, I think it was a smart investment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44583 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />In addition, we wanted to remove the wall between the kitchen and the living space, fully renovate the kitchen and bathroom, and install new hardwood floors throughout. Fun—not fun—story: we ordered a new toilet online, and it came broken three times in a row. We were only able to get it in one piece when we picked it up at the store.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44581" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2.jpg" alt="Lower East Side renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<blockquote><p>
It’s a dusty business, so live somewhere else during a gut renovation, if possible&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Simple color palette for a small space</h3>
<p>Given the apartment’s small size, I used a limited material palette and color scheme—sort of a mix of Scandinavian, Japanese, and Lower East Side flavors. We went with white kitchen cabinets and tiles, chrome, black hardware, and a red oak floor. My favorite part of the renovation was picking materials and envisioning how each would look in the space. It was hard to find things I liked that fit our limited budget! However, I incorporated interesting textures and colors through decoration and furnishings so it wouldn’t feel too clinical.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44584 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-11.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44582 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-8.jpg" alt="pattern backsplash tile" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44586 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-knook-9.jpg" alt="Eat-in niche" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-knook-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-knook-9-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-knook-9-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>The right contractor for a first-time renovator</h3>
<p>My contractor was resourceful in accommodating our various needs and provided honest recommendations on what was feasible or not. For example, having a soaking tub in the bathroom was very important for Dan since he loves taking baths. Our bathroom door was tiny, so we weren&#8217;t sure how the tub would actually get in. Our contractor figured out how to open up the closet wall next to the bathroom and inserted the tub that way.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44576" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bathroom-1.jpg" alt="Bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h4>Sweeten lends advice and support</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I appreciated that the Sweeten team was approachable and knowledgeable about my first-timer renovator questions. The team hopped on a call to discuss potential contractors and provided useful tips on how to make the hiring decision. They also frequently checked in during the renovation and were available for help as needed.  </span></p>
<h3>Renovation tips: Budget and expectations</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re renovating—even for a junior one bedroom—plan on it taking more time and money than you anticipate—there are always unexpected things that happen as you go through the process. We ended up spending roughly 25% more than the original budget since we added change orders to address issues that came up. Decide on your renovation “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves” and stick with them. It’s a dusty business, so live somewhere else during a gut renovation, if possible, and invest in an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/clean-up-after-major-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">air purifier and a professional cleaning</a> afterward. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t feel pressured to decorate everything right after you move in. Be patient, live with the apartment for a while with existing items, and figure out what you need. Also, buy vintage furniture if you can! </span><span class="s1">Now our new space finally feels like home :) </span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Claire and Dan, for sharing your very first renovation with us!</em></p>

<h3>A full gut renovation</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When we purchased our apartment, we knew that we were going to renovate it.  As someone who loves design, I saw the potential and welcomed the opportunity to take a space and figure out how to best make it work for our family of five including three boys (and two dogs). I did not, however, anticipate we would be undertaking a full gut renovation—and while we had renovated before, those projects were a much smaller scope.</span></p>

<h3>Working with an architect</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before we closed on our apartment, we began working with our <a href="https://www.jwarchitecturedpc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect Jessica Wetters</a> on how to change the layout of the apartment. The plan was to open it up and improve the light and flow. The living spaces would be connected as well as add a bedroom and a half-bathroom. It was clear to our architect that the apartment required a full-gut renovation and that little could be saved. After a few rounds of revising the plans, we arrived at a layout that achieved our objectives.  </span></p>

<h3>Finding the right contractor</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before we found Sweeten, we began working with a contractor on the budget for the project and costs kept going up. We were at the point where we were cutting parts of the project that were important to us (like millwork) and making compromises we weren’t comfortable with in order to stay within budget. I decided to post our project on Sweeten. It would allow me to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add more cost estimates into the mix</a> with their network of general contractors and see if I had unrealistic expectations. </span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4.jpg" alt="Henrybuilt kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44264" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sweeten matched us with three contractors, but after <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interviewing this general contractor</a>, I knew he was the one for our project. Not only did he assure us that he could get us everything we wanted within our budget, but he promised that he would minimize the disruption to our lives and work with our aggressive timeline.   </span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As soon as we hired him, things moved quickly and once we had all of the necessary approvals, we moved into a rental apartment. Demolition began</span><span class="s2"> in February and work was completed over the summer. </span></p>

<h3>Functional and modern</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The first decision we made was the kitchen. I knew I wanted a Henrybuilt kitchen. I love the functionality and feel of our kitchen. We also planned for a black wall in the living room using huge porcelain tile slabs to camouflage our TV and it turned out even better than I expected. I researched industrial factory doors to connect the living room and bedrooms, but it was over-budget (even the reclaimed factory doors I saw were $7,000+) so I had a door made with a similar look for a small fraction of the cost.</span></p>

<h3>Replacing the floors</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In addition to opening up the kitchen, foyer, and living room, we enlarged the size of our master bathroom and added closets in unused space in the master bedroom. Throughout the apartment, we replaced the hardwood floors, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coated the walls</a>, replaced the trim, replaced all of the lighting, and added millwork.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">Even though we lived there without a kitchen which wasn’t optimal, there was no question that it would be worth it in the end. </span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When I told our Sweeten contractor that our rental ended in June and that we wanted to move back in before the apartment was completed, he worked with us to allow us to do that—despite his strong recommendation that we hold off moving in. Even though we lived there without a kitchen which wasn’t optimal—his crew set up a refrigerator in the middle of the apartment—there was no question that it would be worth it in the end. </span></p>

<h3 class="p4">The perfect finished product</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When a couple of unexpected structural issues were discovered during demo that required changes to the layout, our contractor immediately contacted our architect and me and proposed solutions that ended up improving the project. Issues that could have induced panic and delays were addressed efficiently and proactively. Our contractor, our architect, and I met at the apartment nearly every week to discuss progress and make decisions to ensure that the project kept moving forward on schedule. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are thrilled with the results. We achieved exactly the look and feel we were going for and I firmly believe that the process went as smoothly and efficiently as it did, thanks to our contractor, his crew, and our architect.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Smart upgrades for the kitchen and bathroom solve pesky problems</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When Ryan, an editor, and Sophie, a paralegal, envisioned their renovation, they knew they needed to address the problems they inherited from the “quick and dirty reno” completed in 2009, the year Ryan bought the apartment. The advantage of waiting years to renovate? “It was abundantly clear how we utilized the kitchen,” says Ryan, adding “I had 10 years to save up because even a modest renovation like this one isn’t cheap in NYC!” In their 750-square foot, prewar one-bedroom on the Upper West Side, the partners agreed that the odd-shaped kitchen needed rearranging to take advantage of every square inch; and the bathroom required rescuing from a “South Florida Grandma aesthetic.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i> To tackle <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/37791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the project, they posted</a> on </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span class="s2"><i>Sweeten</i></span></a><i>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, and </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169#overview"><span class="s2"><i>chose their contractor</i></span></a><i>. </i></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whoever designed the last renovation really did not think things through. In the kitchen, which is an odd trapezoidal space, the priority was maximizing both storage and counter space, and minimizing clutter. For instance, there was a 24-inch soffit between the top of the cabinets and the ceiling that was just empty space. So we knew we’d need cabinets extending to the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44150 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13.jpg" alt="renovators portrait-new york city" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sink was on a diagonal resulting in a large dead space. And the refrigerator was a huge obstruction at the back of the room and the first thing you see when you enter the foyer. Its positioning made the kitchen seem smaller and it just needed to find a new spot. We weren’t sure if that was possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom was small and dark with very little natural light. The vanity was made of builder-grade particle board that had swollen with moisture, and the medicine cabinet protruded. We were intent on transforming the look and feel of the bathroom—even the toilet was pink! The living room got a refresh with repainted walls, a replastered ceiling, and new sconce lighting.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">The contractor’s millworker was about twice the cost of </span><span class="s3">Ikea and Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, but still about $5,000 less than the cabinets in the next price tier.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the kitchen, I commissioned a one-hour consult with an interior designer, Clare of <a href="https://www.121studio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One to One Studio</a>, while still planning everything out. The designer suggested moving the refrigerator to the corner and relocating the doorway to accommodate the fit. That might seem obvious in retrospect, but to me, it was a revelation. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We went with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/product-101-kitchen-cabinet-door-materials-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinets so everything</a> would look integrated. The odd-shaped kitchen space came with difficult angles, pipes, and protrusions. We went to Ikea to experiment with a layout, but couldn’t get their premade boxes to fit in a satisfactory way. I also tried </span><span class="s3">Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, which had more options in terms of box sizes, but I worried the boxes wouldn’t be delivered in time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor’s millworker was about twice the cost of </span><span class="s3">Ikea and Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, but still about $5,000 less than the cabinets in the next price tier. He was able to build boxes that accommodated the kitchen’s unusual dimensions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen floor tile came from the designer, during our consult. I asked her specifically what I should get since I was stumped by all the options. She recommended black slate tile: durable, attractive, and cheap. Her basic ethos was “make it look expensive without being expensive.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The backsplash, on the other hand, was a splurge. We always </span><span class="s3">wanted</span><span class="s1"> scallop tiles. Initially, we envisioned a teal color but we realized it was just too loud. So we went with a scalloped tile in muted but varied gray tones. The countertop was another more expensive finish: Empira White featured veining we really liked that complemented the backsplash.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophie </span><span class="s3">wanted</span><span class="s1"> slab cabinets without any pulls, and I agreed. By then, I was really <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-selecting-and-ordering-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suffering from decision fatigue</a> and didn’t have the wherewithal to evaluate the merits of different cabinet hardware!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophie chose the kitchen to be clean and streamlined, whereas I wanted the bathroom to have quirkier touches. I put together a sort of mood board where we considered a bunch of looks like intricate marble mosaics, but marble stains and needs a lot of upkeep. Plus, our contractor recommended we get large-format tile, due to some peculiarities of the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We ultimately chose 36”x36” glazed porcelain tile that looks like marble at about $4/square foot, which was pretty reasonable, especially since we tiled up to the ceiling. It also worked well on the floor given the bathroom’s size constraints.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The vanity was more of a splurge, but I justified it because I hadn’t seen other vanities quite like it. And it fit. A 25-inch vanity would have been too small, and a 30-inch vanity would have been crammed in. The Goldilocks vanity needed to be between 25 to 30 inches, but powder room vanities sit comfortably within that range. I just had to pay twice what I’d initially budgeted. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The renovation itself mostly went off without a hitch, from getting board approval to designing it to seeing the project through to completion. Our contractor helped a lot with the paperwork. Between the management company and the board, there were A LOT of forms that I needed to put together. Luckily, the contractor had worked in the building before, which is one of the reasons I hired him. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor was really good at keeping me in the loop and letting me know what was happening and when. Managing and communicating expectations is a big part of a successful partnership. Have a plan before you hire a contractor, know what you want and why you want it, so you’ll have a better idea of where to compromise with your decisions and where not to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the renovation, my downstairs neighbor was particularly helpful. She winters in Florida, and let us stay in her apartment, meaning we didn’t have to find a place to crash. I work from home most days, so I could stay in the building and check out the renovation throughout the day to make sure we were adhering to the plan. Also, I didn’t have to find a place to board my cat, Titus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Besides the clean look, I love how our new kitchen is all integrated. From a functionality standpoint, I’m very pleased with its usability. It easily accommodates two people working at the same time, has tons of storage space and counter space, yet still seems open.</span></p>
