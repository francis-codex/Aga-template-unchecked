<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>We’re back again this week with Part 2 of Nazli and Larry’s historic Brooklyn brownstone renovation in Bedford-Stuyvesant. If you missed it—check out <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part I</a></i></span><span class="s1"><i> where Nazli walked us through their planning process and showed off the foyer and guest suite. Here, she shows off the rest of the parlor floor, including the kitchen, the dining room, and the powder room. Nazli explains the challenge of merging modern and traditional within the confines of a townhouse’s long and narrow configuration. Read on for her thoughts on powder rooms (wackiness is key), decorative mantels (rather pointless), and coming to terms with the budget required to achieve the renovation you want (very tough).</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think the biggest challenge to any renovation is…the renovators obviously. There will always be a push and pull between the architect, the contractor, and the owners. And most of the time, that will yield a better product than any single entity could have envisioned (but not always). I think our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect was fantastic</a> in coming up with some great solutions to space challenges–especially on the parlor floor, where I insisted we needed a half-bath that was nowhere near the kitchen (because, gross), a hall closet, and a kitchen pantry. She really provided a lot of help in making sure the house was up to code and that the spaces flowed. Our contractor (and my husband’s best friend), did an awesome job of value engineering so we could get the most bang for our buck. The decorating of the spaces was left mostly to me and it was interesting trying to figure out my own taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We, like all imperfect clients, wanted this Brooklyn brownstone renovated on a contractor&#8217;s-grade budget. Obviously, we were being silly and went way over budget (and right at what our contractor told us it would cost; we were just deeply in denial about the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of construction</a> in NYC). The mechanicals in a home are so expensive that basically most of the money was gone before we made a single design choice. And for me, I care deeply about the fixtures, finishes, and materials and I wasn’t about to cheap out on the things we had to see and use every day. So just be honest with yourself about what you want and what you’re willing to pay or give up for it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I was most excited about the kitchen<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>if that hasn’t already been made clear. I love throwing huge parties and dinners, and I like to spend my alone time cooking. It’s also a natural gathering spot, so it was exciting to think about getting the most out of the space. Turns out the space configuration of a Brooklyn brownstone made it hard to do that, but it still served us well—I am super happy with a long <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> (11 feet long!), a BlueStar stove, and the different stations for cooking, eating, making coffee, or baking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen is my happy spot and I’ve spent years thinking about what makes a good kitchen. Is this ideal space planning? Nope. Is this my idea of a good time? For sure. The challenge was how to devise an open-plan area that was going to take up so much of the parlor floor without making it feel like a separate room. My solution was to forgo upper <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> so there&#8217;s a clear line of vision from the front of the room all the way to the dining room. This created a storage challenge for me, of course, which we solved with a kitchen pantry. I wanted the pantry to be open so that I could see and access all my ingredients easily, but I also didn’t want a lot of visual clutter. I <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painted</a> the cabinets and shelves a deep gray (same color as the island cabinets), which makes the whole space disappear once I turn out the light. I found a piece of scrap marble at the stone yard which I used for the kitchen backsplash and the countertops along the back wall closest to the pantry. Marble is expensive and hard to maintain, so my thought was to use it in low-use areas to give the look and feel of the material throughout the kitchen without spending that much. For the island and other countertops, I used poured concrete, which is a material I love. Surprisingly, it’s also pretty delicate, but it’s subtle and earthy and I like how it ages. The kitchen is, again, more traditional than I would have preferred, but I think the concrete and the open shelving give it a more modern touch. Also, I fought to get a second sink in the kitchen and am so happy I won that battle. It’s handy to set up a water station so people can grab water or rinse out cups without interrupting my cooking space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I can’t say enough about how much I love these herringbone walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>. We splurged on these floors and went with the less costly white oak for the upstairs floors because…well, just look at them. My original vision was to have the tile floor in the kitchen, but it made more sense to continue the wood on the whole parlor floor and save the tile for the back extension. We mocked up the island with plywood and adjusted it until I was happy with the dimensions—how it felt to go from sink to stove, or how easy it was to take food out of the fridge and place it on the counter. That kind of stuff is important to me, and this was the first time I really got to design my own kitchen for myself. Everything is a bit taller and it suits me just great.</p>
<p>A note on accessibility: I’ve had friends and families with different mobility and impairment issues—whether wheelchair-bound, deaf, or arthritic—and time spent with them has made me very conscious of what it means to design well for many. A landmarked Brooklyn brownstone is a nightmare for anyone with a wheelchair, a walker, or a stroller, and I also saw firsthand some of the challenges that my design choices presented.</p>
<p>The first set of cabinet pulls in the kitchen were a lovely set of straight, minimalist tab pulls. I loved that they gave the kitchen a more modern look. Cue my mother and mother-in-law coming over all the time and struggling with the pulls. They couldn’t grasp the straight pull with their arthritic fingers. I switched them out right away for pulls with a fully curved handle. Now they can just stick their finger under the pull, and a small motion opens the drawers. People keep talking about their &#8220;forever homes,&#8221; but really think about how you, your guests, and your children will have to adapt to the spaces as everyone starts to get older.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other end of our Brooklyn brownstone, and connected to the kitchen, is the dining room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar</a>. We love this room. We really felt like this room, a back extension added in the 1910s, was the reason we bought this place. Then we sadly rebuilt the entire room, but somehow, it’s still our favorite space in the house. So that was a great surprise—buying a house because of one room and then recreating it and still having that be the best spot in the house. It’s our dining room and bar, but we also have space under the dining bench to store all of Nacho’s gear so that he can draw and play at the table while I am cooking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From being in other friends’ homes, I knew that extensions were always freezing cold and hard to heat. All I wanted was Moroccan tile for this room (in fact, for the whole house, but we just didn’t have the budget for that). Everyone fought me on adding radiant heating to the subfloor, but it’s by far the warmest room during the winter. Larry and I often come home and lie down on the floor and accidentally fall asleep! During the summer, this is the room we hang out in while kids run in and out of the house to the backyard. The best surprise? That giant Tiffany stained-glass window, which was hidden by a crappy 1970’s bookcase on the inside and vinyl siding on the outside. As soon as we bought the house, we ripped down the bookcase hoping we’d find a window, and lo and behold, we did. It was in near perfect condition. We completely sealed it with clear glass on the outside to avoid damage and heat loss, as we did with all the other stained glass details around the parlor floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a large fireplace in this room, but I couldn’t figure out how to fit the mantel and Larry’s bar, and after much cajoling, I finally convinced Larry to agree to rip out the fireplace. The mantel has a new home in the living room, where the original had been removed previously. I will say, to the horror of preservationists everywhere, that I wish we didn’t have our mantels—they don’t work, they take up too much space, and they create artificial focal points in every room. Maybe if they were marble, I’d appreciate them more. It’s form without function, which I have no love for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The powder room was a tough one to figure out. I hate the idea of guests having to go upstairs to use the bathroom, and with a small child, it&#8217;s great to have a bathroom on every floor. I think powder rooms should be wacky. This one is tiny, so doing a fun wallpaper or paint color was relatively cheap. I love the electric Cole &amp; Sons Palms wallpaper—it adds a touch of fun to an otherwise formal dining room. I also love the pop of color from the door to the powder room. We hated having the stained glass window facing a dull orange wall because it cast a weird orangey glow into the room. Rather than fight it, though, we decided to paint the door an amped-up version of that wall to tie the colors together in a fun way.</p>

			<h2>From condo to brownstone overhauls, a few of our favorite projects in the neighborhood</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Distinguished by its deep cultural and historic roots, Bedford-Stuyvesant, (aka Bed-Stuy) is a sprawling area also known for 19th-century brownstones, festive block parties, community gardens, and a lively culinary scene. Dough Doughnuts, anyone? The ever-changing neighborhood offers the best of what’s old and new, making it a place worthy of settling down and staying for a while. See how Sweeten renovators did just that and made Bed-Stuy home.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Having their hearts set on a Brooklyn brownstone led <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellamy and Zak</a> to a two-family home in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Restricted by the home’s layout and their budget, the couple focused on the structural changes that would most impact the flow. They flipped the house to make the top two floors the owner’s duplex and renovated the garden floor as the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-rental-in-a-brownstone-gets-fashionable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rental property</a>. Removing doors in the main entryway instantly opened up the space and created a larger living area. Two walls were torn down to expose the full length of the home—and two mismatched walls—which led to repointing and experimenting with painting techniques.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24342 mb-0 size-chrono" title="ktichen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, kitchen, renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/teacher-writes-lesson-kitchen-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ursula</a> loved almost everything about her recently converted two-bedroom condo—except the kitchen. Between the dark mahogany cabinets and flooring, the room felt anything but open. The space was revamped with white glossy cabinets, a geometric backsplash, and a sleek hood where the microwave used to be. Ursula and her Sweeten contractor got strategic when it came to storage: the new island featured three drawers for silverware, cutlery, and dishes, and they made the most of an underutilized area next to the oven by installing a pull-out spice rack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29885 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-11-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedforod-Stuyvesant, living room, brownstone" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It all came down to location during <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marsha and Adam’s </a>house hunt for their family. They searched across Brooklyn and at one point, New Jersey, before realizing the borough was the place for them. The two-family home they finally found in Bedford-Stuyvesant offered the space and light they were looking for, and just had a “good feeling about it.” A full renovation proved necessary to bring the 2,000-square-foot townhouse up to snuff. Taking inspiration from their #1 must-have—white oak floors—the couple set out to create a simple, clean vibe to carry throughout the home, including the all-white kitchen. The rest of the project centered on knocking down walls to open the living room, dining area, and kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_KV_Yard-03-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20478 size-chrono" title="backyard" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_KV_Yard-03-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn backyard, renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>Every New Yorker’s dream? An outdoor space to call their own. Inspired by the gardens of Mexico and Brazil, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-expert-santiago/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K.V. Harper</a> set out to turn the once unusable outdoor space behind her two-bedroom Bedford-Stuyvesant duplex into a lush retreat for entertaining. A framed cedar fence became the defining element of the oasis, encompassing different seating areas and gardening plots. Another fun bonus: The crew found bluestone during the demolition and repurposed it to build out a pathway leading to the yard.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry</a> weren’t expecting a gut renovation when they purchased their single-family home in the Bedford Historic District. While trying to sort out the mechanicals and ductwork, however, they came to the realization starting from scratch would be more efficient overall. To build a home that would grow with them over time, accommodate guests, and most importantly meet their day-to-day needs as a family, they set priorities. For him: the bells and whistles necessary to create a smart home, and for her, the flow and design crucial to making the house fit their lifestyle. The result? A welcoming, open home thoughtful of visiting and family friends. Seriously, the guest room was the first one ready!</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Today’s before and after kicks off a three-part series on a Brooklyn brownstone gut renovation in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. In 2015, Nazli and Larry bought a four-story derelict townhouse and set out to create a home for themselves and their son Nacho. With refreshing honesty on topics ranging from marital disagreement to aging foresight, Nazli shares the behind-the-scenes process of decision-making and what it means to renovate for real life, beyond the photo shoot. The couple—she&#8217;s a consultant for government affairs and he is a broker—envisioned the house as an inviting space for their extended community of family and friends—a home away from home. Read on for Nazli’s take on their plans for the new townhouse, and the full reveal of their guest suite on the second floor. Fittingly, for a family that loves to host, it was the first room finished and ready for occupancy!</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We purchased our home in the <a href="https://www.brownstoner.com/history/bedford-historic-district-approved-by-landmarks-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newly landmarked</a> Bedford Historic District. It was a single-family brownstone, roughly 4,000 square feet, which we converted into a two-family home with a garden rental and a triplex for ourselves. The home was built in 1890 by Bedford-Stuyvesant architect Montrose Morris, who also built the nearby Kelly Mansion. He built many of the premier properties for wealthy families of the time, though the four townhouses he built on our street were apparently more of an exercise in creating middle-class lodging. Our home was uninhabitable at the time of purchase, truly<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no heat, no working bathrooms or kitchen, and just…not in good shape. There were original but defunct fireplaces, beautifully preserved paneling and plaster work on the walls, as well as some stained-glass windows (a happy surprise)<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>but no other details remained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We certainly did not go into our renovation thinking that it would be a gut—we couldn’t afford it and we didn’t think it would be necessary. But while attempting to figure out the mechanicals and ductwork, it quickly became apparent that it would be more efficient to take down all the crumbling walls and start from scratch. It wouldn’t be so much more expensive since the electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems could be done anew, rather than trying to trace them up 130-year-old walls. There was also so much water damage throughout the house that none of the original flooring could be preserved. The house was a mess.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our goals were to meet the basic needs of our family, and tick items off our dream list. My basic vision of a home is a giant kitchen with some other rooms arranged nearby for whatever it is people do outside of a kitchen. Larry was really looking forward to having his own private office, which would allow him to work from home more often and spend more time with our son, Nacho. Our child only cares about fans, so we made sure we had a ceiling fan for him to play with (kidding). Collectively, we love to entertain, so we wanted to make sure we had plenty of space for guests and could host for a while without it feeling like a strain. We also knew that as we and our families aged, our needs would be different, and wanted flexibility in how our spaces were configured to allow for changing needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband and I disagreed on most decisions (seriously, renovation is not for the faint-hearted), but there was also a really nice division of labor around what our priorities were. I could care less about the bells and whistles of a “smart” home, but my husband spent a lot of time and effort getting the house wired up on Nest thermostats, security systems, and a Sonos sound system, etc. It’s totally amazing to be able to hear music throughout the house, or turn the heat on remotely and come home to a warm home after a few days away. On the other hand, I really care about the flow of space and a house design that makes it easy to clean and maintain. I thought a lot about our storage options and made a million mock-ups of the kitchen and what each cabinet should be used for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of how we imagined the home, I definitely pictured a more modern space than what we have, but we realized pretty quickly that the house, even with the few remaining details, called for a different type of treatment. Townhouses are tough: they are long and narrow and lighting is always tricky, and I think we both realized if we wanted an ultra-modern design we should have looked at a different type of property. We wanted to honor the feel of this Brooklyn brownstone and preserve as much of the plasterwork and recreate as much of the molding without feeling closed in—the way that many of the more traditional townhouses made us feel. Certainly, we wanted a design that felt as open as possible, but I’m a stickler for storage and we are not minimalists, so real-life storage solutions were key. This meant large closets in every room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> where possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were lucky enough <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to find</a> our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect through Sweeten</a> and we really wanted her to come on to do drawings and filings because our contractor, who was also my husband’s best friend, really wanted design as he went along. The goal was to create a beautiful space that was flexible to changing tastes. I view the house, beyond some very bold choices in some of the rooms, as a really great blank canvas for great furniture and our art collection. I didn’t want too much millwork or details that would keep the house stuck in one genre forever. Both for ourselves and our changing needs and tastes and for future owners of the home, it’s nice to be able to create a totally different look and feel in the future without having to do major construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s start with the foyer, which is a work in process. I love that when you enter the home, you see the entire floor. The staircase looks so lovely and grand, especially with the black paint and the landing at the bottom of the stairs to emphasize the grandeur of the steps. There was a crazy wood panel fracture with a mirror at the bottom of the stairs but we all thought it was bulky and awkward and it didn&#8217;t seem to be original to the rest of the stairwell. Our architect convinced us (Larry) to get rid of it and our contractor convinced us to rip up that whole wall and expose the brick. I love the sneak peek into the original brick, and how it grounds the space from the frou-frou antique-looking chandelier and the stained glass. I loved using the same ceramic tile from the dining room in the entry vestibule and again—it was all brought together so beautifully by <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painting</a> all of it black.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Like all good Iranians, I made sure the guest room was the first one in the house that was set up, furnished, and made available for use. Guests are sacred in our culture and we started having house guests after the first night in our house, and for about three months straight afterward. I think Larry takes more of an American’s tact towards house guests…like fish, they start to stink after three days. But having them on their own floor with their own bathroom certainly makes it easy to have folks around. Oh, how I love having a guest room. Basically, if you paint any room Benjamin Moore Chelsea Gray, it will be close to perfect. I had a different idea about how this room would look but then I inherited this terrible rug from my father’s house in Tehran and had to redo all the bedding to go with the odd mix of muted colors. I love Persian rugs, don’t get me wrong<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>walking on bare floors isn’t my taste. But we followed the rules for a perfect guest room: make sure the bed is comfy, that the closets are empty so guests can use them for their own stuff, and provide a work desk (so you can hold your best friends hostage for weeks at a time in your home, even if they insist they have to go back to LA to “work”).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This guest bathroom is so delightfully boring that I fall asleep looking at its soothing tones. I wish I pushed harder for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moroccan tiles</a> in here. I think the floors we used, which basically mimic the look and feel of concrete, wash the whole room out. Our architect used these floors in a hotel project and I really dug them; they were cheap and cool, but always remember the scale of a home project versus a commercial project. What may look like a great feature in a larger space may not work in a smaller venue. I usually have a Persian rug down on this floor which gives the room some warmth and life. If you are ever unhappy with the flooring, put a rug on it! I can’t say enough about how much I love these subway tiles though<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>they are just varied enough to give them a real handmade look rather than the flat subway tiles we usually see. They come in a gorgeous gray and black as well<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>I failed in not using them in more spots throughout the house; that may be a future project. I love the shower as well, we made it nice and big so that Nacho could have fun in there. We also built a large bench along it with a grip bar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our moms visit often, and I find bathtubs to be really dangerous for the senior citizen crowd. We felt good about having a step-in shower and adding features that would make it safe for both Nacho and the grandmas. It’s lovely having the windows in the bathrooms after years of using interior bathrooms with poor ventilation, though we haven’t figured out a good solution for the wood window trim, which is constantly getting wet and will probably crack or mold in the future. I also highly recommend an integrated sink when you have filthy toddlers—makes clean-up so much easier. This was the top half of a vanity and sink combo I bought. We ended up hating the vanity, so I just had our contractor make us a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinet</a>, which is lovely.</p>
