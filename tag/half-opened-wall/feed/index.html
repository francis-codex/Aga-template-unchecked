</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><strong>Where:</strong> Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York<br />

<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> Living room renovation to expand + kitchen remodel in a 900-square-foot co-op<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><strong>Notable:</strong> The remodel transformed a cramped living room into a swanky billiards chamber.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><strong>Result:</strong> An open kitchen, a dry bar with party potential and plenty of room to cue pool</span><span class="s2"><br />

</ul>
<h3>A living room renovation gives room for a fave sport</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes even man-cave passions are well worth making room for. Designer Bennett Gale knew this when he agreed to help his friend Dan, who had <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased a one-bedroom apartment</a> in a 1960 New York City building, with its remodel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“For the longest time, the only piece of furniture that Dan had—before he even bought a bed—was a pool table,” recalled Bennett, who works as a project manager for a luxury real-estate developer. The dark-wood billiards console—sturdy, angular, and clad in camel-toned felt—was a prized possession and an essential feature in the project. Dan, a finance executive who’d moved into the co-op about a year before starting on the redesign, had made it the apartment’s centerpiece.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A pool table in a Manhattan apartment may sound like a literal elephant in the room, but Bennett, who had been close with Dan since college, understood its importance and was happy to discuss it. The table had a modern design and good bones. With a set of 4 &#8211; 5 table leaves that let it multitask as a dining surface, the nifty four-legged table was also practical—Dan had gathered many a friend around it. The issue was that his otherwise sparsely set living room felt tight when the table was in use. “I wanted to create more space around it,” said Dan. Plus, more elbow room would be useful for pool cues!</span></p>
<h3>Planning an entertainment space at home</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dan and Bennett worked together to post the job on Sweeten and soon hired a contractor. Then they set out to upgrade the co-op into the ultimate bachelor’s pad. (Note: Dan&#8217;s girlfriend has moved in since the renovation—and reportedly, loves the space.) The original scope of the project, Bennett said, grew substantially. “We’d planned to open up the wall between the kitchen and the living room, but once we dug into the plans, it became clear that by taking out a few walls and relocating a closet, we could make better use of the space.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He proposed a full reconfiguration that would knock out a lot of flow-hampering sheetrock, give the kitchen an eye-catching redo, and elevate the living room to become a spacious entertaining hub. The makeover would bring light and a chic, loft-like sprawl to the downtown apartment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Conversations about specifics began in the kitchen. Bennett and Dan put a lot of research into cohesive surfacing choices. “Dark-wood parquet flooring dominates a lot of the space,” Bennett said, “so we lightened up the walls and chose materials that coordinated with the wood.” Dan opted for kitchen cabinets in a custom textured veneer with blond accents; dark matte-bronze cabinet hardware and coordinating lighting fixtures complement the stained wood. The natural marble that Dan settled on for the countertops is a warm white with earth-toned veining that echoes the deep brown pool and dining table.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45404 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="kitchen bar" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Sample testing the countertop materials</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Quality and durability were primary factors. Dan had decided to go “all in” on <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural marble for the countertops</a> and backsplash. “We did countless tests on countertop samples in order to determine whether we should go with honed marble or polished,” Bennett said. “Olive oil, red wine, hot sauce, pickle juice, and soda were tested to observe how it would stain or etch.” Dan chose a matte honed finish, which is more resistant to discoloration and allows scratches and marks to blend. “From multiple slabs, we identified one with as much veining and movement as possible,” Bennett said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With materials picked and sourced, the real work began. The crew opened the kitchen, installed cabinetry and appliances, and created a three-stooled stretch of counter seating on the opening’s living-room side. From there, the apartment’s other unnecessary walls got the sledgehammer. Bennett’s plan included taking out a hallway wall to give more space around the pool table.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To complete the space expansion, the removal of a corner closet revealed a protruding column. Bennett designed a dry bar to fill the accidental niche. “That awkward corner became a great opportunity,” Bennett said. “We negotiated with the contractor to have the bar included in the build-out. It ended up as a great display.” The closet was relocated to an oversized and inefficient foyer.</span></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Choosing the right general contractor team</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is the case in most every home-construction job, the team hit some snags. During demolition, contractors discovered that the electrical wiring needed to be upgraded. Bennett emphasizes the importance of reading and understanding co-op or condo board rules and sharing them with contractors, who must not only work within the regulations, but also lock in the appropriate licenses and insurance coverages for the project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A cooperative relationship between the construction crew and building staff is an absolute must, according to Bennett. “Get the super involved early,” he says. &#8220;These individuals almost always have previous experience with renovations in the building, and can often provide valuable insight on the exact issues you’ll encounter.” Fortunately, Dan received support from Sweeten throughout the process, and from Bennett, his friend (and architect!) “I would have been lost without his experience, guidance, and recommendations, not to mention his help pushing back on the contractors and the building when I needed it,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All challenges aside, though, “I’m very happy with the finished product,” Dan said. “I accomplished exactly what I was looking to do.” </span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Bennett and Dan, for sharing the results of a great collaboration! </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Glossy IKEA cabinets, parquet floors, and smart material swaps led the way in this Prospect Heights renovation.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">First-time homeowners Jill and Aaron landed a sunlit co-op (with parking!) in Prospect Heights. The downside seemed daunting: a faux-wood-and-laminate-counter combo in the 1960s kitchen and thick gray tile throughout the small bathroom. With no idea where to start and trepidation about finding a contractor online, Jill came to Sweeten to hire a team who could re-think their galley kitchen and gut the old bathroom. Read on for Jill’s take on their bright new space!</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/glossy-ikea-cabinets-shine-in-a-brooklyn-kitchen-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19805" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/jill-kitchen-2.jpg" alt="ikea cabinets" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/jill-kitchen-2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/jill-kitchen-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Jill in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</span></i><span id="more-19767"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We lived in a brownstone garden apartment in Prospect Heights for six years before seriously looking to buy. Over six months, we spent every weekend checking out open houses and coming to terms with what we could actually afford (Move-in ready two-bed/two-bath in Park Slope? Keep dreaming!) After getting outbid on two apartments, the third time really was the charm. We were officially in contract for a one-bedroom in a doorman co-op building three blocks away from Prospect Park (and our current apartment). It had a space we could convert into a den, extra closet room, tons of natural light, and every New Yorker’s dream: parking! The only downside was that it hadn’t been updated since the ‘60s and needed a complete overhaul. Now what?!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19737 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="sweeten_jill_kitchen_bathroom-before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19738" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_jill_kitchen_bathroom-before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of our friends had done renovations so we didn’t have any recommendations to go on for a contractor. We reached out to a few random ones we found online, but we hadn’t seen any of their work and didn’t feel like we could really trust them. I was so nervous someone was going to take advantage of us since we hadn’t done this before.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s when a friend told us about </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we decided to </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1745" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We had never owned an apartment before, let alone renovated one, and we needed all the help we could get. After a quick budget check (the Sweeten team helped us realize we were completely unrealistic in how much the renovation would cost), we were matched up with </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Kris</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We loved that he had done work in our neighborhood, and it seemed to match our modern style. Plus all of his reviews said he finished his work on time, and since we would be paying rent on top of a mortgage until we could move in, that was music to our ears.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we met with Kris, he really listened to what we wanted to do and was quick to point out if something wouldn’t be possible. After walking the space with him, we agreed on a game plan: close off the wall between the galley kitchen and the dining room, open up the wall between the kitchen and living room, make a sliding door for the bathroom to maximize the space, extend the parquet floors into the kitchen and closets, and gut everything else! Almost as soon as we closed, his team was on-site and starting demo work.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since we knew this wasn’t our forever home, we tried to stick to a budget and not go too overboard. Kris helped us make all our decisions with the bottom-line and timeline in mind. New hardwood flooring would have been nice but the parquet flooring could just be refinished. Custom cabinets would have been gorgeous in the small kitchen, but the glossy IKEA cabinets we chose would still look great.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would have loved marble flooring in the bathroom, but ceramic tile wouldn’t need any maintenance. There were definitely areas where we splurged though: For one, Aaron got his wish for higher-end appliances and quartz countertops. My must-haves included an Italian glass backsplash and a new soaking tub.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We were lucky our rental was close by, so we could stop in anytime and check on the progress. Kris was always there to meet us and show us how things were going and checked with us even if minor changes had been made. There were so many times we questioned whether we had made mistakes, but keeping in close contact with Kris and having him walk us through the progress really gave us hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, Kris was true to his word. We were able to move in after just six weeks and stay on budget. Now, when we hear some of our friends’ stories about their contractors and what a nightmare renovating was for them, we feel very fortunate and even talk about taking on a renovation again!</p>
