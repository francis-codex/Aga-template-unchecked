<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Dallas </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p><span class="s1">Dallas is the ninth-largest city in the United States. It’s the headquarters for multiple Fortune 500 companies like American Airlines. There’s the Dallas Cowboys (as well as real cowboys!) And of course, there’s BBQ. Dallas is a thriving city and a great place to renovate your dream home. <span class="s2">Sweeten</span>&#8216;s guide to 2021 Dallas remodeling costs</span><span class="s3"> provides a jumping-off point to get you on your way with estimates from Sweeten and the <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">2021 Cost vs Value Report</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Developing a budget is your first step to your dream Dallas home. Sweeten contractors will want to sit down with you and inspect your home to reach an accurate number. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a quick overview of budgets for some typical renovation projects:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Gut renovation: starting at <strong>$80—$100</strong> per square foot (psf)</span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Budget kitchen remodel: starting at &#8211; <strong>$15,000</strong> (for a 75-100 sf space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: starting at <strong>$25,000—$30,000</strong> (for a 75-100 sf space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">High-end kitchen remodel: starting at <strong>$40,000</strong> (for a 75-100 sf space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Budget bathroom remodel: starting at <strong>$8,000—$15,000</strong> (for a 35-square-foot space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: starting at <strong>$15,000—$25,000</strong> (for a 35-square-foot space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">High-end bathroom remodel and expansion: starting at <strong>$30,000</strong> (for a 35-square-foot space) </span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Deck composite: <strong>$19,000</strong> or <strong>$60</strong> psf</span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">Wood deck: <strong>$13,000</strong> or <strong>$40</strong> psf</span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Keep in mind that every professional contractor will want to have a detailed conversation with you. They will also inspect your home before developing an estimate specific to your needs and wants.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up and your material order starts at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s7"><b>“</b></span><span class="s1">With the lockdowns from covid, we saw companies cut production and manpower with the expectation that construction would slow down (which it did not),” </span><span class="s8">Dallas-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6958#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s9">Sweeten contractor Joel</span></a></span><span class="s7"> said,</span><span class="s1"> “and it took awhile to ramp up production.” With a large influx of people moving out of the coastal cities and into the South and Midwest, “there’s been an increase in housing demand making quality labor more expensive.” </span><span class="s7">Overall, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6896#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s10">Sweeten contractor Kyle</span></a>, who is also based in Dallas, <b>“</b></span><span class="s11">Costs are going up in today&#8217;s current environment for: the whole home, the kitchen, and the bathroom.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p9"><span class="s1">Dallas home remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A total gut renovation in Dallas that brings your home down to its bare bones and remodels it to your liking, starts at <strong>$80—$100</strong> psf. For a home that has budget finishes, this means materials such as laminate flooring and countertops, value-brand appliances, and basic tiles from big box stores like Home Depot. These scenarios, however, are dependant on the scope of work and existing conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although a gut renovation is a big project, consider doing it all at once to get you the best bang for your buck. You&#8217;ll also have your dream home much quicker than renovating room by room. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">As a guide, </span><span class="s12">Joel</span><span class="s1"> advises clients to tie the price of their kitchen (or bathroom) renovation to the price of their home. You should only spend between 10 and 20 percent of the value “to really cap the budget at the return on investment,” </span><span class="s12">Joel</span><span class="s1"> said. So for a <strong>$300,000</strong> home, aim to spend between <strong>$30,000</strong> and <strong>$60,000</strong> on a bathroom or kitchen remodel, which will be a major slice of a gut renovation project. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Before getting started, general <span class="s2">contractor Kyle</span> suggests homeowners research other recent remodels in the area to see what materials and appliances were used. This is important if you want to resell quickly so you don’t end up with a budget-level renovation in a high-end area or vice versa. If this is your forever home, then your personal taste is more important than whoever you might sell to years later.  </span></p>
<h3 class="p9"><span class="s1">How much a Dallas kitchen remodel costs per square foot in 2021</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li11"><span class="s13"></span><span class="s14">A kitchen renovation i</span><span class="s5">n the budget range can start at <strong>$10,000</strong> and reach <strong>$15,000</strong>. This would apply to a 75-100-square-foot room. To get a new kitchen at this price, it needs to be a rip-and-replace job, meaning a layout of the kitchen must stay the same with pipes and appliances remaining where they are. Cabinets are the highest ticket item in a kitchen budget, said </span><span class="s12">Joel</span><span class="s5">. To keep costs down, cabinets can be re-stained or re-painted. The next upgrade is pre-fab followed by semi-custom. Fully custom costs the most, he said.</span></li>
<li class="li11"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">A mid-grade kitchen remodel in Dallas at the same square footage has costs starting at <strong>$25,000—$30,000</strong>. What does a mid-grade kitchen look like at this starting cost? The kitchen layout must remain the same as a rip-and-replace: swap your old oven for a new one and your old sink for a new sink. You can get a stainless steel sink with a single-lever faucet, laminate countertops, a built-in microwave, new appliances, custom lighting, and semi-custom cabinets. An island could also be added. Moving plumbing, gas, and electrical, reconfiguring the layout, or choosing custom features will increase the budget.</span><span class="s15"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p12"><span class="s5">“A kitchen with upgraded material and selections, as well as special additions such pot fillers, custom-built islands, under cabinet lighting, etc. can drive up the cost to <strong>$50,000</strong> and higher,” says Sweeten contractor Kyle.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li11"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">For an upscale kitchen that is 75-100 square feet, labor costs and a refresh with select high-end materials such as marble or quartz countertops, imported backsplash tile, and high-quality fixtures start at <strong>$40,000</strong>.</span><span class="s15"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">The upscale kitchens Kyle has worked on were budgeted from <strong>$50,000</strong> and up. A big chunk of those budgets were custom-made cabinets as well as quartz countertops and expensive backsplashes. “Adding French doors or moving walls to create a larger kitchen” also brings up the price, Kyle said. As will above and below cabinet lighting, moving plumbing, and custom-built islands.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">There are plenty of variables in most materials, according to Sweeten contractor </span><span class="s12">Joel</span><span class="s1">. For example, with quartz you can spend <strong>$2,000</strong> or <strong>$7,000</strong> depending upon the quality. “It just comes down to not overbuilding for your house,” </span><span class="s12">Joel </span><span class="s1">advised.</span></p>
<h3 class="p9"><span class="s1">How much a Dallas bathroom remodel costs per square foot in 2021</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">At the budget level, expect a rip-and-replace bathroom with no behind-the-wall surprises to start at <strong>$8,000—$15,000</strong>. These are typically smaller master baths or guest bathrooms at 35 square feet. The layout will remain the same where plumbing doesn’t move, Kyle said. This budget won’t include any issues like leaks or mold discovered once the project begins. Materials will include a prefabricated vanity, ceramic tile, and fixtures from big-box stores.</span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">In the Dallas area, a 35-square-foot mid-grade bathroom can start at <strong>$15,000—$25,000</strong>. The average cost for this price range remodel is about <strong>$22,866</strong> or <strong>$653</strong> psf with the same dimensions, according to the 2021 Cost vs Value Report. The key to a budget in this range is rip-and-replace. This means keeping the layout the same and swapping out an old toilet for a new one, an old vanity for a new one, etc. That way, no expensive plumbing work is needed.</span><span class="s6"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can install a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. More than 55 percent of your budget </span><span class="s3">can be recouped in the value the project adds to your home.  </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li11"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5">For a high-end bathroom remodel and expansion, the cost can start at <strong>$30,000</strong>. This budget includes a three-piece bathroom (tub/shower combo, toilet, and sink) for a typical 5’ x 7’ space. The cost increases with features including a double vanity, creating a separate shower from the tub, specialty tile, a custom vanity, or a toilet with additional functions.</span><span class="s15"><b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Cost drivers are things like removing an existing tub or shower to install a new standalone tub,” said Sweeten contractor Kyle. It can also include building larger showers, moving walls to expand bathroom size, custom vanities, and frameless glass shower enclosure.</span></p>
<h3 class="p13"><span class="s1">2021 costs to adding outdoor space to a Dallas-area home</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dallas is a city perfect for outdoor entertaining, whether it’s a crisp winter night in front of the fire pit or a cold beer paired with a hot summer evening. An outdoor area is often the cherry on top of a dream home remodel. It’s the project to really let your creative juices flow. There are endless options to make your outdoor area your own with extensive outdoor kitchens, gas fireplaces, fans and misting systems for cooling, custom lighting, and landscaping. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A basic wooden deck will likely cost <strong>$49</strong> psf or <strong>$15,678</strong> for something in the 320 square foot range, according to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report. A deck made from composite, a mix of wood product and plastic, will cost just under <strong>$20,857</strong> for the same size or <strong>$65</strong> psf. This material tends to last longer and requires less maintenance. </span></p>
<h3 class="p13"><span class="s1">2021 Dallas remodeling costs: Permits</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dallas is experiencing a lot of new building construction. This has resulted in a more rigorous approval process compared to approvals for existing homes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are numerous cities and towns that make up Dallas. Each one has its own building department and its own fee structure for permits. Your Sweeten contractor will likely put an estimate in the budget for building permits, which will be determined by your end costs or square footage of your project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The upmarket suburb of <a href="https://www.hptx.org/179/Fees"><span class="s2">Highland Park</span></a> bases building permit costs on square footage. The permit for a 200 square foot kitchen renovation costs <strong>$490</strong>, according to Highland Park’s calculator.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the city of Addison,<span class="s2"> </span><a href="https://addisontexas.net/sites/default/files/fileattachments/development_services/page/10881/fee_schedule_for_bldg_permits.pdf"><span class="s2">building permit fees</span></a> for a project with a budget between <strong>$2,000</strong> and <strong>$25,000</strong> will have a base cost of <strong>$115</strong> with an additional <strong>$23</strong> per <strong>$1,000</strong> for estimated costs over <strong>$2,000</strong>. That means the permit for a <strong>$20,000</strong> mid-grade bathroom remodel will cost <strong>$529</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building permit fees in <span class="s2">Cedar Hill</span>, southwest of the city’s center, are determined by square footage. There is a set fee of <strong>$400</strong> for any renovation of less than 1,250 square feet. For each additional square foot over 1,250, the permit increases by <strong>$.60</strong>. After 2,500 square feet, it increases by <strong>$.40</strong>.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date NYC</span><span class="s2"> </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Imagining your dream kitchen is easy; budgeting for it is complicated. If you&#8217;re planning a kitchen remodel, we&#8217;ll help you understand your options, and offer guidance on major expenses and hidden costs you may encounter. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">From building requirements to permits and design, here are the average kitchen renovation costs to expect in NYC. These figures are broken out by finish level, and are based on Sweeten renovations: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen renovation costs: Starting at <b>$25,000 </b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen renovation costs: Starting at <b>$35,000</b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen renovation costs: Starting at <b>$65,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Start planning your kitchen renovation now. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of many construction materials and fixtures. For homeowners interested in remodeling, it’s smart to quickly sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. We also advise locking in a start date on the contractor’s calendar. Waiting could lead to longer delays, and even more severe price inflation on materials.</span> <em><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection—at no cost to you.</span></em></p>

<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">From budget to high-end kitchen appliances and finishes </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Appliances, fixtures, and finishing materials all lie on a spectrum, whether you&#8217;re doing a budget kitchen remodel or a high-end one. Your choice of quality level (often called &#8220;finish level&#8221;) is a major factor in the cost of a kitchen renovation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Budget” kitchen materials are generally off-the-shelf items from “big box” stores or IKEA. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Mid-grade” kitchen materials balance cost with quality. Examples include engineered wood flooring and products from GE, Caesarstone, Kohler, or Benjamin Moore. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“High-end” kitchen materials prioritize quality over cost. Products include hardwood flooring or marble, and brands like Bertazzoni, Ann Sacks, and Farrow &amp; Ball. This category may also include special materials sourced from overseas suppliers, and fully custom fabrications.</span></p>

<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">How much do materials for a kitchen renovation cost?</span></h3>

<ul class="ul1"></ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A note about cabinetry: In high-end kitchens that feature custom millwork, the cabinetry often accounts for a high percentage of both materials and labor costs. The starting point for basic custom cabinetry is <b>$1,000</b> per linear foot. There are many other factors—drawers are costlier than shelves, and features such as Lazy Susans, pull-out pantries, specialized compartments, and soft-close hinges all increase costs. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Custom cabinets are not just for large houses; apartment owners with limited kitchen depth may benefit even more by going custom. Shallower cabinets can fit tighter spaces, while deeper cabinets can hold larger dinner plates and platters. You may also have an odd-shaped space or awkward corner that you&#8217;d like to accommodate with a cabinet, to maximize a small kitchen&#8217;s storage. Choices like these require custom work, because prefabricated cabinets offer fewer options.

<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Kitchen renovation costs for permits, design, and behind-the-scenes items</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The average kitchen remodel costs are comprised of both visible and invisible items. Here are the &#8220;invisible&#8221; behind-the-scenes budget items to keep on your radar.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Building requirements</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Building boards / HOAs can play a significant role in dictating design and budget needs for apartment owners. These requirements can range from insurance coverage minimums, which limit your ability to work with professionals who aren’t carrying high-value insurance policies, to alteration agreements that require anyone doing any work in the building to have far-reaching coverage for problems they may never encounter, like asbestos removal or collapse scenarios.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive requirements tend to have higher operating costs and can meet higher insurance requirements, more stringent debris removal expectations, limited noise and hours-of-work requirements, and stricter parking rules. While there is no exact figure on this, you may see this translate into higher rates overall for teams that can meet those demands.</span></p>
<h4>City permits</h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Plumbing services:<b> $2,000 –</b> <b>$3,500. </b> Possibly higher, if you have more than the usual number of plumbing fixtures. </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Plumbing permits: <b>$2,000 –</b> <b>$5,000 </b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Electrical permits: <b>$900</b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Asbestos inspection: <b>$500</b> – <b>$1,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The City’s Department of Buildings requires a permit for any plumbing work that exceeds a minor repair or a direct swap of a similar fixture. Adding outlets or electrical circuits will require an electrical permit. You may also need an asbestos inspection, depending on your building’s requirements and any work that requires opening the walls.</span></p>
<h4>Design costs for kitchen renovation</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the design stage, you&#8217;ll collaborate with the professionals you hire, who will create detailed drawings for all the tradespeople to follow. The design will cover details of the room footprint, plumbing, cabinetry, counters, sinks, backsplashes, flooring, lighting, hardware, and appliances. Kitchen renovation design costs will depend on the scope, and also who you hire. In some cases, your Sweeten general contractor will have design experience and will be able to make recommendations and draw up basic plans. For a higher level of service, some general contractors operate full-service design/build firms, with dedicated designers on staff. Some contracting firms also have architects on staff; many can refer an architect. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">If you are considering major layout changes, such as removing walls, rerouting gas or plumbing lines, and rewiring electrical, you are looking at spending at least <b>$32,000</b> for a basic kitchen gut. If you are considering this kind of transformative work, you’ll need architectural designs from a registered architect and to plan for the cost of permits, building approvals, high insurance coverage requirements, and more involved oversight from your general contractor. </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">These “soft costs”—expenses critical to the success of the work but often invisible or unforeseen—can represent 15 to 20% of the total cost of a kitchen renovation.

<h4><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04.png"><img decoding="async" title="cost-estimate-of-demolition-and-site-preparation" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04.png" alt="Cost estimate of demolition and site preparation" width="1080" height="551" class="alignnone wp-image-51063 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04.png 1080w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04-300x153.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04-600x306.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></a></h4>
<h4>Demolition and site prep</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the site prep stage, your general contractor needs to do significant work behind the scenes to ensure that your kitchen renovation maintains its value over time. Old materials and fixtures need to be pulled out and disposed of—this can be complicated on busy city streets with limited parking. Your contractor will probably need to strip the walls and flooring in order to frame and level the room. This step is labor-intensive, typically costing around<b> $4,000</b>. Other site prep includes protecting surfaces and valuables outside the renovation area, fixing any problems discovered within the walls, and adding insulation or waterproofing.</span></p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is the main event. High-quality materials are only as good as the installation—if hinges are not properly aligned on drawers or cabinets, or if the shelving is not completely level, these faults can make the work look shoddy, can make your kitchen harder to use, and can lead to your expensive fixtures aging poorly. Appliances are often installed by the store where you made the purchase (as a built-in cost or an added delivery/installation fee), while countertop suppliers often also manage installation. If installation costs aren&#8217;t included in an item&#8217;s purchase price, they&#8217;ll typically fall under the “general construction” or “labor” budget and be handled by your general contractor.</span></p>
<h3>Behind-the-scenes kitchen renovation costs</h3>
<h4>Overhead costs</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">General contractors always factor in a percentage of the project to cover overhead costs, including insurances, administrative support, and the inevitable costs of growing a business. Sweeten contractors range from two-person crews to firms employing dozens of professionals (including designers, project managers, millworkers, laborers, bookkeepers, and operations staff). No matter the size of your contractor’s business, you will absorb some of the cost increases they bear from year to year.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s6">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span></a><span class="s1"> explained that as a business grows, costs also go up. “Insurances increase yearly, and anything related to MEPs (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) has also increased a bit as these subcontractors—especially plumbers—have seen an increase in their costs.” This is because the rules have become more stringent and there needs to be “more eyes on the project.” Additionally, he mentions, “Buildings are being more stringent on their [insurance] requirements which cause us to keep up with those needs.”</span></p>
<h4>Raw material costs</h4>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, the industry is affected by global trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For 2021, Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as the main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts mainly due to Covid related issues, from what we have seen,&#8221; said <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span>. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;</span></p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions about kitchen renovations in NYC</h3>
<h4>How long does a kitchen remodel take?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anywhere from 3 weeks to 4 months, depending on the complexity of your project. Will you be altering the room’s footprint? Changing or adding electric wiring, plumbing, or gas lines? Ordering custom cabinetry or millwork? Each of these options will add significant time. You may also encounter delays with the city’s permitting process, or with permission from your building’s board. </span></p>
<h4>Do you need a permit to remodel a kitchen?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ll be changing the kitchen’s footprint, making changes to wiring, gas lines, or plumbing, or removing asbestos, you’ll need the appropriate permits from the city. If you live in an apartment building, you’ll almost certainly need approval from the building’s board for any construction work. Discuss with your Sweeten general contractor if they’ll assist with the permit process which is typically 10% of the budget. </span></p>
<h4>How do I remodel a kitchen on a budget?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to make a clear, prioritized list of must-haves and nice-to-haves. Next, you should think about your wishes for appliance quality, quality of materials and fixtures, and overall finish level. Explore scaling back the biggest budget items: footprint changes, changes to wiring/plumbing/gas, custom cabinetry, and millwork, high-end appliances. Your Sweeten general contractor may help find creative solutions—like Ikea cabinets with a similar look to the custom ones you were considering, or ways to accomplish your goals without moving walls. Sweeten recommends setting aside a 10% contingency budget, so you won&#8217;t have to worry about unwelcome surprises.</span> Ready to budget for your NYC kitchen renovation costs?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider <em>all</em> of the materials (not just the tile itself!) plus labor to get a true picture of what it&#8217;ll cost to tile a bathroom</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49028" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3.jpg" alt="tiling costs" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When budgeting for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/measure-for-bathroom-tile-accurately-what-youll-need-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bathroom tiling project</a>, it&#8217;s easy to become focused on the cost of the tile itself. After all, tile is at the heart of the project; it’s the main look of all of this. However, crucial (and often overlooked) steps like prep and time for labor can impact how much it&#8217;ll cost you to tile a bathroom. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In this guide, Sweeten outlines three categories that go into the cost to tile a bathroom: <strong>prep</strong>, <strong>materials</strong>, and <strong>labor</strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Tiling prep work</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Before beginning the tile project, a number of items in the bathroom must be removed. After they have been removed, the subfloor must be assessed.</span></p>
<h4>Using ceramic tile in your bathroom?</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ceramic tile requires a stable base (substrate) that is rigid and does not bend. The bathroom’s existing subfloor should either be strong enough or it should be strengthened. For natural stone tile, the industry group <a href="https://www.ceramictilefoundation.org/homeowners-guide-to-hiring-qualified-tile-installer#chapter-3"><span class="s2">Ceramic Tile Education Foundation</span></a> (CTEF) recommends that the substrate be twice as rigid as for tiling with ceramics or porcelains. If the substrate is not smooth enough, it may require an additional layer of underlayment.</span></p>
<h4>Removing bathroom items</h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Toilet: The toilet must always be removed before tiling a floor. The toilet will either be replaced, or a new toilet may be installed.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Baseboards: Wall baseboards and any type of horizontal wall molding that touches the floor must be removed before tiling.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Door casing: Door casing—the vertical trim that forms a door frame—usually doesn&#8217;t need to be removed. Tile workers can cut the bottom of the casing and fit the tile underneath.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Shower/bathtub and bathroom cabinet: Showers, tubs, sink cabinets, and any permanent pieces do not need to be removed. However, sometimes they are removed during a full bathroom remodel.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Preparing (or repairing) the subfloor</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When installing tile in a remodeled bathroom, it is common to find a damaged subfloor. This damage tends to be concentrated around the toilet, sink, and shower/bathtub. If you are removing the shower or bath, you may find even more damage under the shower pan or bathtub.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sometimes, large sections of the subfloor may need to be removed and replaced with a new subfloor. In some cases, the damage may extend to the floor joists (the beams below the subfloor). Both of these fixes are separate from the tiling.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you are working with a general contractor, the contractor will remove all of the necessary items and make repairs. This prep work should be done ahead of time before the tile subcontractor begins.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While removing items is heavily a labor cost, some materials may figure in. This depends on the scale of the project. For example, large projects may require the rental of a dumpster. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Raw materials for prepping</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Though tile is the most visible feature of bathroom tile, a support system of other materials makes a bathroom tile surface possible. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Subfloor prep materials</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Solid subfloor: Exterior-grade, tongue-and-groove plywood is a standard subfloor material.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Underlayment on top of subfloor: Many tile pros recommend laying down an additional layer of thin cement board on top of the subfloor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Leveling compound: Dips in the subfloor can be corrected with a liquid leveling compound. Poured directly onto the subfloor, this compound is self-leveling. It fills gaps up to 1-1/2-inch deep.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Tiling materials</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Thin-set: Thin-set is the mortar base that is applied under the tile.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Grout: Grout is the filler that is applied to the joints between the tiles.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Grout tint: Grout usually comes in a few variations of gray, black, cream, or white. But grout can also be tinted to nearly any color you desire.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Grout sealant: Grout is porous and must be sealed to prevent moisture infiltration.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Haze remover: A light haze remains from the grouting process. A liquid haze remover is needed to clean this up.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Optional materials</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Uncoupling material: When installing tile on concrete, many tile professionals recommend that you use a special material to avoid cracking. An uncoupling material disconnects the tile from the concrete slab. This prevents concrete from transmitting cracks to the tile. <a href="https://www.ceramictilefoundation.org/homeowners-guide-to-hiring-qualified-tile-installer#chapter-3"><span class="s2">CTEF recommends</span></a> that all concrete floors with pre-existing cracks be installed with uncoupling material.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Radiant heating: To combat cold tile floors, many homeowners opt for radiant heating underneath the tile. This electrically operated mesh is embedded in the thin-set mortar. It is controlled by a wall thermostat.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Time and cost of labor</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many types of home projects are DIY-friendly. But tilework is a long-established, highly skilled craft that can be tricky for many DIYers to master. So, hiring pros to expertly lay the tile pays for itself many times over.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If the cost of tiling materials (thin-set, grout, etc.) is not broken out in an estimate, it may be included in the labor cost. If so, it will be noted as such.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One more factor that affects the cost of tile installation labor is the need for the tile contractor to return several times to the job site. After setting the tile, workers must allow at least 24 hours before returning for grouting. After grouting, workers must wait at least another 4 hours before returning to remove the grout haze. </span><span class="s1">All consults and the clean-up are usually included in the installation cost.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Choosing the style and color of your bathroom tile is an exciting remodeling step. But as you now know, there are many other factors that can impact the total cost to tile a bathroom. Knowing those factors will give you a leg up in understanding the bottom-line total cost when discussing the project with your contractor. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>COVID-19 brings opportunities if you want to remodel your home, but you’ll need to know how to navigate</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48721 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4.jpg" alt="Image of a room in the middle of painting" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>When the global pandemic of 2020 hit, few homeowners were thinking about home remodeling. Yet as the pandemic wore on, life returned to (some) idea of normal and home remodeling once again became a topic. It was top of mind for homeowners who had already started a remodel before COVID-19 spread. Homeowners who had only considered remodeling also started to plan their projects in earnest.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to remodeling, COVID-19 has impacted material costs and changed the supply chain. Sweeten outlines what a homeowner might expect to encounter while taking on a remodel during COVID-19, and how to navigate those obstacles to get your renovation plans back on track.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>We&#8217;re noticing our homes in new ways, every day</h3>
<p>Homeowners now spend more time than ever at home. Flaws that were merely annoying with that bathroom or kitchen are now magnified. Homeowners who only wondered if their home was ready for a remodel now know.</p>
<p>This need isn’t just imaginary, either. More people at home means that renovation is a necessity. Even if only a couple of people live there, everything in the house is being used more often.</p>
<h3>Savings from 2020 allow for renovations in 2021</h3>
<p>The pandemic has hit many people hard—the job market, businesses, people’s health. Some homeowners have been lucky, and employers have found ways to keep workers employed from home.</p>
<p>However, there is a rare upside to the COVID-19 pandemic for some Americans. Many homeowners’ expenses have shrunk dramatically. What has contributed to this? With less driving, gas and vehicle expenses drop. Less dining out and entertaining means lighter credit card bills. Vacation plans have been canceled.</p>
<p>This has caught many experts by surprise, too. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies had previously predicted a slowdown in home remodeling in 2021. But as 2020 wore on, the group revised its prediction. They now<a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/home-remodeling-set-stronger-growth-2021"> indicate that home remodeling</a> is going stronger than ever, with a projected uptick in home renovation and repair spending from 2020 to 2021.</p>
<p>Indeed, at Sweeten, we saw an increase in home renovation projects. Our fourth quarter saw 110% growth year-over-year from 2019 to 2020. The trend is continuing into 2021 as well, with 99% growth for January 2021 vs. 2020. We attribute this growth to homeowners realizing their homes need to be so much more than a place to just sleep. More than ever, we&#8217;ve needed our homes to provide us space for work, play, self-care, and recovery.</p>
<h3>Act fast, or prepare to wait for building materials</h3>
<p>Homeowners intent on remodeling may find themselves blocked due to a severe slowdown in the supply of materials. In many sectors, the manufacturing of building materials drastically slowed or came to a complete stop. Even if manufacturers are functioning again, they are doing so at a reduced capacity due to social distancing.</p>
<p>The pandemic shows how much the U.S. depends on overseas building products like lumber, roofing, and windows. For one, many homes’ kitchen and bathroom remodels use ceramic and porcelain tile. However, over<a href="https://www.floorcoveringweekly.com/main/topnews/2019-us-ceramic-tile-market-update-29623"> 81% of U.S. tile</a> comes from China, Mexico, Spain, Italy, and Brazil. Both Spain and Italy were hard hit particularly by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Home centers are ordering up to 300% more product due to the high level of DIY home repairs and remodels. This has a significant impact on the supply chain for builders.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Don&#8217;t wait! For homeowners interested in renovating, it&#8217;s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up.</p>
<h3>Labor lag-time is a reality</h3>
<p>Soon after the pandemic hit, over<a href="https://www.agc.org/sites/default/files/Files/Communications/Recap_Current_Construction_Business_Conditions_Final.pdf"> 25% of building projects</a> came to an immediate halt or were delayed, according to an industry group. For any homeowner thinking of a remodel, this means that all other projects in the queue must come first.</p>
<p>Even materials that are acquired and on-site do no good unless there are workers to install them. Workers who have had to tend to family members affected by COVID-19 have left the workforce or even the U.S. At the same time, other workers who are eager to work have filled in the vacuum.</p>
<h3>Tips on handling your COVID-19 remodel project</h3>
<p>The future is unclear, but one thing is certain: COVID-19’s effects are long-lasting. Even after vaccines are widely dispensed, there will be an effect in building and remodeling. Here&#8217;s what proactive homeowners can do to position themselves well for a remodel during COVID-19 recovery.</p>
<h4>Book a contractor now</h4>
<p>The desire to remodel has increased, and in many markets, demand outstrips supply. If you delay speaking to a contractor, you’ll have<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/16/what-you-can-do-now-plan-manage-home-renovation-once-conditions-are-right/?arc404=true"> even more orders</a> jump into the line ahead of you. With vaccines being widely distributed, there will only be more people booking a contractor. Begin setting up appointments to meet general contractors for site visits.</p>
<h4>Conduct virtual site-visits</h4>
<p>Sweeten offers a streaming video conference on the platform. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-renovate-safely-with-a-virtual-site-visit/">virtual site visit replaces</a> both the general contractor’s walk-through of the property and the face-to-face conference between contractor and homeowner.</p>
<p>If done effectively, it can give the contractor enough information to begin drawing up an estimate. This allows for both parties to safely review the renovation project virtually, without meeting in person.</p>
<p>Take note: a physical site visit will need to be done at some point for the contractor to take their own measurements and account for every detail. Virtual site visits are a good option, however, if an initial in-person site visit isn’t possible or safe.</p>
<h4>Expect higher costs, but shop smartly for savings</h4>
<p>Some<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/always-expect-home-remodeling-to-cost-50-percent-more-take-50-percent-longer-finance-expert.html"> experts predict</a> that home remodeling not only will take longer but will cost up to 50% more than in pre-pandemic times. Don&#8217;t worry: this gives motivated homeowners the chance to shop for items on their own. Make sure to seek the best possible prices out there, and select your contractor carefully.</p>
<h4>Make the most of your space with clever design</h4>
<p>Speaking early on to a general contractor or designer will help you solidify your ideas. Hone your design with care and avoid waste.</p>
<p>The transformation of under-utilized spaces is a trend here to stay. Basements, attics, or garages are performing in new ways. At Sweeten, we&#8217;re seeing attics turn into places for children to learn and play. Basements are mostly getting turned into gyms. Garages are becoming studios or offices that could be rented out in the future.</p>
<p>With multiple family members at home during the day, the installation of glass panels has gained traction. People aren’t looking for visual separation—they need acoustic separation when working from home.</p>
<p>Outdoor spaces and outdoor kitchens will be popular. It’s unknown if we’ll still be social distancing through the summer. Being able to host the whole event outside, not having to run back and forth inside, makes the event a better experience.</p>

<h3>What is aging in place design? What does accessible design mean?</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To some, &#8220;<strong>aging in place&#8221;</strong> is a design term that means creating living spaces that are safe and accessible for people who want to stay in their homes and care for themselves as they grow older. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To others, the term <strong>&#8220;accessible design&#8221;</strong> or &#8220;living in place&#8221; is more applicable, as it means designing spaces that suit the needs of children and adults in one home. In both cases, the goal is to create living spaces that are, safe, accessible, and also make design sense.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> gives an overview of aging in place design costs, plus costs for accessible designs, and gives tips for when these designs can be beneficial to the family lifestyle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much does accessible design cost?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When part of a major renovation, the cost to include accessible techniques can be minor. &#8220;Things don&#8217;t necessarily need to cost more, they are just different,&#8221; said </span><span class="s3">Julie Schuster of <a href="https://www.jlsdesignstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julie Schuster Design Studio</a></span><span class="s1"> and is a certified living in place professional (CLIPP). &#8220;If you are remodeling a kitchen you probably want under cabinet lighting. Why not upgrade slightly to add bright LED lights that are good for aging eyes?&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are two approaches to accessible living spaces: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Remodel to suit the urgent needs of the homeowner. </b> A wheelchair user will need, among other things, wide doorways and hallways, and a curbless shower with a bench and grab bars. A family with young children may want night lights in the hallways, non-slip bathroom floor tiles, and anti-scald shower valves.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Remodel to make the design flexible for future improvements.</b> &#8220;It is important to learn the things that could crop up in the future and then design backward for them. I install blocking behind a shower wall while renovating, so grab bars or a built-in bench can be added later. Putting in the blocking does not add to the overall cost,&#8221; said Kammi Reiss of <a href="https://www.kammireissdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s4">Kammi Reiss Design</span></a>.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4914#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s4">Sweeten contractor Aaro</span>n</a>, being flexible in design is key. In one condo project, they placed a removable panel in front of the kitchen sink so a wheelchair user can roll up to the sink for use. </span></p>
<h3>What does aging in place cost?</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While many accessible design techniques have similar costs as any renovation project,  some projects do have an increased cost. For example, the combination of slippery surfaces and a wet setting in bathrooms often cause accidents, especially for people with mobility issues or poor eyesight. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here&#8217;s a comparison from the <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 Cost vs. Value Report</a> that compares a standard  5-foot by 7-foot bathroom of mid-range quality to an accessible one of the same size. The accessible bathroom includes 36-inch-wide doors, flat panel electric switches installed at sitting level, walk-in curbless shower with fold-out seat, adjustable shower head, thermostatic mixing valve, LED lighting, ceramic tile walls with contrasting color stripes, towel bars (grab bars) that can support 250 pounds each, night lights, and reconfigured storage accessible to someone in a seated position, among other items.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s an example of what universal design can recoup at resale at a national level.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Costs $24,424 recouping 60% at resale</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Standard universal design remodel: Costs $38,813 recouping 58% at resale</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;<i>Remodeling</i> asked us to revise the remodeling project for them,&#8221; said Louie Delaware, co-founder of the <a href="https://www.livinginplace.institute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Living in Place Institute</span></a>. &#8220;Everyone assumed that it would cost much more and would not be worth as much.&#8221;  While there are increased costs, the return on investment is similar to that of the accessible bathroom. </span></p>
<h3>Costs for accessible design projects:</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are some estimated costs for common projects often associated with accessible designs:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Entrance ramp: $1,300 to $ 3,500<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Door widening to accommodate wheelchairs: $400 to $800, each<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Chair lift: $3,000 to $6,000, curved stairs will cost more<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Widening hallways (often includes moving plumbing, heating and cooling and electrical lines):  $500 to $2,000<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Grab bars with decorative finishes: $100 to $200, each<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Curbless showers: $2,000 to $8,000<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Faucets with lever controls: $200 to $400<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many of the techniques used in accessible design or aging in place design are the same, whether planning for yourself, someone who wants to age in place, or to suit the needs of a growing family. The goal is to create a safe, accessible design for everyone to enjoy.</span></p>

Whatever your abode, it’s a great time to renovate in Washington DC, <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/cb16-43.html"><span class="s2">the sixth</span></a> most populated area in the country. </span><span class="s1">If you’re ready to make your own splash to a home <em>and</em> increase its value, one of your first steps is to create a budget to cover your remodeling costs in DC. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a quick overview of budgets for some standard renovation projects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Gut renovation: Starting at <strong>$100</strong> per square foot (psf)<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen remodel: Starting at </span><span class="s3"><strong>$20,000</strong>—<strong>$25,000</strong></span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at </span><span class="s3"><strong>$30,000</strong>—<strong>$40,000</strong></span><strong><span class="s4"> </span></strong><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at </span><strong><span class="s3">$68,000</span></strong><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Budget bathroom remodel: </span><span class="s3">Starting at<strong> $12,000</strong>—<strong>$15,000</strong></span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Starting at </span><strong><span class="s3">$21,000</span></strong> <span class="s5">or <strong>$600</strong> psf.</span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">High-end bathroom remodel and extension: </span><span class="s3">Starting at <strong>$40,000</strong></span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Adding square footage: Starts at <strong>$120</strong> psf<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Total Gut Renovation Costs for a DC Home</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A total gut renovation in Washington DC that brings a home down to its frame and studs could start at around </span><span class="s4"><strong>$100</strong> psf</span><span class="s1">. Doing it all at once will get you the best price per square foot if you are already planning multiple projects. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much does a Washington DC kitchen remodel cost per square foot?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A best-value kitchen remodel typically starts between </span><span class="s3"><strong>$20,000</strong>—<strong>$25,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. This allows the replacement of cabinets and countertops from big-box stores, a stocked appliance package, and tile flooring.<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">For a mid-grade kitchen, expect starting costs between </span><span class="s3"><strong>$30,000</strong>—<strong>$40,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. This pricepoint would include semi-custom cabinets, hardwood floors, upgrade in appliances, and an island (with no sink).<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/washington-dc/"><span class="s2">report</span></a> found the average cost in the Washington DC area costs around <strong>$68,000</strong>. This works out to be <strong>$340</strong> psf. About 60 percent of the cost is recouped in the value it adds to your home. With a budget of this amount, you can remodel a 200-square-foot space with countertops, semi-custom wood cabinets, and a stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet. It also allows the addition of a built-in microwave, dishwasher, and custom lighting. Other than<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/"><span class="s2"> adding a kitchen island</span></a>, the layout, such as where the oven and dishwasher are installed, must remain the same as the original design. Keeping your layout will be the biggest influence in a low budget down.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">For a high-end kitchen remodel, costs start at </span><strong><span class="s3">$68,000</span></strong><span class="s1"> and include a stone or marble countertop as well as opening up the space or removing a wall.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A luxury remodel comes in at an average of <strong>$135,000</strong> for Washington DC, the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/washington-dc/"><span class="s2">report</span></a> found. The psf cost is <strong>$675</strong>. This project can add 58 percent of the budget to your home’s value. A high-end kitchen remodel can consist of custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported ceramic or glass tile backsplashes. The appliances would also kick up a few notches to include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood. The kitchen can also have designer faucets and a water filtration system.</span></p>

<h3></h3>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much does a DC bathroom remodel cost per square foot?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">For a best-value bathroom, expect a typical project to start between </span><span class="s3"><strong>$12,000</strong>—<strong>$15,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. At this budget, it would not be a gut but a refresh.<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A mid-grade bathroom remodel has costs at </span><strong><span class="s3">$21,000</span></strong><span class="s1"> or <strong>$600</strong> psf. These figures come from the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/new-england/boston-ma/"><span class="s2">report</span></a>. For this price,  you can remodel a 35-square-foot bathroom. It includes adding a porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. This renovation can add <strong>$14,000</strong> to a home’s value. That’s 65 percent of the project’s cost.<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A high-end bathroom remodel starts at </span><strong><span class="s3">$40,000</span></strong><span class="s1">. This budget includes a 3 or 4-piece bath such as the sink, shower/tub combination, and toilet. For <strong>$67,000</strong>, a 5-piece bathroom could be installed.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the 2020 Cost Vs Value report, the average price in this category is around <strong>$67,000</strong>. For this price, you can expand your bathroom from 35 square feet to 100 square feet. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/remodeling-a-bathroom-six-trends-to-consider-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new bathroom</a> can have features like a freestanding soaker tub. On top of that, you can have a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. Your budget can also afford a double sink and double-mirror vanity with custom draws and wall cabinets.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding square footage to your DC home </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enlarging living space to an existing floor plan starts at <strong>$120</strong> psf and can easily go up to <strong>$20</strong>0 psf. The most economical addition is adding square footage over a crawl space. An extension where you are adding or adjusting the foundations will come in around <strong>$150</strong> psf. The cost increases to <strong>$200</strong> psf if a wet space—bathroom, laundry, or kitchen—is added. </span><span class="s1">The cost of adding a second floor can start at <strong>$150</strong> psf.  </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Remodeling costs in DC: Permits</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The District of Columbia is a compact city of only 69 square miles. The Council of the District of Columbia issues building permits for this area. Permits cost two percent of the budget for work over <strong>$1,000</strong>. For example, a permit for <strong>$20,000</strong> bathroom will cost <strong>$400</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Prince George’s County, to the east and south of the city, uses an equation for <a href="https://princegeorgescountymd.gov/DocumentCenter/View/23559/DPIE-Fee-Schedule-PDF?bidId="><span class="s2">permit fees</span></a>. <strong>$50</strong> + (Construction Costs x 0.008) = permit fee. So, a <strong>$20,000</strong> renovation would cost <strong>$210</strong>. Watch out for specific fees for projects such as basement finishing which is <strong>$340</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Montgomery County, the area to the north,<a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/DPS/Resources/Files/IT/AllFees.pdf"><span class="s2"> building permits</span></a> for alterations, additions, and repairs start at <strong>$270</strong>.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Westchester home remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s no secret that Westchester County, with its close proximity to New York City, is one of the pricier areas when it comes to real estate. That is also reflected in the cost of renovations. <span style="color: #333333;">On average, many Sweeten projects can range from <strong>$100 </strong></span><strong>psf<span style="color: #333333;">—$250 </span>psf</strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333333;">. Based in Westchester, </span></span></span><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4186" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Gregory</span></a> has worked on projects that involve multiple rooms or a gut renovation at the <strong>$250 psf range. </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anything higher, he said, “usually applies to one or more specialty trades, such as architects or engineers, and insurance costs which factors into the overall budget.” Choice of material will also affect the cost per square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Similarly, a higher cost stems from the quality and experience of the skilled workers the contractors hire for the project. “Costs for construction vary based on experience, which increases for a higher-end result,” said a <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor,</span> who handles projects in the Westchester area. For instance, “A presentation representing the finished product—design and organizing, scheduling, and advising on the materials—is a service that adds to the budget.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing to note: While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. Therefore, the prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much a Westchester kitchen renovation costs</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="s2">Budget kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at </span><span class="s3"><b>$25,000—$30,000</b></span><span class="s2"> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.</span></li>
<li><span class="s2">Mid-grade kitchen: Expect to see starting budgets from </span><span class="s3"><strong>$40,000</strong>—<strong>$50,000</strong></span><span class="s2"> for a typical mid-grade kitchen.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s2">Westchester-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a> has worked on projects costing <b>$40,000</b> for 150 square feet, or about<b> $260 psf</b>. This budget includes mid-grade finishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s2"><i>Remodeling</i>’s<a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span class="s5">Cost vs. Value report</span></a> puts <b>$350 psf</b> or <b>$70,000</b> total, as an average for Westchester County. These figures are based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with standard finishes, like an energy-efficient range, built-in microwave, and ventilation system. It also includes garbage disposal, custom lighting, and resilient floorings such as vinyl, linoleum, or cork.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">High-end kitchen: Sweeten has seen projects start at <strong>$70,000</strong> for a high-end kitchen.<span class="s2"><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><span class="s6">In the Cost vs. Value report, the average high-end kitchen remodel cost <b>more than $137,000</b> for a 200-square foot space. </span><span class="s7">A project in that price range includes custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported tile backsplashes. The appliances can include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood as well as high-end faucets and a water filtration system.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">According to Sweeten contractor Majid, a large part of a high-end kitchen can be attributed to the cabinets. For example, one of Majid&#8217;s clients recently spent <b>$50,000</b> on fully custom European cabinets.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much a Westchester bathroom renovation costs</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="s2">Budget bathroom: A budget bathroom renovation, including demo, plumbing work, and new finishes, can reach </span><span class="s3"><b>$16,000</b></span><span class="s2">, said Oziel. Bathrooms in this category typically lean on big-box stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot to source the majority of materials.<br /></span></li>
<li><span class="s2">Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom in Westchester County will cost on average </span><span class="s3"><b>$22,000</b>,</span><span class="s2"> according to the Cost vs. Value report, which is <b>$628 psf</b> for a 35-square-foot bathroom. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain-on-steel tub.<br /></span></li>
<li><span class="s2">High-end bathroom: Prices can start at around <strong>$32,000</strong> for a standard full bath with high-end finishes. However, homeowners are more likely to splurge for high-end in their master baths, bringing the starting cost for a typical high-end bathroom to around <strong>$46,000.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With a higher budget, clients are looking at faucets that can cost $2,000 apiece, marble flooring, custom vanities, built-in medicine cabinets, a rain shower, and top-of-the-line lighting fixtures. At times, those pricey finishing materials can amount to half the budget. Whether it is budget or high-end, good general contractors can strategize with a reasonable budget to help clients achieve renovation goals.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for a basement renovation in Westchester</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractors have worked on basement renovations that cost anywhere from <b>$20,000 to $75,000. </b>A<b> $20,000—$30,000 </b>or <b>$50/psf </b>budget would update an already finished basement. This includes painting, flooring, and lighting. If the space is raw and being <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovated to a finished living area</a>, the cost is around <b>$75,000</b>. For this budget, a bathroom, a kitchen, and HVAC can be added.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Majid, a simple basement remodel can cost as little as <b>$50 a square foot</b>, which works out to be about <b>$40,000</b> for an 800-square-foot space. Adding a toilet or shower could increase your budget, plus any necessary work to bring the room up to code. Waterproofing and drainage can also push up a basement project’s cost. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some town regulations might require two forms of egress or natural light (by adding a door or a window) or a certain ceiling height, which means digging down and lowering the floor. An average basement conversion in Westchester is <b>$75,000</b>, according to the Cost vs. Value report. A project with this budget includes a 20×30 foot room, a 5&#8217;×8&#8242; bathroom with a shower and bar area, plus insulation and laminate flooring. This example project works out to<b> $117 psf</b>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for permits in Westchester</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cost of permits changes from town to town in Westchester County. Typically, home renovation costs will be determined by your budget, and require some basic math to figure out. For example, the permit costs below are broken out among the different towns across the County:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Pelham</span></span><span class="s1">: Building permits cost <b>$250</b> for a project costing under <b>$5,000</b> plus <b>$12</b> per each additional <b>$1,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Scarsdale</span></span><span class="s1">: Building permits cost<b> $255</b> for a project costing between <b>$10,000</b> and <b>$50,000</b>. For projects budgeted over <b>$100,000</b>, a permit costs a flat fee of <b>$1,755</b> plus <b>$14</b> for each <b>$1,000</b> or fraction over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Katonah</span></span><span class="s1">: Permits cost <b>$14</b> for every <b>$1,000</b> of a budgeted project.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Hastings-on-Hudson</span></span><span class="s1">: The fee will cost <b>$17</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of the estimated construction cost.<br /></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dallas is the ninth-largest city in the United States. It’s a headquarter for multiple Fortune 500 companies like American Airlines. There’s the Dallas Cowboys as well as real cowboys. And of course, there’s BBQ. Dallas is a thriving city and a great place to renovate your dream home.<span> </span></span><span class="s2"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>‘s guide to home remodeling costs in Dallas</span><span><span class="s3"> provides a jumping-off point to get you on your way. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Developing a budget is your first step to your dream home. Sweeten contractors will want to sit down with you and inspect your home to reach an accurate number. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a quick overview of budgets for some typical renovation projects:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Gut renovation: starting at<span> </span><strong>$80 – $100</strong><span> </span>per square foot (psf)<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Low-end kitchen remodel: starting at<span> </span><strong>$10,000 – $15,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-range kitchen remodel: starting at<span> </span><strong>$25,000 – $30,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen remodel: starting at<span> </span><strong>$40,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Low-end bathroom remodel: starting at<span> </span><strong>$8,000 – $15,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-range bathroom remodel: starting at<span> </span><strong>$15,000 – $25,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end bathroom remodel and expansion: starting at<span> </span><strong>$30,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Deck composite:<span> </span><strong>$19,000</strong><span> </span>or<span> </span><strong>$60</strong><span> </span>psf<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Wood deck:<span> </span><strong>$13,000</strong><span> </span>or<span> </span><strong>$40</strong><span> </span>psf<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">2020 Dallas remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2020, a total gut renovation in Dallas that brings your home down to its bare bones and remodels it to your liking, starts at<span> </span><strong>$80 – $100</strong><span> </span>psf for a home that has low-range finishes. This means materials such as laminate flooring and countertops, value-brand appliances, and basic tiles from big box stores like Home Depot. Both<span> </span>Sweeten contractor Joel<span> </span>and<span> </span>Sweeten contractor Kyle, both based in Dallas, </span><span class="s1">have worked on renovations that came under this budget range. These scenarios, however, are dependant on the scope of work and existing conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although a gut renovation is a big project, consider doing it all at once to get you the best bang for your buck. You’ll also have your dream home much quicker than renovating room by room. </span></p>
<p><span>As a guide, Joel advises clients to tie the price of your kitchen (or bathroom) renovation to the price of your home. You should only spend between 10 and 20 percent of the value “to really cap the budget at the return on investment,” Joel said. So for a <strong>$300,000</strong> home, aim to spend between <strong>$30,000</strong> and <strong>$60,000</strong> on a bathroom or kitchen remodel, which will be a major slice of a gut renovation project. </span></p>
<p><span>Before getting started, Kyle suggests homeowners should research other recent remodels in the area to see what materials and appliances were used. This is important if you want to resell quickly so you don’t end up with a low-end renovation in a high-end area or vice versus. If this is your forever home, then your personal taste is more important than whoever you might sell to years later.  </span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a Dallas kitchen remodel costs per square foot in 2020</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s5">A Dallas kitchen renovation i<span>n the best-value range can start at <strong>$10,000</strong> and reach <strong>$15,000</strong>. A kitchen renovation in the best-value range can start at <strong>$15,000</strong>, according to Kyle. To get a new kitchen at this price, it needs to be a rip-and-replace job, meaning a layout of the kitchen must stay the same with pipes and appliances remaining where they are. Cabinets are the highest ticket item in a kitchen budget, said Joel. To keep costs down cabinets can be re-stained or re-painted. The next step up is pre-fab followed by semi-custom. Fully custom costs the most, he said.</span><br /></span><span class="s5"><br /></span></li>
<li class="li5"><span><span class="s5">A mid-range kitchen remodel in Dallas has costs starting at <strong>$25,000 – $30,000</strong>. What does a mid-range kitchen look like at this starting cost? T<span class="s1">he kitchen layout must remain the same as a rip-and-replace: swap your old oven for your new one and your old sink for your new sink. </span></span><span class="s1">You can get a stainless steel sink with single-lever faucet, laminate countertops, a built-in microwave, new appliances, custom lighting, and semi-custom cabinets. An island could also be added. Moving plumbing, gas, and electrical, reconfiguring the layout, or choosing custom features will increase the budget.</span></span></li>
<li class="li5"><span>For an upscale kitchen, labor costs and a refresh with select high-end materials such as marble or quartz countertops, imported backsplash tile, and high-quality fixtures start at <strong>$40,000</strong>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The upscale kitchens Kyle has worked on were budgeted from <strong>$50,000</strong> and up. A big chunk of those budgets were for custom-made cabinets, as well as quartz countertops and expensive backsplashes. “Adding French doors or moving walls to create a larger kitchen…” also brings up the price, Kyle said. As will above and below cabinet lighting, moving plumbing, and custom-built islands, he said.</span></p>
<p><span>There are plenty of variables in most materials, Joel said. For example, with quartz, you can spend <strong>$2,000</strong> or <strong>$7,000</strong> depending upon the quality. “It just comes down to not overbuilding for your house,” Sweeten contractor Joel advised.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a Dallas bathroom remodel costs per square foot in 2020</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">At the low-end, expect a rip-and-replace bathroom with no behind-the-wall surprises to start at<span> </span><strong>$8,000 – $15,000</strong>.</span> These are typically smaller master baths or guest bathrooms. The layout will remain the same where plumbing doesn’t move, Kyle said. This budget won’t include any issues like leaks or mold discovered once the project begins. Materials will include a prefabricated vanity, ceramic tile, and fixtures from big-box stores.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">In the Dallas area, a mid-range bathroom can start at<span> </span><strong>$15,000 – $25,000</strong>. The average cost for this price range remodel is about<span> </span><strong>$20,000</strong><span> </span>or<span> </span><strong>$570</strong><span> </span>psf, as per<span> </span><em>Remodeling</em>‘s Cost Vs Value<span> </span><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/west-south-central/dallas-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>. The key to a budget in this range is rip-and-replace. This means keeping the layout the same and swapping out an old toilet for a new one, an old vanity for a new one, etc. That way, no expensive plumbing work is needed.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The example project for this budget is a 35-square-foot bathroom. You can install a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. More<span> </span></span>than<span> </span><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/west-south-central/dallas-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">55 percent of your budget</a><span> </span><span class="s1"><span>can be recouped in the value the project adds to your home.  </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">
<p class="p1"><span><span class="s1">For a high-end bathroom remodel and expansion, the cost can start at <strong>$30,000</strong>. </span><span class="s2">This budget includes a three-piece bathroom (tub/shower combo, toilet, and sink) for a typical 5’ x 7’ space. The cost increases with features including a double vanity, creating a separate shower from the tub, specialty tile, a custom vanity, or a toilet with additional functions.</span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Cost drivers are things like removing an existing tub or shower to install a new standalone tub,” said Sweeten contractor Kyle. It can also include building larger showers, moving walls to expand bathroom size, custom vanities, and frameless glass shower enclosure.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">2020 costs for outdoors &amp; deck remodeling in Dallas </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dallas is a city perfect for outdoor entertaining, whether it’s a crisp winter night in front of the fire pit or a cold beer paired with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/how-to-prepare-your-home-for-extreme-heat-in-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hot summer evening</a>. An outdoor area is often the cherry on top of a dream home remodel. It’s the project to really let your creative juices flow. There are endless options to make your outdoor area your own with extensive outdoor kitchens, gas fireplaces, fans and misting systems for cooling, custom lighting, and landscaping. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A basic wooden deck will likely cost<span> </span><strong>$40</strong><span> </span>psf or<span> </span><strong>$13,000</strong><span> </span>for something in the 320 square foot range, according to the Cost Vs Value<span> </span><span class="s6">report</span>. A deck made from composite, a mix of wood product and plastic, will cost just under<span> </span><strong>$19,000</strong><span> </span>for the same size or<span> </span><strong>$60</strong><span> </span>psf. This material tends to last longer and requires less maintenance. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">2020 Remodeling costs in Dallas: Permits</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dallas is experiencing a lot of new building construction. This has resulted in a more rigorous approval process compared to approvals for existing homes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are numerous cities and towns that make up Dallas. Each one has its own building department and its own fee structure for permits. Your Sweeten contractor will likely put an estimate in the budget for building permits, which will be determined by your end costs or square footage of your project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The upmarket suburb of Highland Park bases building permit costs on square footage. The permit for a 200 square foot kitchen renovation costs<span> </span><strong>$490</strong>, according to Highland Park’s calculator.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the city of Addison,<a href="https://addisontexas.net/sites/default/files/fileattachments/development_services/page/10881/fee_schedule_for_bldg_permits.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s6"><span> </span>building permit fees</span></a><span> </span>start at<span> </span><strong>$40</strong><span> </span>for projects under<span> </span><strong>$500</strong><span> </span>in value. Fees then increase with the project’s budget. For example, a project with a budget between<span> </span><strong>$2,000</strong><span> </span>and<span> </span><strong>$25,000</strong><span> </span>will have a base cost of<span> </span><strong>$115</strong><span> </span>with an additional<span> </span><strong>$23</strong><span> </span>per<span> </span><strong>$1,000</strong><span> </span>for estimated costs over<span> </span><strong>$2,000</strong>. That means the permit for a<span> </span><strong>$20,000</strong><span> </span>mid-range bathroom remodel will cost<span> </span><strong>$529</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building permit fees in<span> </span><span class="s6">Cedar Hill</span>, southwest of the city’s center, are determined by square footage. There is a set fee of<span> </span><strong>$400</strong><span> </span>for any renovation of less than 1,250 square feet. For each additional square foot over 1,250, the permit increases by<span> </span><strong>$.60</strong>. After 2,500 square feet, it increases by<span> </span><strong>$.40</strong>.</span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639486965282"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does it cost to remodel a house in Dallas?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">If you’re planning a gut renovation (taking a home down to the studs and building it back up,) and are using budget-level finishes, expect to pay $80-100 psf in Dallas, Texas. A good rule of thumb for Dallas homeowners is to limit spending on a renovation project to 10-20% of your total home value. This helps control the budget while ensuring you’ll get maximum resale value for the renovation itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639486987456"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does a kitchen remodel cost in Dallas?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Budget-conscious Dallas homeowners should budget $15,000 and more for a simple kitchen remodel. A higher, mid-range Dallas kitchen remodel will start in the range of $25,000-$30,000; but requires a rip-and-replace (no layout changes!) Higher-end kitchen remodels in Dallas will cost $50,000 and up; for layout changes, custom work, and premium materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639487009938"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does it cost to remodel a bathroom in Dallas?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A simple rip-and-replace Dallas bathroom remodel will cost between $8,000 – $15,000, for a small master or guest bathroom. Mid-range bathrooms see costs increase to the $15,000-$25,000 range. Premium bathroom remodels in Dallas start around $30,000, but costs increase if you’re swapping showers or tubs out, discover hidden issues, or get specialty tilework.</p>

<p>Creating a budget for a renovation is unique to every project; the many variables, from your own taste for materials and quality of work to whether you are changing the layout or are moving plumbing or gas lines in a kitchen or bathroom, all factor into the equation.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, has compiled a general guide to renovation costs in Fairfield County focusing on four categories—kitchen, bathroom, basement, and permits.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of typical starting costs compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full home renovation: <strong>$150—$350</strong> per square foot (psf)</li>
<li>Budget kitchen remodel: <strong>$25,000</strong></li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: <strong>$335 </strong>psf or <strong>$67,000</strong></li>

<h2>What a Connecticut home remodel cost per square foot</h2>
<p>The general range for a gut renovation in Fairfield County, CT is <strong>$150</strong> to <strong>$250 psf</strong>, according to Elizabeth, an architect in the Sweeten network. That price can easily sneak up to <strong>$300</strong> to <strong>$350</strong> a square foot, she advised, depending on how complex your renovation is (structural issues, layout changes, etc.) and how expensive your tastes are in terms of fixtures and finishes. Those figures also do not include fees for architects and engineers who might be necessary throughout the course of the project.</p>
<p>Residential renovation costs have increased on average <a href="https://edzarenski.com/2018/11/16/2019-construction-economic-forecast-dec-2018e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5.7% each year</a> between 2013 and 2018. For most contractors, cost increases or decreases in all areas—labor, materials, etc—can fluctuate year to year and even throughout the year. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Oziel</a>, who works in Westchester as well as Fairfield, also pointed out that finishes—tiles, flooring, countertops, lighting, appliances, faucets, etc.—go up each year, as do overhead costs for workers compensation and general liability insurance.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry, a Sweeten contractor</a> in Fairfield County, said he tries to absorb the increases in insurance costs. He also said that while construction items go up every year, most of the increase goes to framing and electrical materials. Sweeten architect Elizabeth noted that a shrinking construction labor force in wealthy areas raises the price for skilled plumbers, electricians, and framers.</p>
<h2>Costs for a Connecticut kitchen renovation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Budget kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.  <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a> has done a budget kitchen for <strong>$40,000</strong> that was 150 square feet. This budget includes semi-custom cabinets and granite or quartz countertops with no changes to the layout.</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen: A typical mid-grade kitchen renovation in Fairfield County is priced at <strong>$335 psf</strong>, or <strong>$67,000</strong> according to the Cost vs. Value report. These figures are based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with laminate countertops, a standard sink, and faucet, with an energy-efficient range, built-in microwave, and ventilation system. It also includes a garbage disposal, custom lighting and resilient floorings such as vinyl, linoleum, or cork. New kitchens that Elizabeth’s architectural firm has worked on usually cost between<strong> $25,000</strong> to <strong>$60,000</strong>, but it is easy to surpass that, she said.</li>
<li>High-end kitchen: For a kitchen renovation, this could mean fully custom cabinets, sourcing the best materials from overseas, and dealing with the added expense of a layout change, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alfonso, a Sweeten contractor</a>. A recent kitchen renovation he worked on came to <strong>$125,000</strong>. The cabinets alone were <strong>$70,000</strong>, the countertop material was shipped in from Italy, and changing the layout of the kitchen also bumped up the cost and involved substantial plumbing and electrical work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The example Alfonso used came in a little under the Cost vs Value report’s average price of a high-end kitchen of <strong>$133,000</strong> or <strong>$630 psf</strong>. This includes more expensive materials such as stone countertops, an imported tile backsplash, a water filtration system, commercial-grade cooktop, and vent hood, plus a built-in microwave unit.</p>
<h2>Costs for a Connecticut bathroom renovation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Budget bathroom: Sweeten bathroom remodels can start at<strong> $15,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong> for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot. Majid has worked on projects costing <strong>$15,000</strong> for a minimum space measuring 5’ x 8’ that includes labor and rough materials. A budget of <strong>$15,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong> is typical for a full bathroom renovation in the Fairfield area, according to Elizabeth.</li>
<li>Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom in Fairfield County, Connecticut will cost on average <strong>$21,000</strong>, according to the Cost vs Value report which equates to <strong>$600 psf</strong> for a 35-square-foot bathroom. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity country, and a porcelain-on-steel tub.</li>
<li>High-end bathroom: That same report put a high-end bathroom renovation and expansion at<strong> $66,500</strong>. The sample bathroom was expanded from 35 square feet to 100. It amounted to <strong>$665 psf</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the more expensive bathrooms Alfonso worked on came in at <strong>$88,000</strong>. This included a walk-in closet that led into the bathroom. The client wanted a custom-made European toilet, major structural changes, and marble shipped from Italy, which had a lead time of three months for delivery.</p>
<h2>Costs for a Connecticut basement renovation</h2>
<p>Basement renovations by Sweeten contractors have ranged from <strong>$30,000</strong> to<strong> $100,000</strong>. An average basement conversion across the county is <strong>$75,000</strong>, according to the Cost vs Value report. The project for this size budget includes a 20′ x 30′ room and a 5′ x 8′ bathroom with a shower and a bar area as well as insulation and laminate flooring, which comes to <strong>$117 psf</strong>.</p>
<p>The elements that tend to inflate the budget include adding a toilet or a shower and work needed to bring the room up to code. Some town regulations might require two forms of egress or natural light (so adding a door or a window) or a certain ceiling height, which means digging down and lowering the floor.</p>
<h2>Costs for permits</h2>
<p>Each town in Fairfield County has its own table of fees for building permits. Building permits, including those for plumbing and electrical, can cost anywhere from <strong>$300</strong> to <strong>$2,500</strong> per project. The variation is often tied to your budget. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Stamford, your building permit will be<strong> $13.26</strong> for each $1,000 in your budget. That permit will cover your electrical, plumbing, and HVAC work.</li>
<li>In Westport, the permit fee for demolition is <strong>$2</strong> per 100 cubic feet of volume while the building fee is <strong>$10</strong> for each <strong>$1,000</strong> of the renovation budget.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://www.greenwichct.gov/DocumentCenter/View/8484/FEES-2018-PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greenwich</a>, a building permit will be<strong> $13.26</strong> for each <strong>$1,000</strong> in your budget. The electrical permit fee is <strong>$12</strong> per <strong>$1,00</strong>0 of the cost of the project; this fee is the same for a plumbing permit fees.</li>
<li>Over in <a href="https://www.norwalkct.org/128/Fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norwalk</a>, building fees are structured slightly different. A building permit costs <strong>$13</strong> per <strong>$1,000</strong> of estimated work, which includes some electrical, plumbing, and HVAC work. However, if there are major changes in these areas, then separate permits for electrical, plumbing, and HVAC might be required at a cost of <strong>$13.26</strong> for every<strong> $1,000</strong> budgeted in those areas. Check the building department in your local township for a better idea of permitting costs for your project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Issues you may or may not encounter along the way such as structural problems that need fixing or bringing a staircase up to current code could also manipulate your end budget. Take into consideration wet areas like kitchens or bathrooms cost more to renovate than dry spaces (for example, dining rooms and bedrooms) due to materials and labor that may be more complex, Alfonso says.</p>
<p>Hopefully, all of these facts and figures give you a jumping-off point to begin pulling together a budget.

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03-600x400.jpg" alt="conference office table" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone wp-image-45503" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>(Above) A <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/an-nyc-office-renovation-to-expand-working-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new commercial office remodel with Sweeten</a> for an NYC-based tech brand</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps you have outgrown your home office or coworking space or maybe your business is in need of a fresh location or configuration. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office renovation</a> will give you a chance to dream long-term about where your business is heading and interpret that direction into blueprints for a space that will facilitate growth. In this guide, we&#8217;ll consider the many pieces of your office renovation cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An office renovation can be as simple as an improvement project that is negotiated between the landlord and the tenant before signing a lease. Often these are very basic renovations such as fresh paint and some new walls that the tenant ultimately pays for in the cost of the lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are after something more custom, there are, of course, many variables that will determine the cost per square foot. Is the location a new or old building? Was it previously an office? What part of the country will your office be in? What are your business needs? And what quality of work will match those needs?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new building with a basic build-out of carpet, paint, and lighting, including equipment such as a photocopier and coffee machine costs about $40 a square foot, according to <a href="https://42floors.com/us/nv/las-vegas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42Floors</a>, a national search engine listing real estate for office space. On the higher end of the scale, a build-out with finishes such as wood veneer doors and a stone reception desk could hit $100 to $150 a square foot. The office renovation cost could also increase if you are renovating in an older building where quirky spaces and issues, such as slanted floors, must be taken into account. Whatever your tastes and needs, here are budget line items to consider.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs to hire an architect for an office renovation </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people will choose to hire an architect or designer. Expect that to take 20 percent of your renovation budget, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Carla</a>. That could mean $40,000 of a $200,000 budget. Bringing in a design professional early on may save heartaches in the long run. Along with the overall look and feel of the project, architects can also take care of code issues, assess if the workspace size will be comfortable for the number of employees, ensure handicap accessibility, design custom work areas, and more. “You can express creativity and individuality,” said Carla.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office lighting and electrical costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While planning an office remodel, first consider who will be coming to your office, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3218">Anthony, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. If clients are making regular visits, “you don’t want it to look like you’re working out of a bomb shelter,” he said. Decent lighting is one of those elements you can use to impress your clients, an impression that will hopefully lead to more business. Basic lighting can cost about $250 a point (a light with a switch is considered two points), according to Anthony. For each 110 volt outlet, put $150 in your budget, and don’t forget things like lighting for emergency exit signs, which are about $300 each, according to the website <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Move Your Office</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for millwork and finishes in an office</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is another area where you can keep costs down while still wowing potential clients with your new office space. “I’ve done work in lawyer&#8217;s offices where inside it is a vanilla box with cubicles that the clients never see,” said Anthony. “Then you have a lobby and conference room that is decked out with custom woodwork and imported marble.” One sample office budget at Buildings.com put the cost of millwork and finishes at about $25 a square foot. The total office renovation cost for that build-out came to $90 a square foot.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWIyD5_VuQ8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40888 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-UnionSq-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs to build walls</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similar to lighting and millwork, walls can differ greatly in cost. A basic partition wall that is ten linear square feet could cost around $60. Glass walls are not often priced per square foot and are instead sold as a package. However, using executive design elements such as glass walls could push the entire cost of your office renovation towards the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/64oqcghu49v4txd/Kirksey_ConstructionCostUpdate_2015_0.pdf?dl=0%20Paint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$150 </a>a square foot range.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office flooring costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commercial-grade carpet or a vinyl tile can cost <a href="https://naiglobal.com//journal_item_attachments/000/551/662/original/construction_costs.pdf?1421682262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as little</a> as $4 a square foot to supply and install. Wood plank floors can <a href="https://www.remodelingexpense.com/costs/cost-of-plank-flooring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost</a> around $7 a square foot for a 5,000-square-foot office. If there will be an industrial theme in your new office, then concrete flooring might be an economical option starting at $2 a square foot, according to the <a href="https://www.concretenetwork.com/concrete/interiorfloors/cost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concrete Network</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office bathroom costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many office buildings will have a communal bathroom area on each floor for tenants. If there is no bathroom, you must install at least one. <a href="https://americanrestroom.org/the-united-states-code-of-federal-regulations-for-toilet-facilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US code</a> requires one bathroom per one to 15 staff members. That climbs to six bathrooms for 111 to 150 staff.  A single restroom could cost a little under $15,000, according to <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Move Your Office</a>. If your staff likes to shower at work after jogging or riding into the office, a shower (make sure it is handicap friendly as per the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>), will cost just shy of $6,000.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace14-600x388.jpg" alt="" width="725" height="468" class="alignnone wp-image-30090" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace14-600x388.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace14-300x194.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace14.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /><em>(Above) The office kitchen and go-to snacking area from <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/dominos-new-office-is-so-domino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domino&#8217;s NYC office renovation with Sweeten</a></em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office kitchen costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An office kitchen can help team members feel appreciated. In the office renovation cost outline at the end of this article, Sweeten contractor Anthony installed an office bathroom and kitchenette. The total budget for those two items was around $16,000. The kitchenette, which consisted of a sink and fridge, took about 25 percent or $4,000 of that budget. Because the kitchenette and the bathroom were near each other, the project made double use of the plumbing to reduce overall costs. “It really depends on how much plumbing and millwork you need,” said Anthony. “You could have a simple cabinet or a whole countertop with a microwave, fridge, and sink.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fire protection</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on the building you are leasing, this could (hopefully) already be in place. If there is a sprinkler system, it is well worth spending a few hundred dollars to have an engineer inspect it to ensure it works and that it is up to current code. Installing a system from scratch in a small to a medium-sized office could set you back between $5,000 to $10,000, according to Anthony. He estimates that a sprinkler system will cost about $200 per sprinkler head, plus an additional $2,000 to have a plan drawn up as well as permits and inspections.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HVAC for offices</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping an office well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature can have a big impact on employee productivity. So, installing an HVAC—heating ventilation and air conditioning system—might be worth it if there isn’t already one in your new location. An HVAC system could cost between $15 to almost $30 a square foot or 15 to 20 percent of your entire office renovation cost, according to the Builder’s Association.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Labor costs for an office remodel </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a typical office renovation, labor should take about <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ten percent</a> of your entire budget. However, consider the geographic differences in labor costs. For example, the cost of labor in New York City is 70 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/costs/kitchen-remodeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr</a>. Philadelphia is 40 percent and Dallas ten percent above the national average. Charleston, South Carolina, and Scottsdale, Arizona, are both one percent below the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certain factors in individual cities can add another variable. For example, in New York City, there are union and non-union buildings. For union buildings, tenants are required to use union labor, which can almost double the office renovation cost of a project, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. The basic build-out of an office in a non-labor building can be as little as $40 a square foot or as much as $100 a square foot in a labor building, according to <a href="https://42floors.com/edu/space-buildout/gauging-the-cost-of-an-office-build-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42Floors</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, a real budget for a 5,500 square-foot office renovation in NYC from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Paul</a>:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The importance of curb appeal renovations? Homeowners can add value <em>and</em> make an impression, with basic landscaping to prepping the roof.</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33007 size-chrono" title="exterior-large-brown-white-house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-723x406.jpg" alt="exterior of large brown and white house with sloping roof" width="723" height="406" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-723x406.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-300x168.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-600x337.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Landscape/curb appeal project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten landscape designer Michelle</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners who put their house on the market want it to be shown in the best light, and nowhere is this more important than with its exterior. Curb appeal provides the critical first impression to prospective buyers, creating the desire to step inside and see more—or to keep on driving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another advantage to strong curb appeal is that it makes for a pretty picture. Most house hunters start the process by looking at homes online and the first photo from the street can help draw buyers in and entice them to reach out to their realtor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deciding to improve the home&#8217;s exterior at resale is really a balancing act. Perhaps the first question to ask is: why do anything? It&#8217;s a valid question in a hot seller&#8217;s market where houses go on sale on Monday and are in contract by the next weekend. But an improvement can also keep negative impressions out of a buyer&#8217;s mind. Few people are wowed by a nice roof, but everyone can notice missing shingles, discoloration, and other signs of disrepair. Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, outlines the best areas for sellers to focus on for the best return on their budget.</p>
<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Consider the home buyer&#8217;s POV</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Curb appeal involves many different elements, from a well-manicured lawn to an eye-popping entryway to a new roof or siding. Deciding which projects to tackle comes down to what needs to be renovated or at least improved—if something is worn or damaged, it should be replaced or fixed—and based on the budget, what the improvement can add to the resale value of the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Check around the neighborhood to see what is most prevalent with other homes,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a>. &#8220;You want your home to fit in with the culture of the surrounding area. For example, you don&#8217;t want to install vinyl siding in a neighborhood with homes that are predominantly stucco or brick because people who are searching that particular neighborhood are looking for that specific look.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33009 size-chrono" title="brownstone" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front-723x542.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="542" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Landscaping project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten landscape designer Brook</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another obstacle is how homeowners perceive their home. Someone who has lived in the house happily for a number of years may not be aware of its flaws. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to get an opinion from someone else,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle, a contractor with Sweeten</a>. &#8220;Some of my clients call me and say they are looking to sell their house and wonder what they should do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with a qualified general contractor not only gives you the benefit of their expertise, but they can refer you to tradespeople they have worked with and trust—a valuable resource when trying to find a good contractor.</p>
<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Don&#8217;t overlook l</strong><strong>andscaping</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Improving the look of the landscape may be the easiest and least expensive way to enhance curb appeal. &#8220;The landscaping and its health are very important as a well-manicured lot will naturally draw attention to the home. It contributes to the overall look and feel of the place,&#8221; said Majid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Start by making sure the lawn is neatly trimmed and the planting beds have a fresh layer of mulch. Add color and texture by placing seasonal plants in pots around the entry. Ringing trees with mulch will give a kempt look to the yard. While this may sound simple, such attention to detail or hiring a landscape designer to do the work provides your front yard the professional polish it needs.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a fence, give it a fresh coat of paint, whether it is a picket fence in the suburbs or an ironwork fence in the city. Its square footage measurement will determine the cost, as well as what shape it is in. “More labor is required if the fence is in bad condition,” explained Kyle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other more involved and expensive projects include adding a new front walkway or redoing the driveway, a key detail. Kyle said, &#8220;If the driveway is all beat up, the buyer is thinking, &#8216;I am going to have to replace it.'&#8221; The cost of renovating a walkway is also based on the square footage. This is the same for driveways except the cost is measured over the “blacktop, concrete and pavers. Another aspect that plays a part in the price is the elevation,” he said.</p>
<h3><strong>Remodeling and resale highlights</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both the <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Association of Realtors&#8217;</a> 2017 Remodeling Impact Report and <em><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remodeling</a></em>&#8216;s 2018 Cost vs. Value Report survey their audiences to estimate how common improvements affect resale value. Much of the data is based on the opinions of the professionals who were given descriptions of the project. The groups used different methodologies and the results do not perfectly align; however, the results extrapolated below could prove helpful for a homeowner making a renovation decision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Smaller-scale projects run the gamut from a fresh coat of paint on the front door to replacing the entry and garage doors. Larger improvements include repairing the roof to pass inspection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33103 size-chrono" title="Cost of Remodeling Projects for Curb Appeal vs Value Retained at Resale" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1000-Project-Graph-10a-723x815.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="815" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Entry door replacements</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entry door replacements range from installing a steel door at a cost of about $1,400 to $1,700 to a fiberglass door that can cost as much as $9,000. A custom door for a 100-plus-year-old brownstone will be priced higher. In general, installing a steel door will recoup a higher percentage of the original cost, mainly due to the lower upfront cost. But the location also plays a role. In New York, a fiberglass door fetches 90 percent of the original cost, while the national average is 68 percent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, very few projects actually earn back more money than they cost but keep in mind the goal is to bring foot traffic and potential buyers to your door. The exception: garage doors. The National Association of Realtors ranked replacing a garage door third among its eight projects surveyed that earn back their full cost. (A new roof was #1, followed by new vinyl windows). The report also stated that 24 percent of the realtors surveyed suggested to sellers that they replace the garage door, but only 3 percent cited that factor closed the deal with a buyer. On the bright side, the improvement added more than the cost of the project to the value of the home in the New York area.</p>
<h4>Roofing, siding, windows</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Roofing, siding, and windows are big-ticket undertakings that can cost $10,000 to $30,000 and projects that homeowners should consider carefully. Thirty-two percent of the realtors said that a new roof helped close a sale. &#8220;Roofing is important because the home inspector looks at it carefully,&#8221; said Kyle. The inspector will estimate the age and evaluate the condition of the shingles. New siding and windows helped close deals in the single digits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32965 size-chrono" title="house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2-723x482.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Renovation by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Bud</a></p>
<h4><strong>Making a decision on your curb appeal renovations</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What&#8217;s the timetable? If you plan on moving in the future, then a major improvement may be ideal because you can enjoy it while you are still in the house. Then there is the budget and the many things to consider here: the cost of the project, what it adds to the value of the house, the seller&#8217;s equity in the house, and how long will you get to enjoy the improvement before you move.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The last thing you want to do is have your home stick out like a sore thumb,&#8221; said Majid. &#8220;Overall, your safest bet as far as resale value is concerned is to stick with the general look of the neighborhood and neighboring homes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Want to achieve that “welcome factor” you need for a successful resale? Assess the condition of your home—whether its a series of small projects to larger-scale mends—and make a list. When you&#8217;re ready to start, use Sweeten to connect with expert general contractors (for free!) for your curb appeal renovation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting a business is both daunting and exciting. It could mean that you will finally be your own boss, or have a chance to execute on an idea that has beckoned you for years. But that good idea and that excitement do not pay the bills. It will take some meticulous planning to get through a business renovation and end up with an enterprise that not only feeds your soul but pushes your business into the black.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">About 80 percent of small businesses fail in their first year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. One of the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/small-business-central/2017/05/21/what-percentage-of-businesses-fail-in-their-first-year/101260716/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest reasons</a>? They get to the end of their budget by either not making a profit or underestimating the amount of time and capital they will need before crossing over into a profitable business. At <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, we want to see every business succeed. It’s one of the reasons why we offer a free service connecting business owners with fully vetted general contractors when it&#8217;s time to start or expand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are a few ways to make sure you don&#8217;t burn through your business&#8217;s renovation budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-40003 size-full aligncenter" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/HowSweetenWorks.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="50" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Minimize change orders with precise planning</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jimmy Haber knows a thing or two about successfully surviving a business renovation. His company, <a href="https://e2hospitality.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esquared</a>, has a long list of successful restaurants, including the popular vegan dining chain <a href="https://eatbychloe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by CHLOE</a>. For Jimmy, the biggest disrupter to a budget is change orders. These can occur once the scope of work and budget are agreed upon by business owner and contractor, serving up an unexpected addition to the cost and complexity of a project. “A change order can happen for a thousand different reasons,” he said. “It could be as simple as ‘that outlet doesn’t belong there. It is better if it is here.’” Or more complicated such as needing to redo a design feature that doesn’t quite look right or drawing up a budget from a preliminary set of plans rather than a final set.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“You have to go through and meticulously plan everything out,” said Jimmy. Not only will the change order likely add to your budget, since you’re already in agreement with your contractor, it is more difficult to get a competitive price on that additional scope of work. “Because they already have the job, you no longer have any leverage, but they do,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Contingency for staff costs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having a delay in a construction project once new staff already has a start date will put any business owner in a dilemma. If you let those staff members go, then you&#8217;ll have to go through the time-consuming process of re-hiring replacements once you are ready to open. Or, if you want to secure the team you&#8217;ve hired, keeping them on the payroll might be the only way to stop them from going elsewhere. “This can be the most painful and difficult stage that can crush your budget,” said Jimmy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One solution is to be prepared with a contingency line item in the budget for staff costs in the case that construction is delayed and you’ve already hired your staff. Other times it might mean holding on to key staff, like executive chef for a restaurant or a general manager for a retail space, while letting go of those in high turnover positions such as servers.</p>

<p><strong>Keep a line of credit handy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just like a lifebuoy in a pool area, a line of credit should be ready to go if your project needs additional cash to stay afloat, said Andrew Flamm. He is the director of the <a href="https://www.pacesbdc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pace University Small Business Development Center,</a> which connects small business owners with funding as well as support and mentorship. A line of credit is different from a typical term loan. With a term loan, once you are approved you receive it in a lump sum and begin paying interest on it immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A line of credit requires approval; however, it remains in the lender&#8217;s possession. You only access it if and when you need to. You also only begin paying interest on the loan once you start using it and you don’t need to draw on the entire amount available to you. Only take what you need. “Then you are not scrambling to pay a bill or overextending on your credit card,” said Andrew. “That could have implications on your credit score and affect future funding down the road.” Lines of credit usually have a slightly higher interest rate than a term loan, but it could save your business and your personal credit score if you get into a bind.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare to pay operating costs early</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One area that trips up many new businesses is forgetting operating costs while a renovation is in progress, according to Alek Marfisi, a small business consultant with <a href="https://upwindstrategies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upwind Strategies</a>. If you’re building out a space, you will still need to pay utility bills like gas and electricity, internet connection, business liability insurance, and property insurance. Having plenty of temporary working capital on hand is a must for these situations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40462 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Dan-Nelken-UnionSq-Lobby-19.jpg" alt="lobby" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Dan-Nelken-UnionSq-Lobby-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Dan-Nelken-UnionSq-Lobby-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Dan-Nelken-UnionSq-Lobby-19-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Dan-Nelken-UnionSq-Lobby-19-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/union-square-lobby-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A residential lobby renovation</a> in Union Square by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Tim</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Temporary working capital</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition to the contingency funds you need to have to pay for overruns in the cost of construction, you should have enough temporary working capital <span class="s1">to cover at least two months of operating expenses should the construction project take longer than planned. This is p</span></span>art of your entire budget for working capital, and is what helps you handle any unexpected costs compared to permanent working capital, which is what you typically need to run your business. “It will get you through the losses from starting or expanding your business and while you’re not making any money,” said Alek. Temporary working capital covers the construction period and the period of time <span class="s1">in which the business is losing money before it breaks even.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with so many other expenses, these operating costs will need to be paid regardless of whether your renovation project runs on schedule or gets delayed. That’s why these costs should also be factored into a contingency plan in case your opening date gets bumped back.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Managing a successful renovation in your business comes down to detailed planning. Plus, it’s never a bad thing to be overly generous with your contingency line item in your budget so you are ready if something goes wrong. And if it all goes to plan, then there&#8217;s more capital to invest back into your dream business.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-02_lightened.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26708 mb-0 size-chrono" title="a kitchen before demolition" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-02_lightened-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-02_lightened-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-02_lightened-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-02_lightened-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-02_lightened-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-02_lightened.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here on the Sweeten blog, we’ve previously discussed <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leveling bids</a>, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/prep-bid-remodel-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing for bids</a>, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">site visits</a>. Soliciting and comparing bids is one of the first steps of a home renovation project, and it can be daunting to figure out the best way to go about it. At this point, one of your major considerations is likely the budget: how much do you need to spend to get the results you want, and where does the money go? Many homeowners (myself included!) have been tempted to go with labor-only bids from contractors in an attempt to lower costs. Let’s take a look at the pros and cons of labor-only bids versus all-inclusive bids.</p>
<h3>Understanding the difference</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a <strong>labor-only bid</strong>, contractors will identify the labor costs associated with various parts of your project. For example, their bids will include line items such as demolition and installation related to various aspects of your project. We’ve included a sample labor-only bid for an apartment kitchen update in a condo building in the box below. This real-life example is of a 125-square-foot kitchen in Brooklyn, where the Sweeten homeowner was changing out many of the finishes in her kitchen but retaining the existing appliances since they were just a couple years old. She also kept the lower cabinets to create a dual-tone look.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/labor-budget.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26627 mb-0 size-chrono" title="labor-only bid example" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/labor-budget-723x271.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="271" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s take a look now at an <strong>all-inclusive bid</strong> for the same kitchen:</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/allinclusive-budget.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26628 mb-0 size-chrono" title="all-inclusive bid example" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/allinclusive-budget-723x338.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="338" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/allinclusive-budget-723x338.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/allinclusive-budget-300x140.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/allinclusive-budget-600x281.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/allinclusive-budget.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Which is right for you?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bids are very different, but keep in mind the labor-only bid does not include the cost of materials, which you’d still need to account for separately. Let’s break down the difference between the two scenarios.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The truth about material costs</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest differences in price come from the cabinets and countertops (the materials themselves): the new cabinetry comes out to $5,900 and the quartz countertops $5,400. (Since the cabinetry installation for custom work is less labor intensive than assembling and installing modular cabinetry, the labor costs are actually lower on the all-inclusive bid. And because countertop suppliers usually throw in installation as part of the quoted cost, we don’t account for it separately in the labor-only bid.) The question is whether you can find better prices than your contractor. General contractors have partnerships with suppliers and wholesalers that allow them to obtain materials and parts at lower prices, which they can pass onto you. While there will be a markup for their time and effort, the final number may come out fairly close to what you would find on your own.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another note: If you plan to go with <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom cabinets</a>, they will cost more no matter whether you source them from an independent millworker or go through your contractor. Similarly, there are pricing variations on <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countertops</a>, but they should generally be in the same range.    </span></p>
<h3>How much time do you have?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aside from the comparison of the cost of materials, the other major consideration is time. Managing a home renovation can be as time intensive as a job, and labor-only contracts require even more from homeowners in terms of preparation, research, and project coordination than all-inclusive bids. This is because you, as the homeowner, are the de facto project manager, having only delegated part of the job to your contractor. You are still responsible for making decisions on materials, as well as sourcing and coordinating the delivery of all materials to the work site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on the size of the job, this can get very complicated. Some homeowners have shared that significant delays have resulted due to their own miscalculations or oversight about product delivery lead times. This is why some contractors strongly advise/request you let them handle the ordering and delivery logistics. While an all-inclusive bid does not guarantee that there will be no delays, it’s the contractor’s responsibility in that scenario to ensure that all materials arrive in time for each step in the process. As professionals, they are accustomed to all the steps and what needs to arrive when for the project to be completed on time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, while the total price of an all-inclusive bid may look overwhelming at first, it is important to understand what goes into it and assess whether it will save you an enormous amount of time, hassle, and frustration. Centralizing the responsibility with your contractor also makes the process more straightforward. Lastly, to make the decision simple, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<p>*Are you very organized?</p>
<p>*Do you have a lot of time to spend on this renovation project?</p>
<p>*Do you already have very specific ideas about where to source fixtures, tiles, and other materials? (E.g., you already have your eye on those Schoolhouse Electric pendants and have decided on a full <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-kitchen-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA kitchen</a> suite.)</p>
<p>*Are you a designer or have industry connections?</p>
<p>*Is the bottom line the most important thing?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you answered &#8220;yes&#8221; to all of these questions, you may be equipped to tackle a labor-only bid. If you answered &#8220;no&#8221; to any of them, however, an all-inclusive bid is your best bet for a smooth, turnkey home renovation experience.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to #2 in our series, Q&amp;A with Jean, in which I hope to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating. We hear your questions every day and work happily to bring you answers through our team and blog. Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings a new set of circumstances and new queries with it. Feel free to email me at JBrownhill@sweeten.com. In the meantime, I’ll even include questions that I get asked most often—even at cocktail parties!</p>
<p>Today our question is about the costs of home renovation in New York City; if this topic interests you, I&#8217;d suggest checking out our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bath</a> cost guides, including <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Budget Basics: Renovation Costs Per Square Foot</a>.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Why is renovating in New York City so expensive?</p>
<p><strong>JEAN:</strong> Like a lot of things in NYC, it comes down to logistics. For a general contractor to transport the drywall and studs—not mention the many other materials and tools necessary for the job—to your home, the planning can be really complicated. Not only does the team need to get everything to your apartment building, they need to get it up to your floor. Sometimes that means coordinating with an elevator, but in some cases, it can mean using a crane and craning in materials. What adds to the high cost of the materials part of a bid is the logistics.</p>
<p>The labor side of the equation is equally complicated. A lot of renovation projects going on simultaneously in the city and every contractor needs a tiler, a plumber, an electrician, etc. In order to survive the competition, he/she has to pay a premium to get a crew to show up at your job site. It all comes down to supply and demand. There are only so many skilled laborers in the city, and getting those laborers plus materials to your apartment can be challenging. Even for a house in Brooklyn, the crew still has to drive through traffic and bring the drywall from a warehouse that&#8217;s likely stationed in another borough, like Queens. Overall, it’s the cumulative expense of coordinating the drivers, trucks, and deliveries, plus having someone ready to accept deliveries and bring it to your home, that really drives up the cost.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 5 remodeling projects prove that with a $15-20K budget, homeowners can get <em>a lot</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tiles are popping off the wall, the toilet makes a strange gurgling sound when it flushes, and stepping into the shower feels like entering a dark closet. If this situation sounds familiar, then your bathroom is ready for an upgrade. But what will it cost? A $15k-20k budget is an excellent range to cover all the basic bathroom renovation costs—materials, installation, and labor included—for a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toilet</a>, sink, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vanity</a>, fixtures, tile, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooring</a>, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lighting</a>. With that in mind, it’s also important to consider that the need for plumbing, electrical, or layout changes will likely add to the amount. <span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with general contractors showcases five of their bathroom remodels below as</span> good examples of what a $15K-20K budget will allow.</p>
<h3>$15k takes the blues away in a Brooklyn bathroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26277 size-chrono" title="$15k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09-723x964.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="964" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allison and Jovito&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon purchasing a 1910 brick row house, Allison and Jovito got to work on a serious renovation, starting with the upstairs bathroom. The bathroom hadn’t been touched since the 1950s and was very blue—blue tub, blue toilet, blue tile. With a budget of $15k to cover essential bathroom renovation costs, which limited them from expanding the footprint or moving plumbing, the goal was to focus on form and function. A new, dual-flush toilet, console sink, and clawfoot tub—all in white—replaced the original blue fixtures. The simple, classic look they achieved with marble flooring and white subway tile mesh well with the history of the house.</p>
<h3>Sleek fixtures and denim-like tile shine for $15K</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25194 size-chrono" title="$15k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01-723x1066.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1066" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario and Joe&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario and Joe’s main motivation for their apartment renovation was the bathroom. With a budget of $15k, they kicked off their remodel with a gray porcelain tile that had the look of coarse denim and installed it along the floor and vanity wall. The sink was swapped out for a streamlined <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA vanity</a> that was customized to fit a raised basin sink, and the existing mirrored medicine cabinet was replaced with a much larger one. A glass shower door, slim toilet, brushed nickel fixtures, and light above the vanity complete the transformation.</p>
<h3>For $17K, a Brooklyn couple raises the ceiling and gets double cabinet storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25122 size-chrono" title="$17k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000-723x1064.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1064" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-ellen-bens-brooklyn-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellen and Ben&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Kensington, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Budgeting $17k for the bathroom renovation costs, Ellen and Ben decided to focus on modernizing their master bath. To make it feel more open, the stand-up shower and dropped ceiling were removed and replaced with an open shower stall fitted with a glass door. The beige vanity was kicked to the curb and a wooden side table from West Elm, customized to fit a marble countertop and sink, took its place. Two medicine cabinets installed side by side provide ample storage. A new toilet and fixtures complete the functional upgrade, while black hexagon floor tile and floor-to-ceiling white subway tile fulfill the modern aesthetic.</p>
<h3>An architect&#8217;s $20K travel-inspired bathroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24180 size-chrono" title="$20k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-723x1084.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1084" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/an-architect-drafts-a-travel-inspired-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian and Erin&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An uninspired bathroom led Brian and Erin to a $20k remodel that would take their space on an international adventure. The remodel was prompted by outdated fixtures and finishes from the ‘80s and a leak in an upstairs bathroom that had ruined the ceiling. To create a unique space, Brian drew inspiration from the many hotel bathrooms he had seen while traveling for work as an architect. Floor-to-ceiling white subway tile was chosen as a simple backdrop, while blue penny tile was selected for the floor. Mirroring the blue tile, a luxurious clawfoot tub with a blue exterior took the look from standard to standout. The rest of the space was outfitted with a new toilet and bronze fixtures, an antique basin table and sink, and a custom red balau wood medicine cabinet.</p>
<h3>For $20K, everything had to go (except the tub and toilet!)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20616 size-chrono" title="$20k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="509" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-300x211.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celeste&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stained limestone tiling in her bathroom was the tipping point for Celeste, who, after a few unsuccessful attempts to remove the stains, budgeted $20k for bathroom renovation costs. Creating more <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> space became a priority, so a custom vanity with unique drawer configurations was installed. In order to decrease visual clutter, a dedicated spot within the vanity was designed to hold a small trash can. Celeste chose a marble tile with a cube effect for the floor and beveled subway tile for the walls. Although she decided to keep her original tub and toilet, she finished the look with additional new materials like the sink, countertop, and a new lighting fixture.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Westchester County </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no doubt that Westchester is a picturesque place to live—the luxury of space and peace with the bustle of New York City a quick trip away. Some recent buyers and established homeowners alike feel it would be even more idyllic if they had their dream kitchen, whether it&#8217;s renovating a new home or fulfilling a long-desired wish to upgrade. The first step is often the stumbling block: determining the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/kitchen-renovation-costs-money-goes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">national average</a> for a basic 200-square-foot kitchen renovation is $63,829.  Westchester County has a slightly higher average <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation cost</a> landing at <strong>$65,651</strong> or <strong>$328 a square foot</strong>, according to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association (NKBA). Let’s break that budget down into bite-sized pieces to help you get closer to your dream cooking and entertaining space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DESIGN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an important line item in your budget, especially if your vision involves a layout change. That could involve moving load-bearing walls and gas lines. The NKBA estimates design fees eat up about four percent of a kitchen remodel cost. Sweeten designer <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, who has done work in Westchester, said it&#8217;s more realistic to put away 15 percent of your budget for design if you’re in the mood for a major layout change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re giving your kitchen more of a makeover than an overhaul, it’s possible to work closely with an experienced general contractor on the design and forgo a designer. Statistics from the NKBA show that the majority of homeowners relied on a general contractor and only 22 percent used a designer. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck</a>, a Sweeten contractor who works in Westchester, has found that many clients in the county take a hands-on approach to design and often don’t use a designer or architect. However, an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect&#8217;s services will be needed</a> if plumbing or gas lines are moving, there are structural changes, or if a landmark property is being renovated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PERMITS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building permits are handled by the building department of each individual town within Westchester County. &#8220;Individual&#8221; is the key word here because methods of calculations can change dramatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Rye, the most of the <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/money/real-estate/homes/2017/03/22/westchester-priciest-zipcodes/99506058/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive</a> area in Southern Westchester—the median price for a home is $1,380,000—it’s no surprise that building permits are calculated based on the cost of a renovation. For every $1,000 in your kitchen remodel budget, that’s an additional $17 for your building permits. That average $64,000 kitchen overhaul will cost at least $1,088 in permits. If plumbing and electrical permits are required, that’s an additional $200 a pop (for a less extensive renovation, these permits may not be necessary).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the township of Peekskill, building permit costs are at the end of a minor mathematical equation. Multiply the square footage of your project by $150. Then, multiply that figure by 0.10. For a 200-square-foot kitchen, that’s $3,000. So take a moment to look at how the building department of your township calculates permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/westchester-county-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-34831 size-full" title="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png" alt="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" width="320" height="60" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png 320w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>APPLIANCES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Village Appliances in Westchester, a budget appliance package (fridge, oven, dishwasher and microwave), can go for under $5,000. However, Joe Gagliardo, the owner of Village Appliances, doesn’t sell too many of those. The majority of customers either go for a package in the $5,000 to $8,000 range or in the mid-price range of $18,000 to $22,000, which will get you brands such as General Electric and Electrolux. The high-end price spectrum will deliver brands such as Viking and Miele for a four-piece suite (fridge, range, hood, and dishwasher) at a price ranging from $17,000 to $26,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At <a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bilotta Kitchens</a>, clients often buy in the $12,000 to $15,000 range for an appliance package, according to senior designer and CKD Randy O’Kane. This will get you brands such as Thermador, Sub-Zero, and Wolf. There’s always room to mix and match, but brands do offer a discount or throw in items like blenders, toasters and hoods for free if you go with the same brand for your appliances, Randy said. “It is the heart and soul of a kitchen,” she said. “Cabinets are great, but it is all about cooking.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation can cost between $500 and $1,000, and that price will depend on how much work your contractor has already done. If water lines have not been run or outlets are not in the necessary areas, that could push up installation costs, Joe said. For those after custom range hoods, then plan for the $2,000 and $8,000 range.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CABINETS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinets and hardware (think handles and knobs) are a big-ticket item on every kitchen remodel cost budget. They typically take up 30 percent of costs, according to NKBA. In a basic kitchen renovation, that’s $6,000. For a major overhaul worth $60,000, cabinets cost almost $20,000. What typically makes a big <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difference in cabinet cost</a> is whether you want custom, pre-fabricated or a mix of both. Something pre-fabricated from IKEA or Home Depot will cost around $130 a linear foot. Custom jobs can shoot up to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear square foot</a>. However, with that higher price, there is more freedom in deciding your kitchen layout. You can also get <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a> with custom cabinets. Semi-custom cabinets generally are about 50 percent cheaper than full custom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or do what Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill did in her own kitchen renovation: the recycled customized option. &#8220;I scoured Renovation Angel&#8217;s website and purchased a used-but-high-end kitchen for about $10,000, which is what I could have spent on cabinets alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A complete kitchen included appliances and cabinetry.&#8221; Jean then customized the cabinets to fit her space, which often meant filler panels were wider on one side than the other, or building a soffit was necessary. &#8220;It was like working on a jigsaw puzzle in order to make the kitchen look like it fit in the space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I was okay with these kinds of imperfections in exchange for essentially getting a premium kitchen on an Ikea type of budget.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>COUNTERTOPS</strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.westchesterkitchenandbath.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester Kitchen and Bath</a>, quartz is overwhelmingly the most popular countertop, according to showroom manager and designer Donna Magnotta. “It’s heat-, stain-, scratch-, and bacteria-resistant,” she said, “and it&#8217;s maintenance-free.” Natural stones, like marble, need routine staining and sealing. Quartz starts around $85 per linear foot and is on the mid to high-end of the price scale, which includes the cost of fabricating and installing. Laminate starts at $20 a linear foot, but is rarely purchased, Donna said. Granite is next up the ladder at about $35 a linear foot. On the high end, natural stones start at about $120 a linear foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LIGHTING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kitchen lighting isn’t a big budget line item. It takes up on four percent of total costs on average. The end price, of course, will always be determined by your tastes. In a $20,000 kitchen, that’s only $800. For a major remodel in the $60,000 range, lighting costs look closer to $2,400.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PLUMBING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On an average remodel, plumbing costs are about the same at $800. If there is a layout change to your Westchester kitchen, then that will likely add to your plumbing costs, which also includes gas lines. And the more you alter the basic layout of your space, the more your kitchen remodel cost will increase for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting, and inspections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FLOORING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a budget, Westchester’s <a href="https://suburbanfloors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suburban Floors</a> has a vinyl Karndean-Knight Tile that is $3.50 a square foot that is “still very durable and stylish,” said Emily Carpentieri, the store’s owner. The price per square foot does not include installation. On the higher end is cork or wide-plank wood flooring. These go for $8.25 to $15 a square foot. But vinyl floors in the $5 to $7 range is Suburban Floors’ biggest seller. “These would blow your mind how real they looked,” said Emily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LABOR AND INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction labor can change depending upon your Westchester zip code. The costs are less expensive the further you are from NYC. For Peekskill, labor costs are 22 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr.com</a>. Dobbs Ferry comes in at 40 percent higher and Croton-on-Hudson at 27 percent higher than the national average. The kitchen renovation cost in Rye could have a labor budget 55 percent above the national average. To compare, the labor cost for a kitchen renovation on the Upper East Side is 77 percent higher than the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t forget installation for appliances, cabinetry, plumbing, and electrical. These typically take about 17 percent of a budget, which is about $3,500 for an average kitchen. And as mentioned above, factor in $500 to $1,000 for appliance installation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, renovations are like fingerprints<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no two are alike. That includes their budgets. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator in Westchester allocated their $56,620 renovation budget:</p>

			<h2>Know the process and costs for replacing electrical wiring at home to keep your renovation surprise-free</h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Electrical_work_costs-2.jpg" alt="A gut renovation with tangled electrical wires hanging from the ceiling" width="1000" height="665" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52082" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Electrical_work_costs-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Electrical_work_costs-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Electrical_work_costs-2-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">New homeowners and prospective buyers in NYC often learn that electrical upgrades might be needed for a decade- or century-old apartment or townhouse. “Electrical work,” though, is a vague term that ranges from installing a light fixture to replacing a building’s internal wiring. So you&#8217;re wondering: what does it </span><span class="s2">cost to replace electrical wiring</span><span class="s3"> in a home? </span><span class="s1">Sweeten offers some tips and expert advice about electrical work and potential costs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Because electrical magic happens behind walls, forecasting the scope of additions and </span><span class="s2">costs to update electrical wiring </span><span class="s1">can be challenging. Those cost estimates are also crucial if you’re budgeting for a renovation or for a new home purchase.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">How do I know what kind of electrical work a place needs?</span></h3>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Analyzing the existing electrical</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Contractors will first examine the electrical panel (or “box”) to determine circuit load capacity. In other words, what more can the existing wiring handle? Experienced contractors can generally tell by looking at the circuits what can and cannot be done. That is, do you need to add more capacity to the existing system? Or, upgrade to a larger panel because slots for breakers are full?</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Electrical needs for older homes</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Pre-war apartments that haven’t been updated in decades often need significant electrical re-wiring and additional wattage to support modern electrical demands. Many NYC buildings constructed through the early part of the twentieth century were multi-layered with older wiring systems. Some have ungrounded systems that lack code-approved grounding conductors. Others have metallic insulation materials like aluminum or copper wiring that may actually increase the chances of electrical shock or fire. These older wiring systems, typically with 60 to 100 amps of service, violate <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/downloads/bldgs_code/electrical_code_local_law_39of2011.pdf"><span class="s4">current electrical codes</span></a>. They also fall short of the standard minimum of 200 amps generally needed to power a home.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">According to N.Y.-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor Frank</a>, “I’ve done a lot of new services, and I recommend having new electrical. When you spend X amount of dollars on the apartment renovation, you need everything to be working.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ultimately, the electrical code determines what’s required, and it’s highly detailed. Each room must have a light fixture, for example, and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors must be hardwired. (This is because battery-powered models are not allowed.) This evaluation of your system is part of your walk-through with your general contractor.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">What if I just want to install new appliances?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Installing air conditioners, appliances, or entertainment systems may seem simple. However, these can quickly overwhelm an older building’s capacity. Your home’s electrical load capacity is like a surge protector on a much larger scale. If you have too many wires plugged into an outlet, the circuit may overload. That leads to tripped breakers and blown fuses that shut down all power. So, if your electrical system is not capable of handling the additional load, a relatively straightforward appliance installation could become a much more invasive and substantial project. Installing a new electrical circuit panel or a complete overhaul of the electrical wiring may be possible.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One clear example is air conditioning. “For homes without central AC,” general contractor Frank noted, “you have to run a dedicated line in every room for an AC unit. It could be either a wall unit or a window unit, but each room has to have a dedicated outlet for the AC unit.” Kitchens and bathrooms are not included in this requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Each circuit is wired from that AC unit to the panel with no other devices drawing power from it. That can add up to a substantial amount of new wiring to meet code, and it’s not optional. The entire system must be brought up to code, whether or not you install an AC unit. As for cost for this project, it’s highly variable and, as always, depends partly on the panel having capacity for new circuits. A dedicated line, Frank said, “would run between <strong>$300</strong> and <strong>$1,000</strong>.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">How does rewiring work? </span></h3>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">The electrical rewiring process</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If your place is in for a full electrical upgrade, you need to plan and budget for a labor-intensive and disruptive process. Your electrician will temporarily shut off power and your contractor will open up the walls. Since wires are attached to framing within the walls, rewiring can be very invasive. Your team might completely demolish entire walls to access all the old wires and replace them. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One type of surprise for homeowners, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/7085" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor Mohsen</a>, who is based in New York, is framing changes. Bringing older homes and apartments up to modern standards may require adjusting the existing framing to accommodate new equipment.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s5">“</span><span class="s6">What is behind the ceiling? Do we have enough space for recessed lights?” he said. “Do we have enough space for the fan? Choosing a fan that doesn’t fit the space may require reframing. Sometimes dropping the entire bathroom ceiling for the fan can also be a surprise,” Mohsen added.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">How much will </span><span class="s2">electrical wiring cost</span><span class="s1">?</span></h3>
<h4 class="p6"><span class="s6">Budgeting for an electrical overhaul</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To finish, the walls are plastered and painted. The electrician connects the remaining switches and outlets, closes up the new electrical panel, and installs light fixtures. The full </span><span class="s2">electrical wiring cost</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s1">of this kind of project, with demolition, permits, labor, materials, construction, and painting can cost from<b> $15,000 and up</b> depending on the size of your space and extent of work. If you are gut-renovating an entire home, a full electrical overhaul might represent somewhere around <strong>5%</strong> <strong>of your total budget</strong>. If your renovation is limited to a particular room (like a kitchen), a full electrical overhaul may end up matching or exceeding the total cost of the project you&#8217;re planning. The </span><span class="s2">costs to update electrical wiring in a home</span><span class="s3"> involve more than just electrical work.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Rewiring aside, what else might I need for electrical work?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Contractors assess electrical needs and costs for clients based on a series of questions:</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">1. What is already in place vs. what you are trying to accomplish?</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Identify what kind of light fixtures or electrical systems are in place and what’s not there. If you want to install lighting, put in a security system, or run a phone line in a particular location that doesn’t have existing wiring, contractors have to perform an electrical “rough-in.”  That is the preliminary step to lay out the basic wiring to proper specifications before connections and insulation are completed</span><span class="s7">. The rough-in cost is generally calculated by the length of the wiring lines installed (linear feet running from the circuit box to the point where outlets and switches are mounted), the cost of materials, and the labor rate. Rough-ins might also be charged at a flat rate of <b>$250–$400 </b>per junction box, outlet, or switch. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">2. What type of light fixtures and finishes do you want and how many do you need?</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Contractors charge labor costs that include running cables to devices and connecting wiring to circuit boxes based on the number and type of fixtures you want to install. Generally, swapping an old light fixture for a new one comes in at around <b>$100 </b>per fixture or at an hourly fee. Installing new fixtures like pendants and recessed LED lights comes in at around <b>$200–$400</b> per fixture and larger, heavier fixtures like chandeliers cost in the range of <b>$500–$800</b> per fixture.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">3. How much amp service does your electrical panel hold?</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Electrical panels in NYC usually hold 200 amps of service, so if your electrical service is short of that, the system won’t have enough power or space in the circuit box to accommodate new demands. In this case, you need to upgrade your electrical panel, which can cost <b>$2,000</b> to <b>$5,000 and up</b> for a new box<i>.</i> If you have an existing electrical panel with enough room for new circuits but you’re planning a renovation that might add some heavy-duty appliances, you may want to consider adding a new circuit breaker, which typically costs <b>$300</b> to <b>$800</b> per breaker in order to accommodate a higher electrical capacity load. Adding a new circuit to the panel allows you to install more outlets, which generally cost around <b>$100</b> to <b>$300</b> per outlet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Frank noted that older homes with outdated service may present an unwelcome surprise if the service to the house is inadequate. He recently completed a project that required new 200-amp service from the street, as the existing service was only 80 amps. That new service required the electric company to run a new buried line to the house, and also required trenching in the yard and a new poured concrete sidewalk. All that work cost the homeowners <strong>$5,000</strong> before Frank could even get to work inside the home.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Permits and processes for electrical work</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For anything other than a fixture swap or a straightforward appliance installation, you will need an electrician licensed by the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/index.page"><span class="s4">Department of Buildings</span></a> who must first file an electrical application and pay permit fees in order to conduct electrical work. Once a permit is obtained, an inspection must take place, and a certificate is mailed to ensure that the work was properly completed and inspected.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s8">cost to replace electrical wiring</span><span class="s1"> is hugely variable. Balancing current wiring with future needs while meeting code is complex and requires a competent professional electrician.</span></p>
