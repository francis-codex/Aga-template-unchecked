<h3 class="p5">Living with a yesteryear Philadelphia bathroom</h3>
<p><i>Tiny pink south Philly row home bathroom needs a complete renovation,</i> our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> project post read. We attached photos, featuring not only the Pepto-toned tiles, but teal-colored rugs and seashell wallpaper. They’d been photographed three years earlier, but little had changed—proof that the project was way overdue. The bathroom hadn’t been renovated since the home was built in 1920.</p>
<p class="p6"><i><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11.jpg" alt="Portrait of Sweeten homeowners" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></i></p>
<p class="p6">We’re Kait and Patrick, former renters who jumped to buy a fixer-upper as we watched housing prices tick up in our ideal Philadelphia neighborhoods. When we purchased our 1,400-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-know-when-remodeling-a-philadelphia-rowhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">row house in the southern Point Breeze/Newbold</a> area a few years ago, we completed renovations including laying new floors, adding central air, skim-coating and painting the walls, and installing a new kitchen. But we didn’t have the budget to renovate the old bathroom.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Learning from past renovations</h3>
<p class="p6">As anyone can see, the bathroom was ugly. The floor tile didn’t coordinate with the walls. Everything was old and stained; no amount of cleaning made it look presentable. But it was our only bathroom (unless you count the creepy basement toilet and slop sink). When the time came to remodel it, our immediate priorities were practical: finding a contractor who could complete the project in a reasonable amount of time and without sacrificing the quality of materials or workmanship.</p>
<p class="p6"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before.jpg" alt="Split images of the bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52404" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p class="p6">Then there was the goal: To create something that would feel like a sanctuary. With that vision in mind, we put a lot of effort into interviewing contractors who responded to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/86002#before" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Sweeten project posting</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6178#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired our general contractor</a>. In our last renovation, honestly, we had terrible experiences. Like with the contractor who demolished our kitchen so prematurely that we lived without a kitchen for eight months. We were determined to prevent another debacle like that.</p>
<p class="p6">The bathroom was chaotic and we lived with it for a long time, but the chance to improve it came sooner than expected. After twice canceling our wedding due to Covid, we eloped and put the money saved towards the bathroom project. Our families and friends were generous with wedding gifts, further helping us fund the job.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p6">The small-spaced bathroom stays small</h3>
<p class="p6">From the first planning phases, we knew we would have no layout changes. We didn’t want to expand into any of the bedrooms, so we agreed that the bathroom would remain really small. We set out to use every inch.</p>
<p class="p6">Making the bathroom functional—versus crammed—meant we had to be intentional with the size of everything. The original bathtub was designed for shorter people, so finding one that could fit my 6’3” husband was a must, and we eventually did. We chose a trim toilet and a vanity that is narrow, but offers storage. We opted for a barn door-style glass shower enclosure to let the light flow through and open up the space.</p>
<p class="p6"><b><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08.jpg" alt="Vanity and mirror with bronze hardware" width="1000" height="1501" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></p>
<h3 class="p6">Choosing neutral with a pop</h3>
<p class="p6">We also achieved a visual openness with color, or lack of it. We used a lot of bold hues in the rest of our house; we wanted this to be a departure from that, so we went with gray and white. But with this neutral tile choice, we started to <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/how-to-splash-a-bath-with-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worry that the bathroom would be boring</a>—even if it did feel bigger, and calmer. We added the gold fixtures to give it a luxe feel. The pink paint is a sort of homage to the old bathroom.</p>
<h3 class="p6">The right renovation team</h3>
<p>Throughout the project, our Sweeten contractor gave honest recommendations and feedback. He was straightforward about what tile and fixtures would work best and be most durable. We received a lot of check-ins from Sweeten as the project progressed; it was helpful to know we had extra support if we needed it.</p>

<p class="p6">We love the result. The super deep soaking tub is amazing and was absolutely worth the money. I love that, unlike with the previous bathroom, I’m not aggravated by the decor when I walk in. Long overdue indeed. We’re so happy we made the most of nearly two tough years and turned this bathroom into a peaceful haven we both love.</p>

</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Michele</i></span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Getting excited to renovate</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I lead a digital product design team for a large San Francisco-based company. I’ve lived in this apartment for a little over a decade, and I had been meaning to renovate my bathroom since I moved in, but I always found a reason not to. The bath hadn’t had an upgrade since the building’s 1980s conversion to co-op! The pedestal sink wasn’t fully attached to the wall, the tub tiles were loosening, and the glass tile floor, which a previous owner had painted, was flaking.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">My apartment is on the top floor of a 1910s five-story building, and it suffered damage during a co-op-sponsored roof renovation a couple of years back. When the building’s contractor completed the repairs, I got excited about renovating. My recently acquired work-from-home job gave me more incentive. I’d updated my home office to suit the remote role, but experiencing my out-of-date bathroom all day, every day, prompted me to get planning.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Finding inspiration from other renovators</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I spent so much time on Sweeten, reading this blog, and looking at other people’s projects! It was a tremendous help seeing what other people had done. </span><span class="s5">I had strong ideas about how I wanted to proceed, but I needed help turning them into particular products, finishes, and colors.</span> <span class="s1">Sweeten provided me with a range of contractors and design-build firms who gave me numerous options. I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5415#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose my Sweeten contractor</a> because his ideas matched mine.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I’d done advance planning for the bathroom and had a clear idea of what I wanted: a floating vanity, a drop-in tub, oversized subway tile, and dramatic tile flooring. I was attracted to images of gray kitchens and bathrooms with boldly patterned floors. I envisioned something that was calm and streamlined, to make the space feel bigger and take advantage of the high ceiling. My apartment is modern and open. I wanted the bath and kitchen to feel integrated, rather than set apart from the rest of the space.</span></p>

<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A new dishwasher becomes a full kitchen remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, my plan had been to simply install a new dishwasher. Then it was suggested that a pantry could be added in the then-unused space at the kitchen’s entrance. The original kitchen plan I had posted to Sweeten was of a smaller scope, but after meeting them, I asked the contractors to submit follow-up <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bids for a full kitchen remodel</a>.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, I worked with my contractor to come up with a plan. I put together the light and dark gray cabinets with chrome handles and found a quartz countertop flecked with both colors. I picked the same flooring that the designer had used in their showroom.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Transforming the bathroom wasn’t so hard. I saw a tile floor I liked in the sale listing of another apartment in my building and tracked it down. Finding a bathtub that would fit the small space was a challenge, but we did. (The white tub looked yellow next to the tile, so we had it reglazed.) Because of pipes in the wall, we couldn’t create storage niches in the shower, so the team extended the interior windowsill with a white quartz surface material—a shampoo perch. The floating sink is mounted a bit higher than standard because I’m tall.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A timely business trip</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The project’s biggest challenge was also something of a stroke of luck: My boss asked me to travel from New York to San Francisco, starting the day demolition began. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I stayed for almost three weeks</a>. While I was away, the Sweeten construction team kept me posted and sent pictures daily. The contractor was great at explaining problems long-distance: I’ll never forget the crew piling on a conference call about my formerly crooked bathroom wall while I waited outside an executive office at work!</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Instead of hiring a project manager, I worked as my own. I had spreadsheets for how much had been spent versus budgeted. I tracked what had been ordered, shipped, and delivered. I’m not that organized, but I turned into a full-on spreadsheet ninja. It kept me from panicking.</span></p>
<div><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-47060 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></div>
<h3 class="p5">Finishing the bathroom and kitchen renovation during COVID-19</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">By the time COVID-19 hit and the lockdown was ordered, we were 95 percent done. We had to wait for the lockdown to lift and for my building to let the crew return, clearly articulating when they would arrive, and wearing masks as required.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Eventually, we finished. After expanding my renovation’s scope, I spent significantly more than I originally intended to—close to $100,000 all told, but that includes fully updated plumbing and new floors in both rooms. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I have enough storage space in the kitchen and bathroom that nothing falls out when I open a cabinet! I love cooking; I’ve got a lot of ingredients and equipment, and it’s so nice not to feel like I’m overstuffing every corner. Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment! I’m also enjoying the dishwasher. I love the way the kitchen tile feels under my feet, and how the rooms are designed for me, with my interests and needs—even my career—in mind. That customization is the greatest luxury of the whole thing.</span></p>

<h3>Lightening the mood</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I could have done a lot worse than this hand-me-down—a West Village apartment that my mom and dad purchased in 2016. My sister, Lindsay, lived in the studio for a couple of years until she moved in with her boyfriend in Brooklyn. I’d gotten my career in fundraising events off the ground, and I decided to leave my roommates in Murray Hill and move in.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The apartment is in a co-op building that was built in 1915. It’s small—approximately 320 square feet—and had accumulated some </span><span class="s5">questionable design touches from long ago</span><span class="s1">. Paneled walls, painted in a pretty but dark shade of teal, and distressed wood trim gave the place a downbeat vibe. It was so dark that I had at times referred to it as “The Dungeon.” Brightening the space was my priority.</span></p>

<h3>Choosing materials for resale in the future</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s6"><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renovating the studio apartment</a> was a family project, planned with my </span><span class="s1">mom, Reneé, and my dad, John. This was our first renovation in New York City and we were nervous. We didn’t know where to find a contractor or what standard pricing would be. Where to start? To add to the challenge, we decided to keep the budget down by not hiring a designer. I would make most of the design decisions myself. We started by posting our project to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46932" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It’s best to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know the process and design plan</a> before you start a project. I wanted it to feel light, warm, cozy, and fun. It also felt important to create a home that would appeal to future buyers. As much as I love this place, it’s a studio—it likely won’t be my “forever home.” So I tried to pick materials that <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept the kitchen current and timeless</a> and the bathroom neutral. I created a document with inspiration photos and a materials list for each room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared it with our Manhattan contractor</a> as soon as we offered him the job.</span></p>

<span class="s1">&#8220;Our contractor had great ideas, and one particular staffer was super helpful sourcing the products I wanted.&#8221;</span>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My family and I agreed we would tear out the ugly paneling in hopes of <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/studio-grows-into-junior-one-bedroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opening up the studio&#8217;s main living</a> and sleeping space; white walls and recessed lighting would brighten the space. Meanwhile, painting the window in charcoal frames the natural light coming in. </span><span class="s1">Next up was the kitchen, which had newish appliances, but needed most everything else, from repainting the cabinets to new floor tile, countertops, and backsplash. To <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refresh the bathroom</a>, we would paint, replace wall and floor tiles, update the shower, and add a new vanity, mirror, and lighting fixtures.</span></p>
<h3>Discovering hidden arches</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">We were excited when our general contractor got started at the beginning of March 2020. During demolition, we found the arched doorways inside the apartment. We’d had no idea about these beautiful, curved pass-throughs—they’d been covered up with drywall and paneling. It was great to find a bit of the apartment’s original charm still intact. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46937 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To modernize, we focused on lighting and thought about storage (a vanity with storage and a wall-mounted shoe rack)—vital aspects of the project in this tiny space. </span><span class="s1">I gave a lot of thought to creating a mix of open and closed storage. All the pretty stuff goes on the open shelving, and everything unsightly or rarely used has a spot to hide in.</span></p>
<h3>Renovating during COVID-19</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Once we’d started working, the biggest challenge we had was dealing with COVID-19. A couple of weeks after our demolition phase, New York City shut down. Our Sweeten contractor was helpful in dealing with all the new health-related laws, as well as our co-op’s rules. As the pandemic escalated, only a few workers were allowed on-site, staying distanced; toward the end, it was only one worker at a time.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I ended up leaving Manhattan to quarantine at my family’s home, and as the situation worsened, most design choices had to be discussed over text, email, or FaceTime. Our contractor had great ideas, and one particular staffer was super helpful in <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sourcing the products</a> I wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">After a last-minute decision to change the floors, within a few hours, I found floor samples, ordered them for curbside pickup, chose, and ordered the boards so our contracting team could pick them up at an NYC location. Our contractor installed them the next day. It was stressful, but I love what we ended up with!</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The challenges of the pandemic pushed our timeline from two months to three, but we didn’t care—we wanted the work to be done safely. Our contractor was <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diligent in our communication</a> emailing us progress photos every week and scheduling FaceTime walkthroughs. He notified our building’s management company and us if loud work was planned so that neighbors could be warned. This was especially important since everyone was working from home!</span></p>
<h3>Reno tips from the homeowner</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Even in these lean and uncertain times, my advice is to add a buffer to the budget—there is always a surprise, or a little project, to add. I love the creative side, picking out materials, and deciding what worked best together. We certainly did not <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep costs under our budget</a>. Not even close! We ended up spending about $70,000 on this project.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the end, thanks to my family, luck, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding our Sweeten contractor</a>, I’m immensely happy! It’s so comforting to come home. I wanted to modernize the apartment, brighten it, and bring it into this decade—and that’s precisely what we did.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you for sharing your West Village co-op renovation with us, Taylor! We love how your 320-square-foot space turned out.</i></span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Erica</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to believe a wall can have such a profound impact on how two people share space. Our kitchen, once barely big enough for one person, was transformed into what kitchens are meant to be: the heart of the home. Our 800-square-foot Clinton Hill apartment was a loved space, in every sense of the word. My then-fiancé, Joshua, moved in and we decided to renovate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before Joshua joined me, I imagined what would happen if the wall between the living room and kitchen came down. Now that it was two of us, changes seemed necessary. Along with the wall, Joshua also dreamed of replacing the parquet floors with hardwood. (I much preferred parquet so those conversations often ended in agreeing to disagree.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our apartment and all its quirks and beauties were familiar. We knew how we used the space, and which areas needed to become a better fit. We had a<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> budget for the kitchen</a> and vision. But who could we trust to help us move forward with our ideas? Just choosing the right paint color felt overwhelming, so finding the right designer was a challenge. </span></p>

</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten.com, and selected a firm with design/build services. The general contractor was familiar with the</span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clinton Hill Co-ops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the complexities that exist in these apartments, which were originally constructed in the early 1940s. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44832 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that first warm fall evening, she sat in our living room and listened carefully as we described what we hoped our home would be. We knew we wanted to remove a wall, upgrade the contractor-grade cabinetry, replace the appliances, and install under-cabinet lighting. But we were unsure of the process and the things we could not see. After talking, she immediately popped up and put her superhero design tools to work—her x-ray vision which saw through walls, and her tape measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial sketches removed the wall between the kitchen and the dining area completely, as well as part of the wall between the kitchen and the living room. We were seeking to strike a balance between Joshua’s partiality to completely open spaces and my desire to keep some visual privacy. Receptive to our decision to keep the entire wall between the living room and kitchen intact, the plan removed only the wall between the kitchen and the dining area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our contractor’s keen eye helped us ask so many more questions about the space. I never noticed that the sightlines of our parquet floors were uneven and misaligned. (Joshua was right. We needed to replace the floors.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="tile backsplash" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22219" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized that the space would be transformed in ways I was not expecting the moment she began to speak of light from the kitchen window spilling into the back corner of the living room. With the wall down, of course, the kitchen window would be visible as you enter the apartment. The decision to move the refrigerator out of the original kitchen footprint into what was once a hallway closet provided more options on where the sink and dishwasher could be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew that our Sweeten contractor had expertise in millwork. Our kitchen, filled with unexpected nooks and crannies, was a design dilemma that custom cabinetry could solve. I envisioned white cabinetry to brighten up the kitchen, and we trusted our contractor’s desire to include natural wood via open shelving and some cabinetry with a walnut finish. The shelving she created is the perfect platform for us to display our spices, cookbooks, vases, and the all-important pilon for grinding plantains.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. “I’m so nervous,” I admitted.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a designer, she not only considered ways to bring more storage and surface area into the kitchen, but also a new hue. One afternoon we perused our choices at their warehouse in Queens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every tile seemed to fall short—wrong tint, incorrect size, too dominating, etc. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then Joshua’s eye caught a simple hexagonal tile of soft turquoise blue. This 3D recycled glass tile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complemented the cabinetry color, the wood finish, and it was the right size. The result is a beautiful canvas that pulls the white cabinetry and quartz countertops together. Last, but certainly not least, it serves as a surprising showcase for my favorite red cast iron Dutch oven.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making decisions was easy. Rather than ask us to look at every iteration of countertop or knob, our contractor presented us with a few options, and the design sensibility connected across the space. The nickel handles on the cabinet doors pick up the subtle specks of silver accents in the quartz countertops coordinating well with the steel appliances.  I only noticed it once the kitchen was complete. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to come up with secondary plans for overhead lighting since the ceiling was made of concrete. The</span><a href="https://www.cb2.com/"> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">floor lamp now illuminates our favorite round dining table. The gooseneck sconce creates the perfect corner for working on a laptop at our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/">kitchen peninsula</a>, which can now accommodate someone cooking at the same time. The peninsula also has generous storage on two sides—four very deep drawers and a small cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, when you walk into our apartment, three things jump out at you: the welcoming natural light that flows in from the windows, rich wood elements on the cabinetry and shelving, and the turquoise tile of the backsplash.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44834" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The builders and carpenters of our design-build firm are true craftspeople. The care with which they handled each task was notable. They produced perfectly mitered corners, laid the floor with precision, and cleaned up at the end of each day. We felt like we were in good hands the entire way through. I’d notice an imperfection, and before I could say anything, they had fixed it. Truly top-notch workmanship. They were so thoughtful about the space that it made our decision to stay in the apartment throughout the renovation easy. “Just think of it like camping,” Joshua said one night as we dined in our bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. “I’m so nervous,” I admitted. &#8220;Don’t worry,&#8221; she warmly replied. &#8220;You’re gonna love it.”  Debris and concrete walls filled much of the living area after the first demolition day, but we felt the homeyness of the space. The light from the newly visible window greeted us as we entered in a way we never expected. I looked at Joshua and said, “I didn’t realize how much of me was in this place. Now we get to create this space together.” We couldn’t relish it more!</span></p>

</ul>
<h3>A fresh minimalist space</h3>
<p><span class="s1">A Manhattan apartment with wall-to-wall windows overlooking Park Avenue demands an undistracting interior. That’s just one reason why it was a match for John, a minimalist seeking to upsize in the city. The finance exec closed on the two-bedroom abode in the Murray Hill neighborhood and was committed to an expansive renovation before moving in. Aspiring to a modern, clean aesthetic, he hired <a href="https://aurorafarewell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architect and designer Aurora Farewell</a>, who works in New York and Connecticut, to oversee the project and to take the space to spare and spectacular. Aurora posted the project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, and together with John chose their Sweeten contractor. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41911 size-full" title="portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19.jpg" alt="portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p><span class="s1">For John, the decision to finally purchase an apartment of his own in Manhattan was two-fold. First, he’d been renting for years, initially a studio and then a one-bedroom apartment, both in a nearby area of Midtown East, and he wanted more space. Second, he was ready for a serious investment: John wanted to begin building equity in a luxury apartment. What better place than in a full-service condo on a prime Park Avenue block? </span></p>

<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41902 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-10.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Expanding living space</h3>
<p><span class="s1">The 1,200-square-foot unit, which had giant, greenhouse-style windows in nearly every room, was in an upscale building in the high 30s, and had everything—room to stretch, impressive sunlight, and 24-hour views of one of the city’s best architectural catwalks.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">John lived in his former apartment until his new home renovation was complete. “I closed on it in July 2018 and the renovation began in October,” he said, after he had obtained building and city approvals. The new apartment, he said, more or less doubled his living space. John was an experienced renovator, having done previous construction on homes in Utah and Florida. He had a vision and a good idea of how he wanted to approach the redo. “The biggest questions I had,” he said, “were ‘<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How much will this cost</a>?’ and ‘How long will it take?’”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">I was hoping to not have to use my oven for file storage anymore.</span></p></blockquote>

<h3>Taking down walls</h3>
<p><span class="s1">The unit, in a 20-year-old building, had a layout that felt inefficient, if not unlivable, John said. His biggest gripe was an awkward partition wall that closed off the kitchen from the living and dining rooms. </span><span class="s2">According to his architect, they worked to create an open floor plan unifying the kitchen, dining, and living spaces, “as well as to allow for a more gracious master bath and master bedroom.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Next, they moved on to a long list of features and finishes, all of which, John said, was “in working condition, but dated.” A simple design was needed based on clean lines and spare decor. He favored neutral “background” colors on walls, floors and cabinets, and furnishings that were practical and useful.</span></p>

<h3>Practical goals</h3>
<p><span class="s1">Aurora agreed with John’s ideas and thought they meshed perfectly with her own vision, focused largely on the apartment’s bank of east-facing windows. “The </span><span class="s2">tall panes of glass overlook the stately building façades that line Park Avenue, and up to the sky,” she said. “The morning light in the apartment was beautiful, and I wanted to fix the layout so that John could appreciate it in full.” As it was, she said, the window wall’s impressive span was broken by the kitchen partition, plopped right in the middle of—and from either side blocking—the breathtaking view.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">After reviewing the multiple Sweeten bids, Aurora and John decided on their contractor, who coordinated with them and advised on a number of aspects of the project. In addition to the literal big picture, Aurora and John had practical goals. “I was hoping to not have to use my oven for file storage anymore,” he said, stressing that this was not an exaggeration. </span></p>
<p><span class="s3"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41907 size-full" title="dining space" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15.jpg" alt="dining space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3>Adding hidden storage</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Seeking to maximize the amount of storage space in the apartment without compromising on design, they decided to rip out the wall between the kitchen and dining area, which came at the expense of the pre-existing utility closets that had been built into it. To compensate, the contractor built two closets on opposite walls of the dining area, one to accommodate coats and luggage, and the other to store sporting goods and other sundry stuff. With that wall out of the way, the contractor’s team installed the new kitchen comprising slate-gray designer cabinetry, Calacatta marble countertops, and high-end stainless-steel appliances.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Storage was a priority for other rooms as well. In the master bedroom, the plan dictated bumping into the current clothes closet, which would then be expanded on the opposite side, in addition to building a new shoe closet. The guest bedroom, which would also function as John’s home office, would be kitted out with enclosed cabinets and shelving.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41895 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03.jpg" alt="bathroom cabinet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Gutted bathrooms with complete upgrades</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The bathrooms, both of which were gut-renovated, received complete upgrades with porcelain tile, patterns, and custom millwork. In the master bathroom, Aurora increased the functionality with a new linen closet, which the contractor bumped into a wall in order to build. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The<span style="color: #333333;"> six-</span>month renovation went smoothly, John said, with “no major hiccups along the way,” save the necessary pulling of an unanticipated permit from the New York City Department of Buildings before the removal of the kitchen partition. The wall, the architect explained, was non-load-bearing but still tricky to take down, since it was part of the building’s original construction plan.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41896 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3>Crediting the contractors</h3>
<p><span class="s1">John credited his Sweeten contractor as a key player in the project, noting that the building team was among the critical reasons why the project was a success. He suggested taking all you can from the experts you’ve assembled to help you through the project, while at the same time tuning in to your own intuition. “Once you make a decision,” he said, “stick with it. Otherwise, you run the risk of not only second-guessing yourself, but of delaying delivery of materials and installation. If one step in the process is delayed, it can have a domino effect on subsequent tasks.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">John said that those steps, at least when they proceeded smoothly, were some of the most satisfying components of the job, day-by-day, and week-by-week, as he watched his new space change. What came slowly at the beginning then accelerated, transforming to progress and carrying through to a pleasing conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I feel,” John said, “like I’ve found not just a place to live and sleep, but a permanent home in the city.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you, John, for sharing your new home with us!</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">DESIGN NOTES FROM ARCHITECT AURORA FAREWELL AS TOLD TO SWEETEN:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">We wanted to appreciate the natural light in full. Unfortunately, it was interrupted by the dividing wall, home to closets and a massive fridge. We agreed a continuous row of windows would be better. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We relied on light fixtures to act as focal points in the space and to illuminate the client’s artwork without needing to use additional art lights. Two brass wall sconces are placed strategically in the living room to provide ambient light, and a statement fixture anchors the kitchen area,  illuminating across the entire length of the island. Both this and the oversized dining room pendant act as sculptural elements. Carefully placed 3-inch ceiling soffits facilitated critical adjustments in architectural lighting, including the addition of the beautiful kitchen island pendant, without sacrificing overall ceiling height. The fireplace surround and hearth were redone in slate with a minimal, painted mantel.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41912 size-full" title="entryway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">In the dining area, symmetric closets flanking the dining table replace the storage lost in the removal of the functional wall and closet bank separating the kitchen and living room. </span><span class="s1">The kitchen island is Calacatta marble with waterfall sides that give it weight despite its smallish scale; it stands as an object in the kitchen and speaks to the elliptical dining table, which has similar marble veining. </span><span class="s2">By downsizing the dishwasher, we created space for the refrigerator to move, while maintaining critical site lines throughout the apartment. The architectural moves are simple, but bring coherence to the overall plan.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The master bathroom is clad in large-format porcelain tile in light-gray veining chosen for durability and aesthetic appeal, with just enough pattern to not overwhelm the space. The bathroom is timeless and the combination with porcelain tile and minimal grout mean that it will remain pristine for years to come. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">The interior finishes and furnishings internalize the terra cottas and wrought-iron tones from the streetscape, placing the emphasis on the view beyond the windows. </span><span class="s1">The flooring throughout the apartment a light-toned wood-topped engineered floor from PID that the client chose himself. Leather-clad bar stools and a small table bring warmth to the space, while ceramics in the window lend scale to the buildings beyond.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Decades after its last reno, a prewar condo takes on a new life</h2>
<p><em>Finding the perfect apartment for one can be a challenge in New York City, let alone for a growing family that includes a 2.5-year-old, a 2-month-old, and pet, Maggie. Sometimes it takes pure luck to hit the real estate jackpot, other times, as in the case of lawyers Katherine and Chris, it takes vision. The couple’s dream home—a three-bedroom apartment in Park Slope—didn’t turn up fully renovated and as reasonably priced as they’d hoped. Instead, they landed on a two-bedroom, formerly rent-controlled unit and got creative with the design. To help see their vision through, Katherine and Chris called on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, eventually hiring a design-build firm to turn the apartment’s existing kitchen into a master bedroom, gut renovate the bath, and create the family home they’d been looking for.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40133 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-06.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><em>Guest blog post by homeowner Katherine</em></p>
<p>A 1.5-bedroom walk-up on the Upper East Side has its charms no doubt, but before the birth of our second child, the need for more space (and fewer stairs!) loomed. We had been looking in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn because one of the zoned elementary schools in the area is excellent. Chris’ parents also live in south Brooklyn and are very helpful with the kids, which was added incentive for our search. The problem is that when you’re searching in a desirable neighborhood with a desirable elementary school, good, fully-renovated three-bedroom apartments are hard to come by. And when they do crop up, they’re pretty expensive.</p>

Although it was a two-bedroom, we immediately recognized a floor plan that we could reconfigure to get the three bedrooms we needed.</p>
<p>When we checked it out, we learned that since the apartment is on the first floor and it wouldn’t disturb the upper units, we could likely move the kitchen plumbing from the back of the apartment to the front, creating an open living room-kitchen space up front and converting the former kitchen into our master bedroom. Plus, our estimated construction costs seemed doable.</p>

Essentially, the purchase price and renovation costs needed to add up to the approximate market value of a renovated three-bedroom in the area.</p>

<blockquote><p>The pantry was also our contractor&#8217;s idea; I didn’t even know that pull-out pantries existed and wasn’t sure we’d have space. But it works perfectly&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>The layout of the apartment was one thing, but there was a lot more work to be done beyond that. The apartment hadn’t been renovated in at least 30 years. The floors were warped from water damage, the hallway flooring was covered in industrial carpeting, and the kitchen floors were old linoleum. The kitchen had a lowered ceiling with crumbling tile and stains from an old flood. The walls had dozens of coats of paint layered on and there were popcorn ceilings throughout the apartment.</p>
<p>In the bathroom, fixtures were rusted, and the clawfoot tub was set up with the shower on the long wall of the tub rather than the short end. The closets and wiring also needed to be updated. Overall, we were looking for a bright, modern aesthetic but wanted to make sure that it didn’t feel cold or inconsistent with the prewar building style.</p>

Since we aren’t creative types, we definitely saw the value in hiring a firm that offered both building and design services, and we liked that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Sweeten general contractor we chose</a> not only fabricated their own cabinets but provided 3D designs so that we could visualize the finished project. That really allowed us to participate in the process.</p>
<p>Additionally, when negotiating the price and scope of the project, our contractor was very upfront with us. When we suggested certain measures that could cut costs, for example, they would tell us if they thought we would be displeased with the result, but would then suggest another area to cut costs that would be less noticeable in the finished project.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40142 size-full" title="look down a hallway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-15.jpg" alt="kitchen and hallway" width="1000" height="1498" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-15-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-15-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Creating and maximizing space was another important consideration for us throughout the renovation, and that proved particularly challenging in the kitchen, where certain kinds of storage could have easily made the space feel cramped.</p>
<p>I felt strongly that we needed a coat closet in the living room to corral entryway clutter. Originally, I had large media units with built-in storage in mind, but our Sweeten contracting team suggested extending the kitchen cabinets instead, integrating the closet that way, which looks much better than a separate media unit. The pantry was also their idea; I didn’t even know that pull-out pantries existed and wasn’t sure we’d have space. But it works perfectly and allowed use of every inch of floor-to-ceiling space in the design. Now we can put things we don’t use much up top, as well as extra supplies.</p>

We decided to build cabinets and closets around the bed to save space, rather than putting the closets opposite the bed, which would have eaten up precious floor space.</p>

We moved the tub from the side to the back wall to save space and make room for extra cabinet storage. That move required us to change the plumbing to a degree because we used the former drain from the toilet for the tub. Since there was asbestos tile in the bathroom we would have had to do an abatement if we cut a new drain for the toilet. Instead, we decided to use a wall-hung toilet, which ended up looking very streamlined and saved space, so it was a win-win.</p>

That required us to set the tub about 10 inches out from the window. Our contractors used that space to build shelves for the shower, which ended up being a beautiful design element as well. Penny tile floors added a nice tactile touch and the marble tile gives the space a luxurious look.</p>

The contractors we chose were very honest and knowledgeable and ultimately tipped the scales in their favor to win the project.</p>
<p>In the end, they delivered a more beautiful apartment than we ever could have dreamed up ourselves. And on top of it, they got it done very quickly and were lovely to work with. I’d highly recommend them.</p>

<h3>A closed-off Brooklyn kitchen with potential</h3>
<p>A beautiful neighborhood, an optimal layout, and a lot of natural light led Melissa to purchase her corner apartment in Brooklyn’s Clinton Hill Co-ops. The literary agent planned to renovate the kitchen and remove walls to take advantage of the light from the living area. Melissa also wanted to reflect the building’s mid-century style in her own space. “I wanted mid-century-Scandi-style-kitchen-meets-’70s-Italian-modern with warmer accents in the textiles and color,” she shared. Nearly 14 years after she bought her apartment, Melissa posted her renovation project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>. She was <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with a contractor</a> who helped her bring her kitchen dreams to life. The wait was worth it. (Even <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/scandinavian-white-ikea-kitchen-design-remodel-photos-266002">Apartment Therapy </a>thought so, as they covered the transformation as well!)</p>

<h3>Removing walls to create space in the kitchen</h3>
<div class="desc simple-text tt-content">
<p>Melissa worked with her interior designer, Danielle Herman of Persephone’s Spring, and a Sweeten general contractor to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establish a kitchen plan</a> and open up the space. The walls blocking the kitchen off from the living area were the first to go. Fortunately, the impact was instant: the room immediately brightened up. To take advantage of the newfound light, she chose a mix of materials, including matte <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovation-materials-shine-in-designers-full-home-reno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concrete floor and counters</a>, to balance out the stainless steel appliances. “The goal was to reflect and refract the natural light,” Melissa shared. White Ikea cabinets and floating shelves contribute to the airy and spacious look.</p>
<p>A new peninsula offers additional seating while a built-in nook holds mugs, trinkets, and books. The location of the appliances remained as-is, but without the walls, the cook space <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed a better flow</a>.</p>

He provided a detailed breakdown of the job, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget</a>, and timeline, and &#8220;stuck to it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A two-family becomes a single home for a couple and their furry friends</h2>
<p><em>Carol and Jon felt as if they’d won the lottery when they found their first home, a charming, two-story detached place—gray with black shutters, built in 1926—on the western edge of Jersey City. While Jon, a lawyer working with startups, and Carol, who does policy work for a national homelessness nonprofit, had great ideas for renovating, they knew this house would be a challenge: It was an up-down duplex and their dream was to turn it into a single-family residence. But with Sweeten&#8217;s help, the renovation turned out great—and was even featured in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/28/couple-crafts-delightful-bunny-mansion-for-their-beloved-pets/">New York Post</a>. </em></p>

<em>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Carol</em></p>
<p>This was the very first house we toured and it had everything we wanted, including a backyard, driveway, and garage. Best of all, it was around the corner from my beloved <em>tia</em> (Spanish for &#8220;aunt&#8221;), so we can have coffee with her every day. We loved our home, but there were challenges: the electrical had to be upgraded and we had to move radiators around to accommodate the kitchen renovation.</p>

<p>With the ultimate goal to make two spaces into one cohesive home, we knew we’d need to save money. So when we first moved in, we made just a few aesthetic changes. We painted the entire space, including the kitchen cabinets, and we had a family friend remove not one, but two drop ceilings in the kitchen. We added a few new light fixtures and fabulous bunny wallpaper from Anthropologie.</p>
<p>We decided to play the role of landlord, living on the first floor of the house with our four rabbits and three cats while we <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/renovate-your-rental-property-wisely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rented out the top floor</a>. We knew that the renovation process would take time, money and patience, but that it would be worth it.</p>

<p>After two years of saving, we were ready to take on the full renovation. We browsed Sweeten&#8217;s Instagram page for inspiration, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27631" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten,</a> and were matched with an amazing contractor. He really helped this not-so-handy couple transform our kitchen into the perfect space to cook and entertain, and prepare the rest of the house for the next renovation phase: turning the house from a double to a single-family home.</p>
<p>During the renovation, we moved into the upstairs unit and lived without a stove with our seven pets, as well as a cat and her two kittens we were fostering for JerseyCats, a local cat rescue. We weren&#8217;t prepared for the renovation to take as long as it did. We started demolition at the end of March and finished early August. Waiting for permits held stuff up a lot. We were sort of over the whole process very quickly. Fortunately, our contractor was always there to help.</p>

Have I mentioned the bunny wallpaper? Early in our relationship, Jon was in law school and I was in graduate school. We thought bunnies would be low-maintenance pets. HA! Now, we can&#8217;t get enough.</p>
<p>We also wanted to increase storage and counter space and create direct access to the backyard through the kitchen.</p>

<p>To enlarge the kitchen, we tore down a wall and took space from an existing bedroom. One of my must-haves was a big kitchen island. I love to cook and host parties for my friends and family, and everyone always ends up in the kitchen. I kept imagining a huge island surrounded by those I love. I really wanted it to be different and for the cabinets underneath (and the lower perimeter cabinets) to be colorful. I&#8217;ve been going through a green phase. I came across swatches of Benjamin Moore Pine Green and was immediately inspired. I’ll admit, I&#8217;m obsessed with the island.</p>

The contractor also created a new door out of an existing window that allowed direct access to the backyard. For more storage, he came up with the double-door pantry, knowing I wanted enough space for my microwave and all of my cooking appliances.</p>

He took charge of redesigning the entry foyer and exposing an existing staircase, which had been hidden behind a wall. Removing that wall and adding a banister made the two-family feel disappear. We are now able to go upstairs without having to go through the foyer.</p>

It&#8217;s such an old house that the panel is in the back of the house, so upgrading it entirely would have been a much larger endeavor.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the renovation was seeing the space transform day to day. One of my favorite moments was walking in and seeing the kitchen gutted to its frame. It was hard to even imagine how beautiful it would turn out. It was exciting and surreal. Despite the delays and being (slightly) over budget, we are in love with our home and would go through it all again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>For two Brooklyn grandparents with aging-in-place plans, a layout change turns their co-op into an oasis</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35016 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-07-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, kitchen renovation, open layout, Brooklyn grandparents renovate" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marie and John are both NYC natives who had lived in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. for many years. When their first grandchild was born in Brooklyn in 2014, they began plotting the move back to their hometown. After John retired in 2017, the couple decided to buy a home that would accommodate large gatherings with their friends, five children, and the growing number of grandkids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35478 size-chrono" title="Marie and John" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-22-723x482.jpg" alt="Marie and John, Brooklyn grandparents, home renovation, home, design construction" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35017 size-chrono" title="floor plan " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-Floorplan-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, kitchen renovation, open layout" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35019 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, living room, open layout" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a four-month search with unsuccessful bids on two other properties, Marie and John visited an open house in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn. “Even though it was a very wet, snowy day in early 2017, there were many potential buyers,” Marie said. &#8220;We both liked the size and layout and could see great potential in the space. There were 12 large windows with three exposures, which won us over. We ended up paying over asking price, but were satisfied with the deal.” The 3-bed, 1.5-bath co-op boasted about 1,300 square feet of living space and was close to Prospect Park as well as their children. The closing occurred in May; the couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned to Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found a Sweeten architect</a> to help with a thorough renovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-BEFORE-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35024 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-BEFORE-01-723x933.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, living room, design, renovation, open layout" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35021 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, living room, design, renovation, open layout" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although serviceable, the apartment needed some TLC in terms of remodeling the kitchen, bathroom, and converting an existing half-bath into a master bath with a shower. They also wanted to open up the space so that the three exposures could bring light into every corner of the apartment. The conversation with their Sweeten architect resulted in architectural renderings, which planned the space as an &#8220;age-in-place oasis&#8221; for the active couple who wanted the convenience and amenities of city living while also being able to host a large extended family.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-05.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35023 size-chrono" title="french doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-05.gif" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, french doors, sliding doors, living room" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35022 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, living room, design, open layout" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To accommodate the couple’s desire to age in place and ultimately remain in the apartment as long as possible, their architect added accessible design features in the bathrooms. Materials and design were also implemented for easy maintenance, such as closets to keep spaces clutter-free, large-scale bath ceramic tile that required less grout, and moisture- and heat-resistant Caesarstone kitchen countertops.</p>

</a>(<em>Befores above</em>) Dining room cabinets replaced the closets (l.); kitchen entry located to the right. The wall was removed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the common spaces, a reconfigured layout maximized the open space for entertaining and cooking. A windowed den was previously accessible through the kitchen, but a reorientation connected it to the living room, which made more sense. The den could double as a guest room when necessary but would serve as a corner office on a daily basis. The pocket doors, which created an opening of six feet, could be left open so that more natural light entered the living room.</p>

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35028 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-13-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, kitchen renovation, open layout" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35030 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-16-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, kitchen renovation, open layout" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen, which previously had a tile floor, was re-laid with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardwood</a> to match that in the living room. The new continuous flooring helped unify the now open-plan living area. “Our new kitchen was outfitted with gray IKEA Bodbyn cabinets and glossy deep crimson glass tiles for the backsplash. It’s the extra special spark to our gray kitchen,” Marie said. The tall upper cabinets take advantage of the high ceiling and provide extra storage space. &#8220;Based on our own past experience, we chose quartz countertops,&#8221; she added. &#8220;The fact that it is practically indestructible met our desire for a low-maintenance lifestyle.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The demolition of a wall between the kitchen and the dining alcove transformed the previously dark space into a brightly lit and well-integrated dining area. Their Sweeten architect also replaced the existing closets at the back of the dining space with additional cabinetry that matched the kitchen. Upper cabinets were faced with glass and a mirrored backsplash which the homeowners loved. A spherical chandelier in bronze was hung above the dining table as a statement piece.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-BEFORE-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35035 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-BEFORE-08-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, bathroom renovation, before" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35033 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19-723x1085.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, bathroom renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next major transformation was in the master bath, which was originally a powder room (they planned to borrowed square footage from a second bedroom). The tiny space had no room for a shower, which the homeowners wanted, so the architect embarked on an arduous process of convincing the co-op board that increasing the footprint of the bathroom, which involved creating wet-over-dry conditions (something that’s usually a no-no for co-ops), would not be a problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35032 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-20-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, bathroom, renovation, shower, toilet, Brooklyn grandparents" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to allay the concerns of the board, the architect met with the board and building engineer to go over all of the precautions that would be taken as well as the materials that were chosen and installation methods. The result of their architect&#8217;s perseverance: excellent water- and sound-proofing so that neighboring apartments would not be affected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They chose light-colored <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tile for the floors</a> and walls, with accent tiles for the shower floor and niche. The design included a long safety bar inside the shower for more stability when showering—one of the features that would accommodate Marie and John as they age. A large square sink from Duravit sits on a stand with modern lines and one shelf below.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-BEFORE-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35034 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-BEFORE-07-723x482.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, bathroom renovation, before, Brooklyn grandparents" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35036 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-17-723x1085.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, bathroom renovation, floating vanity, bathtub, Brooklyn grandparents" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The guest bath featured a large mirror with a stone shelf beneath and lighter colors. Safety handlebars were also added to the inside of the bathtub wall. For easy cleaning and to free up the floor space, wall-hung sinks were installed. “This bathroom has no window, but looks bright, large, and attractive,” Marie said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-18-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35343 mb-0 size-chrono" title="shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-18-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="Kensington, Brooklyn, home renovation, bathroom renovation, shower head, shower, Brooklyn grandparents" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation was a true collaboration between the homeowners and the architect. Marie explained, “Our Sweeten architect was extremely helpful, making suggestions, listening to our opinions and helping us decide. She seemed to be totally invested while following our tastes and budget.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How do they feel about their new home? “Our new space feels comfortable and cozy,&#8221; Marie said. &#8220;The natural light combined with our light fixtures make it a happy place to live. We feel very much at home&#8230;like we have been here for a long time.”</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Marie and John. We hope you’ll have many happy family gatherings in your new home!</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ana and Leo survived the complex process of selling their old apartment and buying a new one simultaneously—no easy feat!—but were nearly taken by an unscrupulous contractor when it came time to renovate. They realized that they needed someone they could trust to facilitate the search for general contractors and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors—</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">turned out to be exactly what they were looking for. (Their words, not ours!) Their Sweeten contractor helped them make layout changes and took on the challenge of creating an oversized sliding door system that allowed the conversion of an open office space into a private guest suite. Here&#8217;s how the couple transformed their Tribeca apartment from an awkward warren of rooms into an open, flexible space that is both comfortable and refined, including redoing the living room, office/guest room, dining space, bedroom, and of course the kitchen and two bathrooms.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Every real estate agent told us it could not be done. That, in New York, it was nearly impossible to coordinate the sale of our current apartment with the purchase of a new one. But my husband, Leo, was determined, so that is what we set out to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a long search and many disappointments, including lost bid wars and a contract that fell through, fate brought us an amazing real estate broker who made it all possible. <a href="https://www.kristiambrosetti.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristi Ambrosetti</a> was not fazed by the sell-buy challenge and helped us find our new home and sell our old one.</p>
<p>The apartment met all of our requirements—a 1,000-square-foot, 2-bed, 2-bath in a doorman building in Tribeca, with great light and plenty of storage space. The interior, however, was still in its original condition from the &#8217;80s; it needed a complete renovation to update finishes and fix layout issues that made the space feel choppy and awkward—the exact opposite of the contemporary open space we had hoped for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being an architect, I developed the initial plans for the renovation and met with several general contractors that claimed to be available for the job. After <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comparing multiple bids</a>, we were close to signing with one of them but decided to do some background checking first. I was shocked to find that the address listed in their documents was actually an empty storefront in Queens. The thought that we were very close to making a substantial down payment with someone that might not show up for the job really scared us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At that point, we took the search for general contractors online and came across Sweeten. We read about their screening process to find qualified professionals, and it sounded exactly like what we were looking for, so we decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg5YkmLFz4a5xkDfbtxLMvC7WWzQ">post our project</a>. From the beginning, the experience was surprisingly straightforward. Posting on the website was easy and we were soon matched with a few professionals. When we started interviewing potential general contractors, we were contacted by Miranda from Sweeten and she helped us through the whole process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the weeks we had spent interviewing general contractors, we also focused on finalizing the layout and decisions on finishes and fixtures. By the time we signed with our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDUErsavPF6GS1QXwyFWAiekS7sA">chosen Sweeten contractor</a>, we were ready to begin demolition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leo and I had been a little apprehensive about some of our design choices, especially when it came to the changes in the layout, which were intended to make the space more open and flexible. But when demolition began, it became clear that we were on the right track.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening up the kitchen</a>, the contractor also eliminated a narrow wall that partially blocked the entryway and made for a very awkward hallway. Squaring off the angled wall between the living room and the master bedroom made both spaces a lot more pleasant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The change that made the most impact, though, was opening the office (which would double as a guest suite) into the living room. Oversized <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding panels</a> would allow the room to be closed off and provide privacy for overnight guests. However, most of the professionals we spoke to thought the panels would be too heavy and could not be done. The Sweeten contracting team accepted the challenge and executed them beautifully.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The one setback we had during demolition was an unexpected electrical conduit found in one of the living room walls we had planned to demolish. The conduit ran down to the apartment below ours and, therefore, could not be moved. After conversations with the contractor, Leo and I decided to take down the rest of the wall as originally planned and leave only the section that had the conduit, creating a corner niche that was perfect for a bookshelf. Once the renovation was complete, this turned out to be one of our favorite features in the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One aspect that had drawn us to the apartment was a nook next to the living room that seemed perfect for a small bar. Early in the project, we pulled inspiration photos online and it seemed like designing the bar would be fairly easy. That was until we decided the bar should also house a concealed 40-inch TV, which then led to weeks of research and multiple drawing iterations until we landed on a design that met all of our functional requirements for both the bar and the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dining room pendants were another big challenge. The position of the existing light did not align with the center of the dining table, and we were not able to move the light because of the concrete ceiling. I had almost given up on having pendants over the table when Leo came across the Swell String fixture, which allowed for the pendants to be installed in any position, independent of the canopy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The finishes for the bathrooms and kitchen were also much debated. We knew from the beginning we wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble tile</a> in the bathrooms but looked at a wide range of patterns, sizes, and prices. Narrowing down the search to neutral tones and classic patterns, I eventually chose an Asian statuary from TileBar for the master bathroom and a Bardiglio herringbone mosaic for the guest bathroom floor, with the same Asian statuary in the shower. As a contrast to the traditional tile, I selected modern Duravit fixtures and Grohe faucets. The towel warmers had been at the top of our wishlist and after much research, we were able to find a small hardwired option that worked well in both bathrooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25010 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="general contractors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25008 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04.jpg" alt="general contractors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For our small <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">galley kitchen</a>, we chose the same low-maintenance quartz countertops we had in our previous apartment, paired with white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinets</a> and integrated Bosch appliances. The cabinets were finished with black linear pulls with accent walnut shelves added on the back wall for some extra storage. The backsplash was probably one of the toughest decisions—with so many interesting materials and patterns to choose from, we considered all sorts of options, from large back-painted glass panels to intricate mosaics. As a way to balance the modern cabinets and countertops, we decided on marble subway tile from TileBar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our main goals for the master bedroom were to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/bedroom-storage-style-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximize storage</a> and improve circulation. So the swing bedroom door was replaced with a pocket door, improving access to a long wall of closets that ended in a small custom-made vanity at the corner of the room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Leo and I found that all the time spent obsessing over the small details really paid off—it all came together as we had hoped and we were very happy, not only with our choices but with the quality of execution and expertise the Sweeten contractor and his team brought to the project. Most importantly, knowing Sweeten was following the project, and touching base with us periodically gave us peace of mind through the whole process.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When shopping for Manhattan real estate, you don’t always get what you want. For Gall, a patent attorney who grew up in Florida, an extended search for a new Manhattan apartment took him and his wife first across town, into an unexpected neighborhood, and subsequently through an impressive renovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23270 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-723x487.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="487" /></a><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gall was living in a Hell’s Kitchen one-bedroom with his wife Ingrid, a Brazilian-born speech pathologist. They initially discovered <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> when they began thinking about a renovation for that apartment. The makeover wasn’t to be, however, and they switched gears in anticipation of expanding their family. For the better part of a year, the couple shopped for a larger apartment in the competitive market along Broadway on the Upper West Side. It was only after widening their search across Central Park that they stumbled onto an affordable Upper East Side building “right on top of the subway,” he notes.<br />
</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23267 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan-543x668.jpg" alt="floorplan" width="543" height="668" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23269 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01-1-720x495.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01" width="720" height="495" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23263 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high-rise building was originally developed as a rental in the 1980’s, and Gall liked the way its bay windows amplified the view. The 1,280-square-foot unit had received mainly cosmetic renovations since going condo in the early 2000’s, so floors were a deep brown that showed dust and failed to bounce natural light around the space. The original kitchen measured 100 square feet, but felt cramped and closed-off, with a shortage of counter space. Gall, who is the family chef, recalls the well-used beige plastic laminate kitchen cabinets as being very small, and they didn’t go all the way to the ceiling. There was also insufficient storage in the bedrooms. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where they fit their clothes,&#8221; he says.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23381 size-chrono" title="Upper East Side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23272 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, it was a real estate broker’s recommendation which reminded Gall of Sweeten. He <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their remodel</a>, along with a wish list of some elements to add and others to subtract. After signing with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> that offered design and build services in April, demolition began in June. Their contractor worked with the couple for months, strategically updating the apartment while enhancing the expanses of space that had attracted them in the first place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One early target was a wide bank of awkwardly placed bui</span>lt-in bookcases ri<span style="font-weight: 400;">ght at the entrance. “It had tons of little compartments and really felt cluttered right there in the middle of the house,” Gall explains. They removed it and worked with their team to fill the same space with closed storage. A penthouse they saw while apartment shopping served as the couple’s design inspiration for cool mirror doors—on both their new pantry cabinet and the neighboring linen closet—that are decorated with a retro raised-panel design.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One unexpected (and technically challenging) concern was mentioned by the building architect. For the spot where they planned to open up the kitchen by demolishing a wall, the architect asked about a much discussed but often ignored code requirement for a drop soffit to channel smoke dividing the ceiling between the kitchen and living area. A reworked soffit satisfied the requirement and tied into the other new ones around the living room. To unify the apartment throughout, their contractor suggested </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they see an example of 5-inch-wide white oak floors in another project the team had completed; Gall and Ingrid instantly fell in love. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wood was glued down to the concrete subfloor throughout the living areas, and even in the kitchen. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23382 size-chrono" title="Upper East Side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23276 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23277 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span>he new kitchen has synthetic quartz for the countertops, as well as on the new island where the wall<span style="font-weight: 400;"> once stood. “By opening up the wall we lost a lot of upper cabinet space,” he explains, which made new full-height cabinets a necessity. The cabinets are white-painted maple, and the backsplash mosaic is a herringbone composed of glass and marble tiles. The couple skipped a range in favor of the flexibility of having a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-ovens-power-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall oven</a> and separate <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooktop</a>. The refrigerator, though not a pricey panel-ready model, is neatly integrated into a tall wall of white cabinetry. The cookspace was one of their favorite spaces. &#8220;The craftsmanship was amazing,&#8221; said Gall. &#8220;The huge countertop makes working in the kitchen a pleasant experience,&#8221; including enough space for him and his wife to cook together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In t</span>he master bathroom, <span style="font-weight: 400;">a tub was replaced with a new stand-up shower with marble from Porcelanosa. Gall praises the three-dimensional renderings created by his Sweeten contractor, which were a great help for imagining the look of the kitchen. “We’re not visual people, and that made the process much smoother and easier.” </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The closet organization in the master bedroom was built to the homeowners&#8217; exact requests, not only providing more than adequate storage, but the cabinet doors matched the rest found in the apartment. For the nursery, the initial placement allowed the rest of the room to be furnished around it. &#8220;The closet was planned to accommodate two children at different ages,&#8221; says Gall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23350 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Upper east side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1-723x1058.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1058" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of the inconveniences, Sweeten clearly contributed immeasurably to the couple’s renovation. “We had been very nervous about getting the right contractor, one who wouldn’t walk out on us,” he recalls. He advises renovators to expect a longer period of construction than originally quoted, and to spend as much of your own energy on it as possible. Once you find an expert you can count on, he says, &#8220;trust your contractor&#8217;s opinion.&#8221; Mid-construction, they found out they were expecting a child, and the job was finished before the birth. Today, one of those spectacular bay windows in the living room, with its classic New York view, makes an ideal playpen for the luckiest of big-city babies.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>She decided to renovate instead of move</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>With prices in her Fort Greene co-op building surging upward, film editor Mollie Goldstein faced a dilemma: she could cash out (but deal with the colossal hassle of moving) or remain in a building and neighborhood she loved (albeit in an outdated “starter” studio apartment). Some smart home equity math helped her see that the pros of her current place outweighed the cons, so she came to Sweeten to upgrade (inventively and colorfully!) rather than start again elsewhere.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39994 mb-0 size-full" title="blue kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="blue kitchen" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by Fort Greene homeowner Mollie Goldstein</em></p>
<p>About a year ago, I started noticing that prices for apartments in my Fort Greene co-op building had skyrocketed. I live in a studio, so the question of upgrading to a true one-bedroom was always on my mind. It had also been ten years since I bought my 500 square foot “starter apartment,” so I was starting to wonder if it might be time for a more “grown-up” dwelling. In short: Was now the time to cash out and buy something bigger elsewhere?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon consideration, though, I realized that 1) I love my building, 2) I love my neighborhood, and 3) my apartment is the exact right size for one person and one dog. The increasing market value, however, meant that I had equity I could borrow against, and so I decided to renovate the kitchen and bathroom and make myself a new apartment without having to uproot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39988 size-full" title="kitchen before renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39989 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom before renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04.jpg" alt="bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That decision turned out to be the easy part. When it came to planning a renovation—or even finding someone to help me plan a renovation—I had no idea what I was doing and no clue how to get started. After some time on the Internet, I thought a design/build firm might make the most sense for me, since I had no confidence in my ability to either design a proper space or supervise a contractor. But when I talked to the reps for several Manhattan firms, they laughed at my budget and sent me packing. Google eventually led me to Sweeten, where I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a>. The kind staff there double-checked my budget, but at least they didn’t laugh—and neither did the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a> I was eventually paired up with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She was amazing, and I felt an instant rapport with her. I’d had no experience in construction, but I do collaborate for a living (I’m a film editor), and I immediately recognized that she was a gem. The design process was so much fun. Because I was renovating in order to stay put, I wanted to design spaces purely for myself. Both rooms had always been serviceable, but the hasty repairs made before I moved in ten years earlier were showing their age, and I knew there had to be better ways to take advantage of the space I had available (especially in the surprisingly large-for-NYC kitchen). It drove me crazy that the kitchen cabinets didn&#8217;t reach the ceiling (so much wasted space!) and I hated stacking my spices on top of the stove. I also had a random hole in my kitchen wall where a neighbor&#8217;s contractor had drilled through and then disappeared. The bathroom was grungy in its off-white color scheme and constantly sprouting various leaks and cracks. I also love pattern and color, and I knew I wanted to create a personalized kitchen and something other than a standard white bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39996 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39994 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39995 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen desk niche" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="kitchen desk niche" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen design came together very quickly. I gave my contractor a few wallpaper swatches and a random list of priorities: I wanted a dishwasher, but it had to be less obtrusive than the current model; I needed a place for cookbooks; I was desperate for more storage; and could she please include a cute little spice drawer? Within a few days she sent me a rendering that was very similar to the final product. The Hygge &amp; West wallpaper (which I’d had my eye on for a while), set the tone for our color scheme and she designed a clever built-in with a hidden-drawer dishwasher by Fisher &amp; Paykel that I loved right away.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The basic layout of the bathroom was pretty easy, too, but we struggled a little more with the design. I knew I wanted something special, but I didn’t exactly know what it was. I sent my contractor a list of tiles I liked, none of which were appropriate, but she looked at them all and distilled the essence of what I was looking for, sending back the chevron marble from TileBar that we eventually went with around the tub (with its hexagon cousin for the floor). And as it happened, one of those other rejected bathroom tiles ended up as the kitchen floor — when we were looking at all our samples together, I slid that Bestile Moderna sample over to the kitchen pile, and, while neither of us had seen it coming, we both loved the black &amp; white pattern against the blue cabinetry. The floor has since become one of my absolute favorite things about the kitchen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to my contactor and her team, construction went pretty smoothly (for me). I moved out for five weeks while they dealt with all the problems of a crumbling kitchen ceiling, hauling debris out through a co-op lobby, and having to send back tile that arrived scratched. I’m sure there were a hundred other stumbling blocks that I never heard about, and I remain deeply grateful for the opportunity to work with trustworthy contractors whose standards were even higher than I expected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Maggie (my dog) and I have moved back in, I’m in love with my new space. Showering in my beautiful marble shower every morning is a treat, and I cook much more—and much more enjoyably—now that I have all the counter space I need. Both the kitchen and the bathroom are neater and less cluttered than ever before now that there is a place to put everything. I’m incredibly happy that I took the renovation plunge.</p>
