<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Give a generic Jersey City kitchen a modern-industrial twist</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Every kitchen in a pencil-factory-turned-apartment complex in Jersey City, New Jersey, had the same look: brown cabinets, tan tiles, and black countertops. But homeowners Becky and Paul (and their two cats), who’d been living in their two-bedroom apartment almost three years, wanted their cook space to stand out. Their 120-square-foot galley kitchen had a workable layout and thanks to a look-through window, was also connected to the living space. It just needed a refresh of the fixtures and materials, plus more storage. The couple </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30876" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sweeten and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4260" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40861" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The first-time renovators got to work with their general contractor to select materials and appliances.  “If we chose something he thought from a professional standpoint wouldn’t work, he would not only explain why but have alternative options for us to review,” they shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were aiming for a bright and airy look with touches of industrial elements to align with their building style, which they achieved with white cabinets, a glossy backsplash, and pops of stainless steel in the faucet and farmhouse sink. The blue wall makes the room appear bigger and lighter, too.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40867 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="653" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05-300x196.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05-600x392.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wood-like tile floor (a growing trend in kitchen upgrades), floating wood shelves, and a corner of butcher block countertop add a natural appeal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the kitchen’s coolest new features: a built-in wine rack just above the sink that takes advantage of what would otherwise be empty space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong communication between the contractor and homeowners contributed to the successful completion of the project. If issues cropped up, like delayed deliveries, that would affect timing or cost, the contractor contacted the homeowners right away and found solutions quickly. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a newbie in renovation, this level of communication and education was greatly appreciated. He was also such a champion for us when ordering materials and always put his clients&#8217; needs first when working with vendors,” they shared. The renovators didn’t run into any major issues, though their friendly cats did try to lend a paw throughout the process. On workdays, Becky and Paul set them up in their bedroom to keep them out of the construction zone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten Client Services also just checked in throughout the project to make sure the process was going smoothly. “We could not be more grateful to have such a terrific support system,&#8221; they shared.</span></p>

<h3>Injecting natural light into a Jersey City kitchen</h3>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Improve the layout and look of a drab Jersey City kitchen</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: Anne wanted to wait to move into her Jersey City co-op apartment until she renovated the kitchen. After six years of renting, she bought the apartment knowing it would need some work. “I saw 35 finished apartments that just were not ‘me,’ so I was very open to the idea of purchasing a place that needed a little work to make it my own,” she said. Having grown up with a family very comfortable with renovations, Anne was more than ready to take on a project. On her wish list? A kitchen layout optimized for cooking, with plenty of natural light and a mix of traditional and modern details. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/29534">posted her project on Sweeten</a> and after considering her matches chose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4260">Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37363 size-full" title="anne-posing-in-her-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="anne standing in her kitchen after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37357 mb-0 size-full" title="two-kitchen-images-before-renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" alt="two images of kitchen with maple cabinets and black countertop with undermount stainless steel sink and white appliances and square tiles on floor before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: In order to make the best use of the small space, a wall with a cut-out into the living room (and that housed appliances) came down. Knocking it down allowed more light to come into the living room from the window over the sink. Otherwise, the footprint remained the same, with the kitchen sink and dishwasher on one wall, the stove on another.</p>
<p>The builder-grade cabinets were swapped with white shaker cabinets, adding the traditional touch Anne was aiming for. “I picked tall cabinets that went all the way up to the ceiling, and my contractor installed trim at the top to make them look custom,” she said. A classic subway tile backsplash and quartz countertops tied the whole look together. New hardwood flooring in both the kitchen and living area united the space.</p>
<p>A few roadblocks came up during the project, such as outdated electrical and plumbing, but Anne’s contractor handled it all—without delaying the estimated completion time. “The biggest thing that was important for me was to have a timeline that worked. My rental lease was up and I needed a place to live,” she said. Anne was able to move in right on time and start enjoying her new kitchen. Selecting the new cabinets and counters was her favorite part of the process, as was seeing it come together over the weeks of renovation. “It’s extremely rewarding to see how great everything turned out and having your own space that is exactly how you would want it!&#8221;</p>

<h3>A dire kitchen storage situation is resolved</h3>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Add more storage and bring a kitchen up to date</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: Kate and Matt loved Jersey City and their home, but were more than ready to refresh their kitchen. Cheap ‘80s-era cabinets were showing their age and the storage situation was dire. The galley set-up also limited their options to expand and create a more cook-friendly space. Kate’s main ask, besides a completely new look, was a breakfast bar. “I spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking,” she said, “so I really craved a little spot in which to sit.” <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19777">She posted her project on Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3189">chose her Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="beige-kitchen-cabinets-white-countertop"  class="alignnone wp-image-30957 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02.jpg" alt="beige kitchen cabinets and white countertop in a kitchen with brown floor before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Luckily, the galley layout proved less of an obstacle than anticipated. She worked with her Sweeten contractor, settling on a built-in breakfast bar at the far end of the kitchen, just above the stairs. The couple worried about the potential for things to fall of the ledge to the floor below, but their contractor&#8217;s recommendation of a raised back on the bar eliminated their concern.</p>
<p>The good fortune continued, as they discovered during demolition the soffits that were taking up valuable wall space were empty. They were removed, and taller upper cabinets installed. To make the galley kitchen feel brighter, the couple chose light materials for the countertops and backsplash to counteract the new gray cabinets.  Their contractor also moved the refrigerator and dishwasher, optimizing the layout for more storage options.</p>
