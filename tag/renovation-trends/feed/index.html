			<h2 class="p1">Move over, beige. Mint green, sage, and celadon are delighting kitchens.</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-50800 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18.jpg" alt="light green kitchen cabinets with white countertop and black steel gas cooking range with hood and undermount sink with brushed nickel faucet and white walls after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Just right for a touch of color</h3>
<p class="p1">Finding light green in the home is a natural choice. The shade is so closely aligned with plants, trees, and the fresh outdoor air that it’s no wonder it brings comfort. We’ve been seeing light green kitchen cabinets—from mint green to light pistachio—remain popular over time earning their place as a dependable, go-to neutral.</p>
<p>Here, examples of how Sweeten homeowners are bringing this kitchen design trend to life.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3>From builder-grade to sage green farmhouse cabinets</h3>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="sage green cabinets and white kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56345" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Even though Abby’s building was newly-built, the builder-grade materials found in her kitchen weren’t feeling like home to her. In particular, she didn’t like the dark green cabinets but preferred a lighter, airier version of the color. The design she wanted was a farmhouse look for <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/sage-green-kitchen-sets-up-a-country-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her kitchen remodel</a>. Her Sweeten contractor worked with a subcontractor to custom-make Shaker-style cabinets.</p>
<p class="p1">“I had been thinking about green kitchen cabinets for a long time,” she said. “Sage green kitchen cabinets have color but are a tone that isn’t overwhelming.” Black fixtures and walnut shelves complemented the sage green.</p>
<h3>Light green kitchen cabinets in verdigris</h3>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18.jpg" alt="light green kitchen cabinets with white countertop and black steel gas cooking range with hood and undermount sink with brushed nickel faucet and white walls after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">The Sweeten homeowners of this 1882 Bronx rowhouse were Steve, a professor at the School of Visual Arts, and Lewis, a tax professional. Each floor would be made into an open concept, which required a true <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-bronx-rowhouse-remodel-for-work-life-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">townhouse gut renovation</a>. Everything was demolished down to the brick and joists.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The couple aimed for a design aesthetic of warm minimalism. Located on the middle level with the living and dining rooms, the kitchen cabinets were custom-built. The modern, flat-front panels were painted a hue that was of the palest verdigris. To create a unified look with other spaces in the home, the master bathroom upstairs also featured this color family in yellow-greens and gray-greens.</p>
<h3>A galley kitchen in mint-green</h3>

<p>Laura and Tim lived in their 1929 brick townhouse in Rego Park, Queens, for many years before deciding to renovate. They loved their home. However, it became what Laura called “grungy and old.&#8221; The kitchen had been damaged by a leaky shower from the bathroom above and needed new cabinets, flooring, and wall treatments.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-patio-house-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">couple turned to Sweeten for the overhaul</a>. Their contractor enclosed an outdoor patio connecting it to the back of the kitchen. With the introduction of skylights and a new color palette, the kitchen became a cheerful space for the family to gather.</p>
<p>Laura and Tim selected Shaker-style cabinet fronts in mint green. The hue “matches the feel of the old house but is also clean and modern at the same time,” said Laura. Moreover, the brushed bronze hardware and stainless-steel appliances provide a nice contrast. “The kitchen came out beautifully,” Laura said.</p>
<h3>Light green kitchen cabinets include agave</h3>

<p>Two years after buying their two-bedroom apartment in Queens, Gina and Andrew decided to renovate. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">couple wanted to fix the kitchen&#8217;s</a> small, awkward layout and create a space that would inspire them to cook.</p>
<p>The pair was inspired by the lovely mix of greens in their co-op courtyard. To bring this into their design, they chose beautiful lower cabinets in the shade of agave. Warm brass hardware stands out against the more muted green cabinets. “I never used to cook and after our renovation, I’m cooking up a storm,” said Andrew.</p>

<h3>Two designers compromise on color</h3>

<a href='https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/attachment/sweeten-maggierossadam-spiegel-apt-01/'><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-01.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="kitchen renovation, two-tone cabinets, gold hardware" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-01-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>
<a href='https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/attachment/sweeten-maggierossadam-spiegel-apt-02/'><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-02.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="home renovation, kitchen renovation, open floor plan" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>

<p>Design is definitely in this couple’s wheelhouse. An interior designer and former architect, respectively, Maggie and Adam knew that they would have to make some <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">concessions when designing their own co-op</a>. Their focus: the kitchen.</p>
<p>Their kitchen was small and outdated. Luckily, they were able to make it much larger by removing the surrounding wall, changing the location of the refrigerator, and adding shelves instead of upper cabinets.</p>
<p>According to the Sweeten couple, the kitchen really revealed the way they communicated. “The kitchen shows the full-scale of compromise between our distinct design ideas,” said Adam. “For instance, the light green lower cabinets add the layer of color that fit her style, but have a gray tone that doesn’t stray from my own style.”</p>
<p>It was important to Maggie to “add a personal touch, warmth, and texture to the kitchen,&#8221; which they achieved through the mint-green cabinetry—a style that is classic yet contemporary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Sweeten&#8217;s top 10 reno trends we predict will continue strong</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-Trends-Graphic-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33607 mb-0 size-chrono" title="home design trends for 2018" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-Trends-Graphic-1-723x723.jpg" alt="home design trends for 2018" width="723" height="723" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovators this year embraced trends new and old, from fresh takes to a more classic approach. Read on to see what made the cut.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sliding-Doors.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29449 size-chrono" title="white-barn-door-brick-wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sliding-Doors.gif" alt="white barn door near brick wall and large window and brown floor tiles after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>SLIDING DOORS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A door can be more than just an entry from one room to another; it can take an open plan apartment and turn it into multiple, private spaces. Sliding doors add flexibility to spaces of all sizes, making rooms magically appear as if out of thin air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/">Miguel</a> got rid of a wall of closets and relocated the storage to the bedroom, installing a wardrobe on rollers that could also function as a door; glass-paneled partitions allowed <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/queens-condo-overhaul-begins-with-kitchen-sink/">Sarah and Craig</a> to create a second bedroom in their apartment without blocking the light from a wall of windows; to transition their office into a guest bedroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/general-contractors-dream-apartment/">Ana and Leo</a> opted for a set of white, sliding doors that have the appearance of a solid wall when closed.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Walls-Turned-Peninsula.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29453 size-chrono" title="walls turned into peninsulas" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Walls-Turned-Peninsula.gif" alt="walls turned into peninsulas" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>WALLS-TURNED-PENINSULA</h3>
<p>“Where there’s a wall, there’s a way” isn’t technically a saying, but it works well to describe how homeowners have been opening up their kitchens by chopping a wall in half. The move makes your kitchen feel much larger and boosts prep, storage, and dining space.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-becomes-a-workflow-masterpiece/">Lisa and Chris’</a> tiny kitchen, the close walls made it feel tight and restricted—until they turned one wall into a peninsula; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/before-after-kaija-and-johns-prospect-heights-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/">Kaija and John</a> did the same in their space and topped it with a poured concrete countertop; and so did <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/">Dan and Mike</a>, adding stylish wood paneling for a touch of contrast.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Multi-Comfort-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29469 size-chrono" title="gray-bedroom-blue-bedcover" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Multi-Comfort-2.gif" alt="gray bedroom with blue bedcover and gray fireplace after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>MULTI-COMFORT</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(Air quality/Soundproofing)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes, the most comfortable elements of your home are the least noticeable, like air conditioning that keeps the summer heat at bay or soundproofing that elevates the coziness factor in bedrooms. When you’re thinking of new features to add to your home, like hardwood flooring or a marble countertop, don’t forget to make comfort a priority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new HVAC system found a spot at the top of the renovation checklist in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry&#8217;s</a> 130-year-old brownstone; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/deniz-ramons-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deniz and Ramon</a> added soundproofing to two walls in their kitchen to prevent noise from leaking into the bedroom; and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/original-details-brooklyn-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah</a> chose solid core doors for the nursery so her girls can snooze away while she entertains right outside their door.<b><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-29446 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Wall-Hung-Toilet.gif" alt="Wall-Hung-Toilet" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>WALL-HUNG TOILETS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The toilet may not be the prettiest feature, but no bathroom is complete without one. When it comes to selecting one for your space, wall-hung toilets have a lot going for them, from the nearly non-existent footprint to the ease of cleaning below and around the unit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-gets-a-nordic-look-for-bathrooms-and-closets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Felix’s</a> Scandinavian-styled powder room, the wall-hung toilet blends in seamlessly with her minimal design; the unit in <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alicia and Ed’s</a> downstairs bathroom fades into the background so that the classic trough sink can take center stage; and in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/bathroom-remodel-injects-personality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meredith and Jason’s</a> small master bath, the toilet takes up very little room, allowing them to gain back seven inches of floor space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Skim-Coating.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29448 size-chrono" title="white-open-book-shelf-large-window" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Skim-Coating.gif" alt="white open book shelf near large window and breakfast nook with white round table and brown wooden floor after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>SKIM COATING</h3>
<p>Although the process costs more than a simple color change, skim coating greatly improves the appearance of walls. Think of it as stretching a fresh piece of canvas for your masterpiece instead of painting on top of an older artwork.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-bookcases-prewar-home/">Cat and Jordan</a> took this extra step to reach the goal of making their apartment “look as big, bright, and clean as possible”; the walls that weren’t demo&#8217;ed in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/apartment-party-four-five/">Sam and Sean’s</a> kitchen got a much-needed facelift; in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/">Lauren’s</a> studio, she followed her contractor’s advice to skim coat the walls and ceiling to repair the uneven surface and hide bowed beams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Patterned-Floor-Tile.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29454 size-chrono" title="patterned-hexagon-black-floor-tiles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Patterned-Floor-Tile.gif" alt="patterned hexagon black floor tiles and a gray vanity in a bthroom with white subway tiles after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>PATTERNED FLOOR TILE</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bathroom design doesn’t have to be boring; patterned floor tile brings color and interest, regardless of square footage. Go for the unexpected with contrasting grout, a pop of color, or a new twist on classic stone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikki and Chris</a> took inspiration from their favorite New York restaurant bathrooms with black hex tile and white grout; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/an-architect-drafts-a-travel-inspired-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erin and Brian</a> chose a colorful blue mosaic tile; and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/blueprint-comes-life-family-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tina and Fletcher</a> took marble to another level with a graphic basketweave pattern.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/His-and-Her-Bathrooms-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29470 size-chrono" title="white-bathroom-beige-vanity" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/His-and-Her-Bathrooms-2.gif" alt="white bathroom tiles in a large bathroom with beige floating vanity and white double sink after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>SEPARATE (OR SHARED) BATHROOMS FOR COUPLES</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you have two bathrooms or just one master, designing a stylish space to meet the needs of two people is possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/">Leslie</a> combined two bathrooms in her home to create a large, luxurious space and installed an extra-wide mirror and double sink vanity; in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/">Cecilia and Jonathan&#8217;s</a> individual bathrooms, Cecilia wanted a bright, classic space, and incorporated plenty of marble, while Jonathan used stone to make his space resemble a spa; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/">Meg and Brett</a> went with a Kohler slop sink for two circa 1948 and a custom vanity.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Blue-Kitchen-Cabinets.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29460 size-chrono" title="blue-kitchen-cabinets-large-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Blue-Kitchen-Cabinets.gif" alt="blue kitchen cabinets in a large kitchen with white subway tiled backsplash and a small kitchen island after renovation" width="723" height="483" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>BLUE KITCHEN CABINETS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping kitchens cool is as simple as adding the color blue. In Victorian times, it was believed that a touch of blue in the wall paint would help regulate the room’s temperature. Although the motivation has changed, this moody hue has made a triumphant return.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tina and Fletcher</a> redesigned their kitchen with navy cabinets painted in Newburyport Blue by Benjamin Moore; mixing white and blue cabinets add a layer of depth to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mollie&#8217;s</a> space; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/claire-mikes-park-slope-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claire and Mike</a> selected Evening Dove by Benjamin Moore, a bold color choice, which helps define the kitchen from the living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Waterfall-Countertops.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29463 size-chrono" title="waterfall countertops" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Waterfall-Countertops.gif" alt="waterfall countertops" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>WATERFALL COUNTERTOPS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing is more elegant in the kitchen than a waterfall counter. The look elevates an island from a purely functional piece into a sculptural feature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/">Amy and Nick</a> splurged on Carrara marble for their kitchen showpiece; <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/">Alicia and Ed</a> refined the edge of their peninsula with a Caesarstone counter in Statuario Nuvo; Carrara marble made another appearance in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/">Lia and Chris&#8217;</a> space to cap the end of the U-shaped layout, a suggestion from their Sweeten contractor.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Paneled-Fridges-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29471 size-chrono" title="large-white-paneled-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Paneled-Fridges-2.gif" alt="large white paneled cabinets for refrigerator after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>PANELED REFRIGERATORS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t want your refrigerator to be the focal point of your kitchen? Disguise it with custom paneling and let the other features of your space shine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-lightens-up-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ainsley and Simon&#8217;s</a> contractor proposed tucking their fridge into an existing column; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavi and David</a> concealed their appliances among flat-front cabinets; to preserve the classic design of her prewar apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claudia</a> chose custom paneling trimmed with molding.</p>
