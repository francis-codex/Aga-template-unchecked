<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A new chapter for a family home</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brandi and her husband, Chris, inherited her mother-in-law’s 1950s house. Though bittersweet, they were happy to keep it in the family. Chris grew up in the Rockville, Maryland house, so it held special meaning for him. Plus, the family was about to expand. Brandi was pregnant with her second, and her grandmother, Bernice, planned on moving in.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="blue-and-white-kitchen-with-fishbone-backsplash" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="Blue and white kitchen with fishbone backsplash overlooking the dining area after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51581" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a first-time homeowner, Brandi wanted to renovate the 1,643-square-foot house right away to make it fit their lifestyle. However, Chris had a special attachment to it and wasn’t in a rush to remodel. The conversation was tabled for several years. Then, the couple started talking about having a second baby and the idea to renovate returned. This time, the focus was mainly on the kitchen. It was old and outdated. There was little storage space. They had improvised and put in temporary storage containers but they weren’t ideal. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brandi had also toyed with doing a few <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/the-cons-of-diy-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIY projects as a facelift</a>. Mainly, a temporary backsplash and a fresh coat of paint. But, as Brandi put it, “If I’m having a baby, I’m having a new kitchen.” That’s when they turned to Sweeten.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="blue-and-white-kitchen-with-window" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="Blue and white kitchen with appliances and large window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51582" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></h3>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-and-blue-kitchen" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="White and blue modern kitchen with little girl sitting on the quartz countertop after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51578" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></h3>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Local support for kitchen remodeling contractors in Maryland</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brandi was newly pregnant when she found Sweeten. She needed a service like Sweeten to take some of the stress off of the contractor search process. And it was important as people of color to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/support-black-owned-general-contractor-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire a Black-owned general contracting firm</a>. Brandi met with two contractors outside of the Sweeten network but their estimates were too high. And there wasn’t much room for negotiation. She would have to compromise on the design, which she didn’t want to do. Her Sweeten contractor, however, gave her many options in order to fit her budget and style. “He was very thorough,” said Brandi.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">“When the wall came down, I was like, ‘Wow’,” said Brandi. “It definitely opened up the space so much more.”</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-and-blue-kitchen-cabinets" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-09.jpg" alt="White and blue kitchen cabinets with cooking range and fishbone tile pattern backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="1508" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51585" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-09-199x300.jpg 199w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-09-597x900.jpg 597w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></h3>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">“Must-haves” and compromise</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A visit to California inspired Brandi with the idea of two-toned cabinetry. Blue on the bottom, white cabinets above. That was Brandi’s “must-have.” Chris wanted to knock down the wall between the kitchen and dining room as well as center the sink. Brandi thought these weren’t essentials but for Chris, these were his non-negotiables. They were added to the design plan. “When the wall came down, I was like, ‘Wow’,” said Brandi. “It definitely opened up the space so much more.” </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Laying out the kitchen design details</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once the functional and structural details were settled, the kitchen’s design plan came next. Storage would be the main focus for the two-toned cabinets. Brandi wasn’t a fan of clutter and storage would hide the daily essentials. Chris had considered display cabinets but the couple decided against them. The kitchen wasn’t very large so they needed to use the space as efficiently as possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="dining-area-overlooking-open kitchen" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="Dining area overlooking open kitchen with bookcase on wooden flooring after renovation" width="1024" height="683" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51583" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-07.jpg 1024w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition to the cabinets, the backsplash was one design detail that Brandi felt strongly about. She wanted a contemporary look and chose a chevron pattern. It was clean and modern in a white and gray color scheme. For the countertops, butcher block was considered because of its affordable price point. However, their Sweeten contractor was able to source a quartz countertop for around the same cost. The couple decided it would be an upgrade and went for it.  </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A refreshed Rockville kitchen brings renewed joy</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brandi and Chris are thrilled with their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovated kitchen</a>. The open concept allowed the main floor to feel more comfortable for the expanding family. Brandi’s grandmother and daughter can join in as meals are being prepared. And with an expanded family, the new space will be even more appreciated. For Brandi, it’s the little details, down to the new blinds over the centered sink. Brandi said she goes in every morning and opens the blinds to let in the light and finds joy. “It’s like, ‘Ahhh’,” said Brandi. “It’s like the house breathes.”</span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I am from Alexandria, Virginia in the metro Washington, DC area.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>How did you get into the construction industry?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I was graduating college and there was a threat of my father being laid off from his construction job of 20+ years. New management and budgets cuts were taking place. At the time, I was also interning at the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulations. I learned about the lack of women-owned construction companies in the state. It just clicked: With my father&#8217;s remodeling experience and my desire to create a more stable future for our family, there was an opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I asked my father if he would partner up with me to start our own construction company. He would lead the field team and do installations. I would spread the word about his knowledge and experience to home remodelers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our first project was with a homeowner who hired us to build a small kitchen pantry. Little by little, we were recommended to neighbors and became known as a reliable and easy-to-work-with contractor in the community. Over time, we took on an array of projects in DC and Virginia, from simple build-outs to full bathroom, kitchen, and basement remodels. We grew into the experienced company we are today!</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What do you love most about what you do as a general contractor?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The best part of our job is getting the chance to change the sometimes negative narratives about contractors. From time to time we have customers come to us after bad experiences. We aspire to leave all of our customers with good impressions and a first-hand example of what a good experience with a great contracting company can look like. I like to treat my customers how I would like to be treated, with respect, good communication, and quality service. &#8220;Do good unto others&#8221; are words I live by.</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">We enjoy putting that into practice in every aspect of what we do. Ultimately, I love being able to make people feel happy with the remodeling experience as a whole.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The biggest misconception is that a renovation is going to be overwhelming and complicated. With proper planning, preparation, and communication, a renovation can be fun the entire way through!</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite renovation project that you’ve done and why?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We recently completed a full condo remodel in Arlington, Virginia. The homeowner was a woman who wanted to work with a woman-owned contracting firm, a woman-owned interior design company, and a woman-owned virtual assistant company. From beginning to end, the remodel was spearheaded and completed by a team of women-owned companies. The project turned out gorgeous and it was truly so much fun. We celebrated with a fabulous housewarming party that our customer invited us to. It was really neat to be able to experience the space we helped create!</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite Washington DC/Arlington/Fairfax, VA building?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My favorite building in the Washington DC area is the Spy Museum building. It is designed to look very modern and futuristic. I can appreciate the architecture and the way it stands out in the landscape. It&#8217;s worth checking out!</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite Washington DC/Arlington/Fairfax, VA restaurant?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MoMo Sushi in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. They have the most delicious and fresh sushi I have ever had. It is also nestled in the cutest neighborhood close to the Old Town waterfront with great views of the Potomac River and Washington, DC.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>If you weren’t a general contractor, what would you be doing?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If I weren&#8217;t a general contractor, I&#8217;d own a coffee shop. You can find me trying a new latte and reviewing plan sheets at all of the local coffee shops.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="row-houses-metal-fenced-landscaped-yard" class="alignnone wp-image-50982 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WashingtonDCRowHouses.jpg" alt="row houses with porch and red front door and landscaped front yard with black metal fence after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WashingtonDCRowHouses.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WashingtonDCRowHouses-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WashingtonDCRowHouses-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Remodeling pre-war homes in the Washington, D.C. area presents a rewarding challenge. It’s an opportunity to take a piece of the city’s history and both preserve and improve it. You can create a home with more mojo—a home with historic style and contemporary functionality.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Sweeten</span><span class="s1"> offers an outline on what to know before starting older home renovations in Washington, D.C. (plus, which rooms get the most bang for the buck!) </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/washington-dc-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Where do you start when renovating an old house?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Start with your vision for the result. Consider all that you want and prioritize those features with your budget. Talk with a contractor as early in the process as possible. Go over the mandatory elements, such as electrical and plumbing, that will have to meet current code requirements. Older homes typically need complete upgrades of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p6"><span class="s1">Electrical: Older homes need more outlets, plain and simple. Adding plenty of USB outlets makes sense, too, as they allow you to dispense with the extra adapter. Many older homes still suffer from antiquated lighting, with just a solitary ceiling fixture, if that. Energy-efficient puck lights and sconces should be part of any renovation. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">In addition, an updated home should have a 200-amp service, which you’ll learn about through an electrical audit. If you want photovoltaic panels and are allowed to install them, discuss whether the system should be part of your planning with your contractor.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p6"><span class="s1">Plumbing: Efficiency and style have taken over in plumbing, as shown by low-flow “waterfall” showerheads, wall-mounted toilets, and so on. As for the “guts,” of the plumbing system, you can choose a tankless water heater and never run out of hot water, or go with a heat-pump water heater for greater efficiency.</span></li>
<li class="p6"><span class="s1">HVAC system: Improvements abound in HVAC systems, with heat pumps and mini-split systems increasingly popular, along with more effective air filtration systems and energy recovery ventilators becoming standard in many places.</span></li>
<li class="p6"><span class="s1">Windows: Unlike electrical, plumbing, and HVAC, windows are both functional and aesthetic elements, and can vary hugely in cost. Some windows offer more user-friendly features such as opening farther, while others are focused on maximum performance with triple panes and advanced coatings. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Improved performance is laudable, but costs can balloon for small gains in performance. Your choice of windows is a judgment call, so go over this carefully with your general contractor. You should also do research on the window manufacturers and products so you can learn and ask questions. Windows are a major expense (and are not easily changed,) so take the time to get it right.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="basement bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48731" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></span></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner Nicole remodeled her <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/a-sibling-duo-renovates-an-arlington-basement-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement bathroom in Virginia</a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Commonly renovated elements in old homes</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li8"><span class="s5">Woodwork: Other elements that often need help include woodwork, built-ins, and floors. Pre-war homes were often hand-crafted with excellent materials, as there were no reasonable alternatives. Time takes its toll, however, and your home’s woodwork may be showing its age. Unless you want a different look or the materials are badly degraded or damaged, it’s often the best and most cost-effective choice to overhaul the existing elements.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s5">Architectural salvage pieces may have a place in your renovation, as well, and it can be enjoyable to go see what’s available. Your builder, architect, and interior designer will be invaluable in this endeavor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s5">Distressed plaster walls are also a common feature of pre-war homes. Considering the simple materials used, plaster walls are amazing and hold up well. They lend a feeling of solidity and just feel appropriate in an older or historic building. They do tend to crack more readily with settling than newer drywall construction.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Fortunately, this is a relatively easy fix—getting the right plaster pro on the job. Your contractor will make sure new and old blends perfectly, make repairs properly, and leave you feeling great about this subtle yet important element. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="White and blue modern kitchen with little girl sitting on the quartz countertop after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51578" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></span></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Brandi and Chris <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-remodel-rockville-md-for-a-multigenerational-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovated their Maryland kitchen</a></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Kitchen upgrades in old homes</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Because of the intensity of use as the hub of most homes, your kitchen deserves more focus and more of the budget. Not surprisingly, you’ll make more materials and feature choices for the kitchen, as well. Do you really want a six-burner range, or should that money go elsewhere? One feature we strongly recommend is the best cabinets you can afford. Here, you have options.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Off-the-rack” cabinets have improved tremendously in the last few years as manufacturers have stepped up to meet the demand for both style and functionality. By their nature, off-the-rack or in-stock cabinets will offer fewer choices, but that may be fine if you’re happy with the finishes and sizes offered.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Semi-custom and custom cabinets can provide nearly anything you want, such as finishes, specialized hardware, and sizes to fit any space. </span><span class="s7">You can usually expect upgraded</span><span class="s1"> cabinets to show better fit and finish, but you might have to wait for them to be built. This shouldn’t be a problem, as you’ll have many renovation tasks to complete before the cabinets go in.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Another upgrade that might fly under your radar is a heavier sink, either of stainless steel or synthetic material. This is a subjective thing, but heavier sinks just feel solid and have a better, quieter tone with water running on them.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Exterior elements have endured a lot</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Outside, the humid climate in Washington, D.C. is no friend to structures. The mortar in historic brick buildings, for example, needs maintenance periodically. </span><span class="s8">Old bricks were much softer than current bricks, and older lime mortars were more flexible than modern mortars. These older materials worked well together.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Today, however, modern mortar costs about half of the traditional lime mortar, so many repairs over the last couple of decades have used the newer, less pliable mortar, leading to bricks cracking and crumbling, instead of the mortar.</span><span class="s9"> Typically, you’ll find lime mortar in cream or black tones, while the modern mortar is gray. Check this out and talk with your contractor about how much work needs to be done.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Challenges for layout changes and additions</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While these renovation decisions are happening, consider the layout of your home. Does it work for your family, or does it need help? The need for a more functional design may in fact be the driving force behind the entire renovation. Do you need more square footage or just a refinement of the layout? Whether or not you’re able—either physically or legally—to add more square feet is a major factor.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Row homes, for example, may be impossible to add on to. For other homes, setbacks and/or various associations may prohibit changing the home’s footprint, even if the lot has room. If your contractor has worked on other projects in your neighborhood, he or she may already know what’s possible. Nonetheless, it doesn’t hurt to double-check with your historic district.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Allowing for surprises</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It’s inevitable to have a few surprises while remodeling pre-war homes. But budgeting for them and preparing mentally, plus going through the house thoroughly with your contractor, will minimize the chances of a major surprise. You’ll also have permits to pay for, and for this, you’ll want to coordinate with your contractor.</span></p>

<h3>Remodel a basement bathroom for a welcome upgrade</h3>
<p>I love my Arlington Ridge neighborhood with its hilly streets and access to the metro, my favorite Mexican restaurant, and grocery store. When I found the 2,000-square-foot 1950s Virginia ranch home, I fell for the windows, cathedral kitchen, glass porch, and spacious yard. My older sister, Missy, deciding to move from San Francisco back to the East Coast, was a perfect excuse to renovate. She asked to use my downstairs as her temporary home.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48731 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="basement bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p>Before we renovated this (almost) windowless basement bathroom, it was creepy and unwelcoming. The shower had a horrible wall partitioning it off from the rest of the room. The door opened to a full view of the toilet. We never used it. I wanted an open-plan bathroom with plenty of light—a room that guests wouldn’t be scared to use when they visited me in Arlington.</p>
<p>I went into this as a first-time renovator. My biggest question was: Will it be a huge interruption in my workday? I work in business development, so I am on Zoom a lot. We posted our project on Sweeten and we could not have been happier with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woman-owned general contractor</a> we selected.</p>
<h3>Behind the not-so-pleasing wall</h3>
<p>When the contractor removed the wall, she discovered a very vintage pipe system that needed replacement. We looked for a plumbing specialist, and that search set us back a couple of days. Meanwhile, our contractor took the room down to the studs so the plumber could install new piping. The job involved breaking the foundation concrete, but even on days when the jackhammers were out or the water had to be turned off, we had advanced warning.</p>
<h3>Expanding the design palette</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48732" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="Arlington bath remodel" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>My Sweeten contractor made the job seamless and easy, even though what I initially envisioned changed dramatically. I thought I wanted the bathroom all white and clean but decided instead to let this room give the downstairs character. When she proposed the sliding glass barn door as a shower enclosure, I was sold.</p>
<p>The vanity is another fantastic piece, not only for its look but for the storage it brought to the room. I never would have guessed I would <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pick the gray shower floor</a>, but it all came together and it works.</p>

<h3>A beautiful result, and a satisfying experience</h3>
<p>I wanted a modern bathroom to match the rest of the house—and my future renovation plans—and I really lucked out. My contractor was really helpful, connecting with my sister and me and providing the right resources and materials. I understood what to expect throughout the process, and we are both so happy with how the bathroom turned out. Missy, a former tech executive, now works as a startup advisor. She is really enjoying the new digs.</p>

<p>Throughout the process, my contractor’s crew was amazing. My one-year-old beagle, Callie, would shake with excitement when they arrived, play for ten minutes, and then allow them to work. She returned throughout the day to check progress and get head scratches.</p>
<p>My Sweeten general contractor answered my questions, updated me on changes, and discussed any challenges. The team was respectful of my space, too. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">covered the downstairs areas</a> to keep them as clean as possible and left the workspace tidy. I scored with a respectful and professional contracting group that made my rip-and-replace renovation run smoothly, even as I worked from home. I always knew what to expect the next day.</p>

<h3>After a remodel, a basement bathroom has real appeal</h3>
<p>Missy’s gorgeous bathroom is now my favorite thing to show off in the house. It inspired her, too. She recently sold her house and is thinking about where she—and her Aussiedoodle, Ellie—should buy next. New, modern, and clean&#8230;what an upgrade.</p>

			<h2>What to know about bathroom remodeling in Washington DC from costs and permits to ventilation</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46916" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/white-bathroom-Washington-DC-72dpi.jpg" alt="Washington DC bathroom" width="1000" height="714" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/white-bathroom-Washington-DC-72dpi.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/white-bathroom-Washington-DC-72dpi-600x428.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/white-bathroom-Washington-DC-72dpi-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Washington DC has limitless possibilities that make it one of the most exciting places to live in the U.S. If you are considering bathroom remodeling in Washington DC, you may find a parallel set of challenges and possibilities for your project. Not to worry: here we outline what to know before you renovate a bathroom in the DC area.</span></p>
<h3 class="p6"><span class="s2">Defining the area around Washington DC</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2">Remodeling a bathroom in Washington DC first means hammering down its geography. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2">The commonly held notion is that DC consists of the District, Southern Maryland, and Northern Virginia. Sweeten currently services </span><span class="s3">the DC area, Montgomery and Howard counties in Maryland, and select counties in Virginia, including Fairfax and Arlington.</span></p>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">Exterior architecture</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Part of what makes the DC area so appealing is its architecturally significant buildings. Many older and noteworthy buildings are within the District, specifically Georgetown, Capitol Hill, Adams Morgan, and Dupont. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Southern Maryland and Northern Virginia do have some historically important buildings, </span><span class="s4">but not to the extent that the District does.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s2">In the District, Preservation Reviews by the Office of Planning tend to concentrate on exterior work. Interior alterations and non-structural interior demolition are both permitted activities but are exempt from Preservation Reviews.</span></p>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">Renovation bathroom costs in Washington DC</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The cost of remodeling a high-end bathroom in the South Atlantic region, which includes the DC metro area, is higher than the national average. Starting costs for a low-end bathroom remodel is $16,500. A mid-range budget starts at around $26,000. A high-end remodel starts at $38,000 for a 4– or 5–piece bath. (You can read more in Sweeten’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-washington-dc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom remodeling cost guide for Washington DC</a>). Contractors will be able to provide you with more detailed estimates after a site visit. It&#8217;s also important to meet with licensed <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/washington-dc-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Washington DC</a> with local experience who are up-to-date on codes and regulations. </span></p>
<h4>&#8220;Rip-and-replace&#8221; bathroom remodels in older homes</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">A “rip-and-replace” bathroom remodel will always save you money over a full remodel. Like the name says, fixtures are pulled out and replaced. The footprint does not change, nor does the drywall, subfloor, pipes, or wiring. In a “rip-and-replace,” the most expensive items are the toilet, tub or shower, faucet, sink, and cabinet.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">But there is a catch: Washington <span class="s2">DC</span> has a significantly older housing stock. East of the Capitol, north of the K Street business district, up Georgia Avenue, and on either side of the 16th Street corridor, houses can be 100 years old or more. This means that a “rip-and-replace” remodel is usually not possible if the bathroom is in its original state.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">Bathroom remodels for these older homes usually require a full gutting to expose the insides of the walls, including pipes and wiring. Knob-and-tube wiring, common in these homes, must be replaced with modern non-metallic wiring. Additionally, the service panel should be updated. When the studs are bowed or broken, they can be sistered with a parallel stud to the side. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">Many of these older <span class="s2">DC</span> homes were solidly built with materials considered premium for their time. Common materials that <span class="s2">DC</span> homeowners will encounter are cast iron tubs, two-by-fours that actually measure 2 inches by 4 inches, heavy joists, and linoleum. These items can be difficult to remove. For example, homeowners removing cast-iron tubs will need to break or cut them apart on-site to assist with removal.</span></p>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">The effect of climate in DC </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The DC area can get hot—<em>really</em> hot. While DC&#8217;s spring weather is pleasant, the summer climate turns quickly—with record temperatures over 100 F and averages in the 80s. DC’s high humidity keeps everything wet, especially moisture-prone bathrooms.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Explore with a general contractor the full range of measures to keep condensation in the bathroom at bay:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Adequate bathroom exhaust fan<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Openable window, if possible<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Dehumidifier<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Heated flooring<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Wall heater<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Mold-resistant paint<br />
</span></li>
<li>Install a moisture-resistant ceiling</li>
<li>Use moisture-resistant materials such as waterproof drywall or ceramic tiles</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">Permits for Washington DC remodels</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Bathroom remodeling permits are required in the District, Montgomery County, and Fairfax County.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">District: An Alteration and Repair Permit from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) is required. You must submit architectural plans. Since your bathroom remodel will likely be under the Department’s 1,000-square-foot cut-off, you can have your bathroom remodel project fast-tracked with a counter review.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Montgomery County: The Department of Permitting Services will require a Residental Alteration permit. You may need additional electrical and mechanical permits, too.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Fairfax County: Land Development Services requires a permit for interior alterations, as well as for individual projects related to bathroom remodeling such as installing new plumbing fixtures.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">Building approvals</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Remodeling a bathroom in Washington DC proper generally will be more involved than in the suburbs due to the larger number of condos and other board-controlled buildings. Within DC, this will be less of an issue as you move northward to Tenleytown, Petworth, Chevy Chase, and Takoma since more single-family residences are located there.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Even though you own everything within the walls of the condo, condo boards typically require that you submit alteration plans for approval or attend meetings to discuss your proposal. Bathroom remodels are of special interest since these projects touch on critical services such as electrical and plumbing that affect other units. Logistics like parking for workers, elevator usage, and demolition removal must be considered.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Condo boards each have their own personalities and requirements. Board approval can be tricky. But if you are working with an experienced general contractor for the bathroom remodel, they will help you navigate the approval process.</span></p>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">Remodeling a bathroom in Washington DC? Now is the time.</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Don&#8217;t let the possible challenges of remodeling a DC bathroom stop you. There are clear benefits of remodeling to consider; like creative exploration, personal enjoyment, and higher resale value. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46915 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Porch-WashingtonDC-72DPI-CROP.jpg" alt="Front porch" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Porch-WashingtonDC-72DPI-CROP.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Porch-WashingtonDC-72DPI-CROP-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Porch-WashingtonDC-72DPI-CROP-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A well-designed front porch is an important part of the home&#8217;s design. Plus, it serves a function; like a place to relax or a space for greeting visitors. Sadly, many porches don’t suit homeowners&#8217; needs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is especially true of porches on older homes that have been remodeled in the past. Previous homeowners often selected design details that clashed with the character of the house. Some removed the front porch entirely, damaging the integrity of the home&#8217;s design.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take note: Porches for historic houses need to be approved by the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) for Washington DC. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s a good idea to list what you don&#8217;t like about the current porch. From this starting point for the front porch renovation, Sweeten outlines the path to building a structure that works with your lifestyle and the house&#8217;s architectural style.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How will you use the front porch?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Porches are transition spaces between the outside world and home. At the same time, they are an extension of living space that is not quite inside or outside. Start your project by determining how you will use the porch space. Will it be a space to greet guests? Will it be a family gathering spot? Do you plan to eat on the porch?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your answers will help determine the features of the new porch. In the Washington DC area, a ceiling fan will make summer evenings more pleasant. The way the porch will be used also determines its size.  Importantly, not all porches extend across the entire front of the building. <strong>Want to estimate the space needed for renovating your front porch? </strong></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A covered entry for greeting guests or judging the weather before venturing outdoors can be about four feet deep.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Porches for relaxing and living on require more space.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Comfortable seating requires a porch that is at least five feet from the wall of the house to the railing. </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Add a dining table and you will need a wider, or deeper, porch. There should be at least 36 inches from a dining chair to an obstruction, like the house&#8217;s wall. </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">To be comfortable when using the table, plan on a 10-foot-deep porch.</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Fitting the front porch with the house</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes renovating a front porch is done to enhance curb appeal.  A well-designed porch can certainly do that, whether it is a renovation or building a whole new structure. However, it&#8217;s important that the porch complement and contribute to the design of the house. It should not look tacked on.  This is especially important where the original porch was renovated in the past or removed altogether. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Renovating or adding a porch to a period home requires a little research. You can take cues from similar houses in your neighborhood.  And there are historical references, including some online, that list period details. Local designers and contractors can also help get the details right. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Porch designs can relate to the house in a few ways, including using similar materials, roof style and architectural details. Matching roof styles, such as gable or hip roofs, will help the porch integrate with the house. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Match exterior materials</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wood frame houses usually have wood porches. Brick houses have brick or other masonry foundations. The roofing material on the porch should match the material on the house. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Architectural details</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Architectural details can be anything from moldings, decorative brackets and medallions, railings and banisters, and columns. The goal is to incorporate the house&#8217;s style characteristics into the porch design. For example, the trim style around the windows might be used for the fascia of the porch.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Using the correct style of front porch columns</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Columns not only support the roof, but they play an important role in porch design. The trick is to use columns that match the style of the house. A colonial home requires classical columns that are in proportion to the porch and house. A craftsman, or bungalow, house can have stone columns or columns that are clad with siding that matches the house. Also, columns should frame doors and windows. They should not be added where they block a window, for example. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Front porch railing design</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The right railing can make or break a porch design. Victorian homes usually have elaborate &#8220;gingerbread&#8221; type railings. Simple railings with clean lines work well with contemporary home designs.  Your own research and advice from experts can help you settle on the right railing system. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding a new front porch</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Placing a porch where one does not exist should follow the same design rules as renovating a front porch. But the process includes building everything from the foundation to the roof. You will be selecting materials for the flooring, ceiling, and railing that work with the original house. In addition, the porch space has to be in proportion to the original house. And that is important because a house and porch not in proportion will never look right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New porches planned for historic homes in Washington DC have special provisions. Basically, a new porch, as well as a renovated porch, must be historically accurate. Approval for changes come from the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) for Washington DC. It is best to check what is and is not allowed before spending too much time on the design process. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Expanding on the back porch</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Back porches are another matter. There is a 20- or 25-foot setback from the rear property line, depending on location in Washington D.Cthe city. But you cannot build out beyond 10 feet from an adjoining house.  So if your back walls lines up with your neighbor&#8217;s, you can <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build a 10-foot-deep back porch</a>. But if their wall or porch is five feet beyond your wall, you can build out 15 feet. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Building permits for porches</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DCRA is the body that issues building permits. The process from application to approval can take two to four months. DCRA circulates the permit application to a number of government agencies, including the Historic Preservation Division. Navigating the process is difficult. But an experienced designer or general contractor will handle the permit process for you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DCRA will consider property setbacks in the process. In the front, you cannot build beyond an existing structure that is closest to the street. So if houses on your block have porches, you can build out to the porch nearest the street. </span></p>
<h4>Starting a front porch renovation</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Considering your own front porch renovation? Porches provide valuable living space, plus they can <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/curb-appeal-goes-a-long-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enhance the curb appeal</a> of a house. But remember—the design, whether a renovation or new construction,  should look like an extension of the main house.  </span></p>

<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen remodel: Starting at </span><span class="s3"><strong>$20,000</strong>—<strong>$25,000</strong></span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at </span><span class="s3"><strong>$30,000</strong>—<strong>$40,000</strong></span><strong><span class="s4"> </span></strong><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>

<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Starting at </span><strong><span class="s3">$21,000</span></strong> <span class="s5">or <strong>$600</strong> psf.</span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li>

<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Adding square footage: Starts at <strong>$120</strong> psf<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Total Gut Renovation Costs for a DC Home</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A total gut renovation in Washington DC that brings a home down to its frame and studs could start at around </span><span class="s4"><strong>$100</strong> psf</span><span class="s1">. Doing it all at once will get you the best price per square foot if you are already planning multiple projects. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much does a Washington DC kitchen remodel cost per square foot?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A best-value kitchen remodel typically starts between </span><span class="s3"><strong>$20,000</strong>—<strong>$25,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. This allows the replacement of cabinets and countertops from big-box stores, a stocked appliance package, and tile flooring.<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">For a mid-grade kitchen, expect starting costs between </span><span class="s3"><strong>$30,000</strong>—<strong>$40,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. This pricepoint would include semi-custom cabinets, hardwood floors, upgrade in appliances, and an island (with no sink).<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/washington-dc/"><span class="s2">report</span></a> found the average cost in the Washington DC area costs around <strong>$68,000</strong>. This works out to be <strong>$340</strong> psf. About 60 percent of the cost is recouped in the value it adds to your home. With a budget of this amount, you can remodel a 200-square-foot space with countertops, semi-custom wood cabinets, and a stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet. It also allows the addition of a built-in microwave, dishwasher, and custom lighting. Other than<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/"><span class="s2"> adding a kitchen island</span></a>, the layout, such as where the oven and dishwasher are installed, must remain the same as the original design. Keeping your layout will be the biggest influence in a low budget down.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">For a high-end kitchen remodel, costs start at </span><strong><span class="s3">$68,000</span></strong><span class="s1"> and include a stone or marble countertop as well as opening up the space or removing a wall.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A luxury remodel comes in at an average of <strong>$135,000</strong> for Washington DC, the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/washington-dc/"><span class="s2">report</span></a> found. The psf cost is <strong>$675</strong>. This project can add 58 percent of the budget to your home’s value. A high-end kitchen remodel can consist of custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported ceramic or glass tile backsplashes. The appliances would also kick up a few notches to include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood. The kitchen can also have designer faucets and a water filtration system.</span></p>

<h3></h3>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much does a DC bathroom remodel cost per square foot?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">For a best-value bathroom, expect a typical project to start between </span><span class="s3"><strong>$12,000</strong>—<strong>$15,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. At this budget, it would not be a gut but a refresh.<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A mid-grade bathroom remodel has costs at </span><strong><span class="s3">$21,000</span></strong><span class="s1"> or <strong>$600</strong> psf. These figures come from the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/new-england/boston-ma/"><span class="s2">report</span></a>. For this price,  you can remodel a 35-square-foot bathroom. It includes adding a porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. This renovation can add <strong>$14,000</strong> to a home’s value. That’s 65 percent of the project’s cost.<br /></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A high-end bathroom remodel starts at </span><strong><span class="s3">$40,000</span></strong><span class="s1">. This budget includes a 3 or 4-piece bath such as the sink, shower/tub combination, and toilet. For <strong>$67,000</strong>, a 5-piece bathroom could be installed.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the 2020 Cost Vs Value report, the average price in this category is around <strong>$67,000</strong>. For this price, you can expand your bathroom from 35 square feet to 100 square feet. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/remodeling-a-bathroom-six-trends-to-consider-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new bathroom</a> can have features like a freestanding soaker tub. On top of that, you can have a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. Your budget can also afford a double sink and double-mirror vanity with custom draws and wall cabinets.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding square footage to your DC home </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enlarging living space to an existing floor plan starts at <strong>$120</strong> psf and can easily go up to <strong>$20</strong>0 psf. The most economical addition is adding square footage over a crawl space. An extension where you are adding or adjusting the foundations will come in around <strong>$150</strong> psf. The cost increases to <strong>$200</strong> psf if a wet space—bathroom, laundry, or kitchen—is added. </span><span class="s1">The cost of adding a second floor can start at <strong>$150</strong> psf.  </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Remodeling costs in DC: Permits</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The District of Columbia is a compact city of only 69 square miles. The Council of the District of Columbia issues building permits for this area. Permits cost two percent of the budget for work over <strong>$1,000</strong>. For example, a permit for <strong>$20,000</strong> bathroom will cost <strong>$400</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Prince George’s County, to the east and south of the city, uses an equation for <a href="https://princegeorgescountymd.gov/DocumentCenter/View/23559/DPIE-Fee-Schedule-PDF?bidId="><span class="s2">permit fees</span></a>. <strong>$50</strong> + (Construction Costs x 0.008) = permit fee. So, a <strong>$20,000</strong> renovation would cost <strong>$210</strong>. Watch out for specific fees for projects such as basement finishing which is <strong>$340</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Montgomery County, the area to the north,<a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/DPS/Resources/Files/IT/AllFees.pdf"><span class="s2"> building permits</span></a> for alterations, additions, and repairs start at <strong>$270</strong>.</span></p>
