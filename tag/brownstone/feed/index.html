<h3>Finding their circa 1900 Brooklyn brownstone home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a grueling year-long search, countless open houses, and one house lost in a bidding war, we found our home. Remarkably, it had everything we wanted: it was a two-family home in the heart of “brownstone” Brooklyn, with original hardwood floors. Most of the houses in the neighborhood were built circa 1900. Many we viewed did not stand the test of time, but this home had been in the same family for years and did not show the usual wear-and-tear of a 100-year-old home. We were lucky, but we did need to <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embark on an old home renovation</a>.</p>

<p>I was thankful to stumble upon <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> early in my search for <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Bed-Stuy</a>. While I had owned a home before, this was our first time doing a large-scale Brooklyn <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/townhouse-renovation-guide-purchasing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brownstone renovation</a> that would require more than our DIY skills could handle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The layout of the house and our budget did not afford us a ton of options, so the renovation was straightforward. We focused on structural changes to change the flow and use of the house. Thankfully, when we moved in, we were able to live in the garden floor apartment while we renovated the upper two floors where we would eventually live.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-08.jpg" alt="brownstone living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45702" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45700" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Salvaging and repurposing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We removed the original entry doors as you come into the entry foyer, but left the structural wall intact. This allowed the area to feel more open as you continue into the living area; it also gave back more livable space to work with. However, I loved the original details of the doors. Luckily, they just fit the ceiling clearance on the second floor and they found new life as the guest room headboard.</p>
<p>In the living room and through to the kitchen, we tore down two walls and exposed a long expanse of brick wall. The former owner had repointed the brick in the front room with black mortar, which was a real eyesore. When we exposed the whole length of the house, we were left with two walls that didn’t match. Limited by our budget, we repointed the half that was previously covered and experimented with painting techniques to blend the two together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-07.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45701" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>An overhaul for the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">I wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the updated kitchen</a> to be the focus of the home. There were three main obstacles: adding a door for backyard access, the ceiling height, and a must-have double oven. I initially wanted to enlarge the back window above the sink to make it a focal point and let in more natural light. Not far along into <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the kitchen process</a>, I had to abandon that idea since we were concerned with what the enlarged opening would do to the structural integrity of the home, given its age. It was also a huge expense so we chose to use those dollars elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In the end, we actually made the window above the sink slightly smaller to allow for a proper backsplash. We replaced the second window with a door and added a small landing and stairs for easy backyard access.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-12.jpg" alt="townhouse kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45706" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-16.jpg" alt="beer tap" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45710" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-16-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Finding the right appliances</h3>
<p>The next question was how to vent the hood with 11-foot-high ceilings and open shelving left nowhere to hide. Ultimately, the ducting was kept exposed and vented directly through the wall outside. I love the industrial element it adds to the newly renovated space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, where to fit the double oven? At first, I was concerned I would be giving up valuable pantry space, but the layout worked out perfectly and there was room for everything we wanted, even the custom built-in beverage taps. We are home-brewing enthusiasts and wanted a unique feature in our kitchen to showcase that.</p>

<h3>Splurging and saving</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We needed to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refresh the first-floor bath</a> which was an easy update. The layout was already functional, so we kept it as-is with a direct replacement—aka rip-and-replace—of all the fixtures. We were able to salvage the original door and reuse the existing tub. We later put our DIY skills to the test and added fun wallpaper and wainscoting.</p>

<p>&#8220;He worked with us to determine where we could splurge and save.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The top floor previously served as a separate apartment complete with its own kitchen. We wanted to have a master bedroom, master closet, master bathroom, guest bedroom, and laundry room. The tricky part was figuring out where to put everything. The pre-existing kitchen allowed us to easily add a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer and dryer</a> without a huge expense. Once that was decided, everything else fell into place.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-09.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45703" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The master bedroom closet is a dream spot that had been a small room that our contractor converted. My favorite splurge on the top floor was adding a heated bathroom floor to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the bathroom process</a>—worth every penny in the winter.</p>
<p>Throughout the house, we did some major upgrades that elevate the whole space: we put up fresh drywall throughout the second floor, refinished the original floors in a dark walnut color, and replaced all the windows in the house.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-28.jpg" alt="townhouse bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45722" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-28.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-28-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-28-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Brooklyn brownstone renovation: budget and process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While I would not necessarily recommend living in a renovation (so much dust), it did allow us to check on the progress and be more involved in day-to-day decisions such as outlet locations and doorknob height. We optimistically thought the renovation would take three months, but we did add on some significant projects that stretched the timeline. Overall, once we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose our contractors</a>, the project took about five months to complete the top two floors with some minor updates in the garden apartment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aligning our budget</a> was our major obstacle, but <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consulting with our contractor</a> was great. He worked with us to determine where we could <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">splurge and save in each room</a>. Once our Sweeten contractor realized we were quite handy, we were able to figure out what we could do ourselves versus what we should leave to the professionals. For example, we chose to take on all the painting, which was a huge undertaking. I’m talking all ceilings, all walls, all trim, and multiple coats! I don’t think we understood what a huge task it was—and that in certain spaces, the contractor was unable to move forward until we completed painting. I’m glad we did it, but it was a grueling several months and I’m pretty sure I gave myself carpal tunnel.</p>

<h3>Switching the brownstone layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest change in terms of the function of the home was separating the garden floor apartment from the upper two floors. In dividing the two, we were able to gain a coat closet in the apartment and additional storage space for us before the basement level. The ground floor is now available as its own standalone rental unit, while we live on the two floors above. Now that the house is done, I am so thankful we splurged on what we wanted—replacing the windows, skim-coating, and repointing the brick; those are some of my favorite things in the house.</p>

<h3>Popular questions asked</h3>

<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1635937202274"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is a brownstone?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Brownstone is a historically popular building material. Short for brown sandstone, brownstone is characterized by its dark appearance due to the ample amount of iron in the stone. Typically, a true brownstone house will be made of brick, with only the exterior being sandstone. Sandstone—also called freestone—is soft, which makes it easy to cut in any direction. This allows for a multitude of styles and variety in design.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1635937223936"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What does a brownstone house look like?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Brownstone houses have the basement above ground, with a stoop staircase extending up the main floor. Brownstones were originally designed so that the basement would not be able to flood, and any water that got into the basement would be minimal. Normally these townhomes are between 3 and 4 floors, which provides ample living space.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1635937245671"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Why are brownstones so expensive?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Even though brownstone is great for sculpting and pattern making, it is a fragile material. Many brownstones were built in the 19th century, so the restoration process for 21st-century homeowners can be lengthy and intricate. The fragility of the stone makes it very hard to replicate what used to exist and then to match it to the surrounding brownstone townhomes. The intricate designs allow for a beautiful finish, but it comes at a price.</p>

<h3>Modernizing a Brooklyn bathroom in a timeless way</h3>

<p><span>For Peggy and Jack, renovating the master bath in their circa late-1800s Brooklyn brownstone was an easy decision: they had leaks in the bathroom that couldn’t be ignored anymore. They were nearing the end of their twins’, Cayley and Sam, college careers, so they could refocus their financial commitments. The outdated pink-and-black tile and the oddly-placed shower also contributed to the necessary overhaul. They wanted to modernize their Brooklyn bathroom, but not load it with trendy design statements that’d be “out” in a few years. </span><span class="s10_overlay-text"></span></p>
<p><span class="s10_overlay-text"></span><span>Their Brooklyn brownstone is configured as an owner-occupied triplex and basement rental unit—and they have grand plans for the historic building in the future. “ We have a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multigenerational plan for living</a> in our house, so we aren’t concerned about short-term resale maximization,” says Peggy. “We wanted to stay true to the spirit and look of the classic brownstone style, but update the bathroom with a water-efficient toilet and fixtures.</span><span>”</span></p>
<h3>Achieving their dream bathroom aesthetic</h3>
<p><span class="s10_overlay-text"></span><img decoding="async" title="bathtub-with-marble-wall-tiles" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-09.jpg" alt="bathtub with marble wall tiles and grab bar and patterened floor tiles and dark blue vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-51571 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span>“The idea was to have this renovation be fine for decades,” says Peggy. “We wanted something classic, electrical and plumbing up to code, and environmentally friendly but that would respect the aesthetic of our centenarian house.” Installing safety compliant features like easy tub access, grab bars, and non-slip flooring was also a priority. </span></p>
<p><span class="s10_overlay-text"></span><img decoding="async" title="marble-tiles-on-bathroom-walls" loading="lazy" class="higd100 s10-has-overlay alignnone wp-image-43878 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Peggy-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="navy blue single vanity with farmhouse sink and marble tiles on walls and countertop and sage paint on half walls and patterned floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Peggy-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Peggy-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Peggy-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-overlay-text-loaded="" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="marble-wall-tiles-with-recessed-shelves" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="bathtub with marble wall tiles and recessed shelves and grab bar next to a window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-51563 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/39003-Peggy-Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They originally planned to move the tub under the window, which had been done with their kids’ bathroom a few years ago.  “We like to take baths, and were motivated to expand floor space and have the window view when soaking,” said Peggy. “However, we realized that also meant we couldn’t have grab bars on a  window wall.” </span></p>
<p><span>Their Sweeten contractor referred them to a designer, who then consulted on the space’s layout. The designer suggested leaving the tub in place and moving the toilet to make more space for a larger vanity. Good advice!</span><span> The end result of the renovation is undeniable: “It’s clean, fresh, serene…and has no leaks!” The couple also used six inches of space behind the shower wall for building in double storage niches.</span></p>
<p><span><u>Bonus</u>: They repurposed their hallway mirror for their bathroom, since it had the vintage feel they wanted. </span></p>

<h3>The final project for a brownstone remodel</h3>
<p><span class="s1">This is it. Our apartment. The pied-à-terre we’ve long waited to move into. We have a primary residence on Long Island, but we work in NYC and spend about half our time here. We decided to invest in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/townhouse-renovation-guide-purchasing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-family townhouse</a> in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, rent each of the main units and keep the smaller, fourth-floor apartment for ourselves.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">From the time we first saw the top-floor space, we knew it would be our city home. Like the other two rental apartments we remodeled with <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> in this brownstone, this one-bedroom unit needed work. It was dark and chopped up, the kitchen was a wreck and the bathroom was in disrepair. We started thinking about how to refresh the under 600-square-foot space and make it feel larger. Our goal was to create an open and airy studio. We planned to maximize natural light and use natural materials for an organic feel. </span></p>
<h3>More space with natural light</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In our rentals, we’d worked to preserve the building’s architectural features. But in this unit, previous renovations had removed most original detail. Hardwood floors had been replaced with linoleum. Moldings that might have graced the overhead plaster were replaced with a drop ceiling. Only the window moldings and the fireplace remained. Given this situation, we felt free to rethink the space. We decided to use modern elements as influences for the new interior. Our brownstone remodel had Scandinavian style and Californian mid-century modernism.</span></p>

<div>
<p>Our architects, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3341#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MNDPC</a>, worked closely with Janet and our <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a> to achieve several architectural changes. First, we moved the entrance from the fourth floor down to the third, making the stairway part of the apartment’s interior. This increased privacy and usable space, and also allowed us to increase the living room’s natural light with a skylight at the top of the stairs.</p>

<span class="s6">Our contractor suggested the beams looked really good unpainted and unfinished.</span>

<h3>A brownstone remodel exposes the beams</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Next,</span><span class="s1"> we exposed the</span><span class="s5"> living-room ceiling. Opening it to the original wooden beams</span><span class="s1"> provided for more vertical space and a lofty room. </span><span class="s6">Initially, we were going to paint the wooden ceiling and exposed beams white.</span> <span class="s6">Our contractor suggested the beams looked really good unpainted and unfinished. </span><span class="s1">The adjacent sleeping area, however, would have a new lowered ceiling, and an archway. These subtle architectural elements bring the space together while simultaneously differentiating the sleeping and living rooms. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The arch plays nicely with horizontal lines throughout the apartment, including the exposed beams and the long kitchen countertop. It also connects with a number of graceful curves, like the rounded mirror over the restored fireplace and the roun</span>ded lighting fixtures.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43654" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-21.gif" alt="integrated kitchen cabinetry" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1">W</span></span><span class="s1">e moved to the problematic floors, which were covered in vinyl and old carpeting. We wanted natural wood and after much searching, we chose <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/how-to-know-when-to-replace-wood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white-oak flooring</a>. The planks would lay in a</span><span class="s5"> custom herringbone, or chevron, pattern</span><span class="s1">. Unfortunately, there was a long lead time for the wood to be custom cut (nearly two months coming from Europe), not to mention a high price. Just before going back to the drawing board, we found a pre-cut herringbone at half the price. It came out fantastic.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-13.jpg" alt="integrated kitchen brownstone remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-43648 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>A minimal kitchen for a second home</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once the floors were down we were ready to </span><span class="s7">build the kitchen.</span><span class="s1"> We found dark wood cabinets from Ikea that not only looked great but pleased our budget! We wanted countertops that would complement the cabinets and wear well. Soapstone had the durability and appearance that worked</span>. The veined black goes nicely with the apartment’s other dark features and looks fantastic as a backsplash.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To stay minimal, we hid appliances in cabinets; our washer/dryer combo, fridge, and pull-out freezer all fit under the counter. </span><span class="s1">The pendant lights over the kitchen counter, the chandelier above the old fireplace, and the bedroom </span>fixtures are simultaneously industrial, modern, casual, and polished.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3.jpg" alt="Brownstone remodel eat-in niche" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-43646 size-full" title="Brownstone-remodel-eat-in-niche" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3>Bringing sunlight inside</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the </span><span class="s5">bathroom</span><span class="s1">, we managed another stunning redesign thanks to our architects we found through Sweeten. The shower, a vertical space with a skylight, is flooded by day with natural sunlight, making it feel almost like it’s outside. One disappointment that turned out fine was with the stone floor tiles. We spent a lot of time picking them out, but after accepting our order, the supplier said that only one box of tile was available</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-bathroom-10.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="1498" class="alignnone wp-image-43638 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-bathroom-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-bathroom-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JanetJerry-bathroom-11.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-44069 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JanetJerry-bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JanetJerry-bathroom-11-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JanetJerry-bathroom-11-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our contractor solved the issue. He took a large slab of the same stone and custom cut it into a single 3’x3’ shower base as well as a door saddle, and a stone shelf. </span><span class="s8">We chose an in-wall toilet to maximize space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having knocked down walls and invited light in every way imaginable, we felt successful in our visual opening of the space. We went even further by creating an </span><span class="s5">outdoor area</span><span class="s1">. The roof had formerly b</span>een inaccessible but we replaced a window with a glass door; it leads to a new roof deck with views of the neighborhood and Manhattan in the distance.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-roof-19.jpg" alt="roof deck" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-43657 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-roof-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-roof-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-roof-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Happy at home</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Through it all, we felt lucky to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with Sweeten</a>, which connected us with both our architect and contractor and helped us troubleshoot on many occasions. The process came with so many rewards. Janet says she most appreciated the design w</span><span class="s1">ork and creative discussions of a brownstone remodel.</span><span class="s4"> I’m just </span><span class="s1">enjoying our apartment! It’s like staying in a nice hotel with a feeling of being home. The best of both worlds.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>We’re back again this week with Part 2 of Nazli and Larry’s historic Brooklyn brownstone renovation in Bedford-Stuyvesant. If you missed it—check out <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part I</a></i></span><span class="s1"><i> where Nazli walked us through their planning process and showed off the foyer and guest suite. Here, she shows off the rest of the parlor floor, including the kitchen, the dining room, and the powder room. Nazli explains the challenge of merging modern and traditional within the confines of a townhouse’s long and narrow configuration. Read on for her thoughts on powder rooms (wackiness is key), decorative mantels (rather pointless), and coming to terms with the budget required to achieve the renovation you want (very tough).</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think the biggest challenge to any renovation is…the renovators obviously. There will always be a push and pull between the architect, the contractor, and the owners. And most of the time, that will yield a better product than any single entity could have envisioned (but not always). I think our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect was fantastic</a> in coming up with some great solutions to space challenges–especially on the parlor floor, where I insisted we needed a half-bath that was nowhere near the kitchen (because, gross), a hall closet, and a kitchen pantry. She really provided a lot of help in making sure the house was up to code and that the spaces flowed. Our contractor (and my husband’s best friend), did an awesome job of value engineering so we could get the most bang for our buck. The decorating of the spaces was left mostly to me and it was interesting trying to figure out my own taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We, like all imperfect clients, wanted this Brooklyn brownstone renovated on a contractor&#8217;s-grade budget. Obviously, we were being silly and went way over budget (and right at what our contractor told us it would cost; we were just deeply in denial about the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of construction</a> in NYC). The mechanicals in a home are so expensive that basically most of the money was gone before we made a single design choice. And for me, I care deeply about the fixtures, finishes, and materials and I wasn’t about to cheap out on the things we had to see and use every day. So just be honest with yourself about what you want and what you’re willing to pay or give up for it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I was most excited about the kitchen<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>if that hasn’t already been made clear. I love throwing huge parties and dinners, and I like to spend my alone time cooking. It’s also a natural gathering spot, so it was exciting to think about getting the most out of the space. Turns out the space configuration of a Brooklyn brownstone made it hard to do that, but it still served us well—I am super happy with a long <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> (11 feet long!), a BlueStar stove, and the different stations for cooking, eating, making coffee, or baking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen is my happy spot and I’ve spent years thinking about what makes a good kitchen. Is this ideal space planning? Nope. Is this my idea of a good time? For sure. The challenge was how to devise an open-plan area that was going to take up so much of the parlor floor without making it feel like a separate room. My solution was to forgo upper <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> so there&#8217;s a clear line of vision from the front of the room all the way to the dining room. This created a storage challenge for me, of course, which we solved with a kitchen pantry. I wanted the pantry to be open so that I could see and access all my ingredients easily, but I also didn’t want a lot of visual clutter. I <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painted</a> the cabinets and shelves a deep gray (same color as the island cabinets), which makes the whole space disappear once I turn out the light. I found a piece of scrap marble at the stone yard which I used for the kitchen backsplash and the countertops along the back wall closest to the pantry. Marble is expensive and hard to maintain, so my thought was to use it in low-use areas to give the look and feel of the material throughout the kitchen without spending that much. For the island and other countertops, I used poured concrete, which is a material I love. Surprisingly, it’s also pretty delicate, but it’s subtle and earthy and I like how it ages. The kitchen is, again, more traditional than I would have preferred, but I think the concrete and the open shelving give it a more modern touch. Also, I fought to get a second sink in the kitchen and am so happy I won that battle. It’s handy to set up a water station so people can grab water or rinse out cups without interrupting my cooking space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I can’t say enough about how much I love these herringbone walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>. We splurged on these floors and went with the less costly white oak for the upstairs floors because…well, just look at them. My original vision was to have the tile floor in the kitchen, but it made more sense to continue the wood on the whole parlor floor and save the tile for the back extension. We mocked up the island with plywood and adjusted it until I was happy with the dimensions—how it felt to go from sink to stove, or how easy it was to take food out of the fridge and place it on the counter. That kind of stuff is important to me, and this was the first time I really got to design my own kitchen for myself. Everything is a bit taller and it suits me just great.</p>
<p>A note on accessibility: I’ve had friends and families with different mobility and impairment issues—whether wheelchair-bound, deaf, or arthritic—and time spent with them has made me very conscious of what it means to design well for many. A landmarked Brooklyn brownstone is a nightmare for anyone with a wheelchair, a walker, or a stroller, and I also saw firsthand some of the challenges that my design choices presented.</p>
<p>The first set of cabinet pulls in the kitchen were a lovely set of straight, minimalist tab pulls. I loved that they gave the kitchen a more modern look. Cue my mother and mother-in-law coming over all the time and struggling with the pulls. They couldn’t grasp the straight pull with their arthritic fingers. I switched them out right away for pulls with a fully curved handle. Now they can just stick their finger under the pull, and a small motion opens the drawers. People keep talking about their &#8220;forever homes,&#8221; but really think about how you, your guests, and your children will have to adapt to the spaces as everyone starts to get older.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other end of our Brooklyn brownstone, and connected to the kitchen, is the dining room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar</a>. We love this room. We really felt like this room, a back extension added in the 1910s, was the reason we bought this place. Then we sadly rebuilt the entire room, but somehow, it’s still our favorite space in the house. So that was a great surprise—buying a house because of one room and then recreating it and still having that be the best spot in the house. It’s our dining room and bar, but we also have space under the dining bench to store all of Nacho’s gear so that he can draw and play at the table while I am cooking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From being in other friends’ homes, I knew that extensions were always freezing cold and hard to heat. All I wanted was Moroccan tile for this room (in fact, for the whole house, but we just didn’t have the budget for that). Everyone fought me on adding radiant heating to the subfloor, but it’s by far the warmest room during the winter. Larry and I often come home and lie down on the floor and accidentally fall asleep! During the summer, this is the room we hang out in while kids run in and out of the house to the backyard. The best surprise? That giant Tiffany stained-glass window, which was hidden by a crappy 1970’s bookcase on the inside and vinyl siding on the outside. As soon as we bought the house, we ripped down the bookcase hoping we’d find a window, and lo and behold, we did. It was in near perfect condition. We completely sealed it with clear glass on the outside to avoid damage and heat loss, as we did with all the other stained glass details around the parlor floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a large fireplace in this room, but I couldn’t figure out how to fit the mantel and Larry’s bar, and after much cajoling, I finally convinced Larry to agree to rip out the fireplace. The mantel has a new home in the living room, where the original had been removed previously. I will say, to the horror of preservationists everywhere, that I wish we didn’t have our mantels—they don’t work, they take up too much space, and they create artificial focal points in every room. Maybe if they were marble, I’d appreciate them more. It’s form without function, which I have no love for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The powder room was a tough one to figure out. I hate the idea of guests having to go upstairs to use the bathroom, and with a small child, it&#8217;s great to have a bathroom on every floor. I think powder rooms should be wacky. This one is tiny, so doing a fun wallpaper or paint color was relatively cheap. I love the electric Cole &amp; Sons Palms wallpaper—it adds a touch of fun to an otherwise formal dining room. I also love the pop of color from the door to the powder room. We hated having the stained glass window facing a dull orange wall because it cast a weird orangey glow into the room. Rather than fight it, though, we decided to paint the door an amped-up version of that wall to tie the colors together in a fun way.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are that once you find the right townhouse (good bones, ideal location, right price) in New York City, the space is going to need some work. After all, many of these houses—particularly classic brownstones—date back to the late 1800 and early 1900s. </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free service that matches homeowners with vetted general contractors, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">spoke to Sweeten’s founder and CEO, Jean Brownill, and <a href="https://www.compass.com/agents/chris-halliburton?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Halliburton</a>, associate broker of investment sales at <a href="https://www.compass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compass</a>, to put together a comprehensive guide about the questions to ask before you buy and how to get started on your townhouse renovation plan once the papers are signed, sealed, and delivered.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Questions to Ask During Your Search for a Townhouse</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for a townhouse to renovate, you probably already have an idea of the kind of home and lifestyle you’re looking to create. Perhaps you&#8217;re tired of neighbors stomping above you and dealing with your restrictive co-op board, or you are drawn to the dream of owning your very own roof terrace and backyard—aren’t we all? Or maybe you’d also like rental income to offset the cost of home ownership, or you’re an investor looking to maximize rental income.  Whatever your motivations, your townhouse renovation search should be narrowed to the properties that will allow you to create the lifestyle you’re looking for. Here are the questions to ask during your search.</span></p>
<h4><b>1.) What’s the building’s history?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where you gather information about the soundness of the property. New York City’s </span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/index.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Buildings (DOB)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a great site where you can look up the history of the property and see the violations, complaints, as well as applications and permits for prior work done to the property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for red flags, and use the information to determine whether prior work—especially structural changes or alterations to the plumbing, electrical, and mechanicals—has been executed properly. </span><a href="https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property Shark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is another place where you can access comprehensive, publicly available information about the property in question.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-brown-floor-white-kitchen" class="alignnone wp-image-31419 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12.jpg" alt="white kitchen with brown floor and white kitchen cabinets with recessed lights on ceiling after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) </em>AJ and Ray’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-townhouse-renovation-makes-a-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">townhouse renovation</a></span></p>
<h4><b>2.) What’s the actual square footage versus the buildable square footage?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many townhouses are on lots much larger than the current building footprint. For example, brownstones are often on 100-foot lots, but the building itself may only be 20’ x 35’. Chris explains that these properties can often be built back with extensions ranging from ten to 30 feet long, depending on the floor area ratio (FAR). The </span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/districts-tools/residence-districts-r1-r10.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAR is determined by the zoning designation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and in New York City, the Zoning Resolution designates ten residential districts. For example, a lot that is 20’ x 100’ in an R7-2 zone that has a FAR of 3.44 allows you to put up a 6,880-square-foot building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also be able to expand vertically. This is almost always a given, Chris says, although you may be constrained by landmark preservation requirements (see below). Similarly, you should explore excavation possibilities for creating a cellar. While below-grade space is not counted in the square footage, it is often useful to add space below for mechanicals or storage, even if it is not livable. By storing these elements underground, you can free up space above grade to maximize your living space and/or rental income potential.</span></p>

<h4><b>3.) What are the existing conditions?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the information that you gather via city databases, pay attention to the existing conditions of the building. Are there signs of water damage, mold, or termites? Also be aware of outside forces beyond an owner’s control—is there a lot of ongoing or planned construction in the area?</span></p>
<p>If there is an empty lot next door, find out what is happening there. Chris points out that the construction of tunnels for the Second Avenue subway expansion was a major issue for surrounding properties, not only in terms of noise and inconvenience but also with structural damage related to shifting foundations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it currently a single-family dwelling that you intend to turn into a two-family? Or vice-versa? Be prepared to hire an architect if so.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1bZ07c4-A0&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40881 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h4><b>4.) Is the property landmarked or in a historic district?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/lpc/about/about-lpc.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landmark Preservation Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is New York City’s governing agency for preserving buildings and sites that are culturally, historically, and architecturally significant. Many brownstone townhouses happen to be in designated historic districts—there are a total of more than 36,000 landmark properties in 141 historic districts and extensions throughout the five boroughs, according to the LPC’s website.</span></p>
<p>If the townhouse you’re considering is protected, you will need to submit any planned changes to the LPC for review at the same time that you submit plans to the DOB. Chris explains, “Anything that the LPC approves will be approved 99 percent of the time by the DOB. But it’s not the case vice versa.” In particular, any changes to the façade will be scrutinized by the LPC. For example, while a back extension will not affect the view of the building from the street, adding floors will. If you want to add to the top of the building, you may be required to start 20 feet back from the front of the building, so that the additional floor can’t be seen from the street.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An LPC review will add extra time to your townhouse renovation, so this should be a consideration, especially if you are looking to bring in rental income on a deadline.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32953 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="bathroom remodel blue subway tile" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Financing Your Townhouse Renovation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obtaining financing for a townhouse purchase and renovation is essentially the same process as a condo purchase and renovation (co-ops are the outlier here). This is because a townhouse, like a condo, is real property. You can consult </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/financing-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this Sweeten guide on financing home renovations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are financing both the purchase of the property as well as the renovation, you have a few options (Jean advises consulting a professional to see what’s best for your situation).</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Apply for a construction loan and a permanent mortgage separately. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means you will need to research two separate loans and pay for two sets of closing costs. Some lenders only provide construction loans, while others will only make combination loans. Construction loans typically run for 12 months or less and are subject to an adjustable interest rate that resets quarterly or sometimes monthly.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>OR</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Apply for a construction-to-permanent loan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This combination instrument simplifies the process because you only need to take out one loan and pay closing costs once. It’s the more popular option for this reason. While construction is ongoing, you only pay interest on the outstanding balance, and then it is converted to a mortgage after the renovation is complete. You may, however, pay more for the permanent mortgage because the need for a combination has reduced your lender options.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25528 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-01.jpg" alt="townhouse doorway renovation " width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br /><span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) </em>Nazli and Larry’s  </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brownstone renovation</span></a></p>
<h3><strong>Who You’ll Need On Your Team</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When searching for a townhouse to renovate, it’s important to gather the experts who will not only help you get the job done right, but who can help you assess whether it’s a project worth tackling in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, you’ll need to line up several professionals early on, including structural engineers, electricians, and plumbers. Chris suggests that you bring these pros in for site visits prior to signing the contract so that you don’t “end up buying a money pit.” He estimates that you could have all these consultations done for roughly $1,500 to $2,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to general contractors, Jean understands firsthand the importance of having a professional you can trust. “When I started to renovate my own Brooklyn brownstone, I ended up hiring the wrong general contractor,” she said. “If I can make a wrong choice, anyone can.” She started Sweeten to help homeowners find licensed and vetted contractors and to ultimately renovate fearlessly to create a home they love.</span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639150923230"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is a townhouse?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A townhouse is a common style of housing in cities and suburbs. Townhouses tend to be multi-floor units with private entrances. Townhouses share one or more walls with adjoining townhouse units; which differentiates them from single-family homes. Townhouse units may have small front or back yards, balcony spaces, or covered porches. </p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639150942067"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is the difference between a condo and a townhouse?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A “condo” (short for condominium) is a style of housing usually located within a community of buildings owned by individuals. A “condo” community may have shared amenities like a gym, pool, garden, or adhere to rules set by an HOA. A townhouse is a style of home; generally multi-floor with shared walls with other townhouses. If a townhouse is located within a community of similar homes, it may qualify as a condominium.</p>

			<h2>From condo to brownstone overhauls, a few of our favorite projects in the neighborhood</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Distinguished by its deep cultural and historic roots, Bedford-Stuyvesant, (aka Bed-Stuy) is a sprawling area also known for 19th-century brownstones, festive block parties, community gardens, and a lively culinary scene. Dough Doughnuts, anyone? The ever-changing neighborhood offers the best of what’s old and new, making it a place worthy of settling down and staying for a while. See how Sweeten renovators did just that and made Bed-Stuy home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32893 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-05-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, living room, brownstone" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having their hearts set on a Brooklyn brownstone led <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellamy and Zak</a> to a two-family home in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Restricted by the home’s layout and their budget, the couple focused on the structural changes that would most impact the flow. They flipped the house to make the top two floors the owner’s duplex and renovated the garden floor as the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-rental-in-a-brownstone-gets-fashionable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rental property</a>. Removing doors in the main entryway instantly opened up the space and created a larger living area. Two walls were torn down to expose the full length of the home—and two mismatched walls—which led to repointing and experimenting with painting techniques.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24342 mb-0 size-chrono" title="ktichen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, kitchen, renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/teacher-writes-lesson-kitchen-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ursula</a> loved almost everything about her recently converted two-bedroom condo—except the kitchen. Between the dark mahogany cabinets and flooring, the room felt anything but open. The space was revamped with white glossy cabinets, a geometric backsplash, and a sleek hood where the microwave used to be. Ursula and her Sweeten contractor got strategic when it came to storage: the new island featured three drawers for silverware, cutlery, and dishes, and they made the most of an underutilized area next to the oven by installing a pull-out spice rack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29885 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-11-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedforod-Stuyvesant, living room, brownstone" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It all came down to location during <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marsha and Adam’s </a>house hunt for their family. They searched across Brooklyn and at one point, New Jersey, before realizing the borough was the place for them. The two-family home they finally found in Bedford-Stuyvesant offered the space and light they were looking for, and just had a “good feeling about it.” A full renovation proved necessary to bring the 2,000-square-foot townhouse up to snuff. Taking inspiration from their #1 must-have—white oak floors—the couple set out to create a simple, clean vibe to carry throughout the home, including the all-white kitchen. The rest of the project centered on knocking down walls to open the living room, dining area, and kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_KV_Yard-03-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20478 size-chrono" title="backyard" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_KV_Yard-03-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn backyard, renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>Every New Yorker’s dream? An outdoor space to call their own. Inspired by the gardens of Mexico and Brazil, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-expert-santiago/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K.V. Harper</a> set out to turn the once unusable outdoor space behind her two-bedroom Bedford-Stuyvesant duplex into a lush retreat for entertaining. A framed cedar fence became the defining element of the oasis, encompassing different seating areas and gardening plots. Another fun bonus: The crew found bluestone during the demolition and repurposed it to build out a pathway leading to the yard.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry</a> weren’t expecting a gut renovation when they purchased their single-family home in the Bedford Historic District. While trying to sort out the mechanicals and ductwork, however, they came to the realization starting from scratch would be more efficient overall. To build a home that would grow with them over time, accommodate guests, and most importantly meet their day-to-day needs as a family, they set priorities. For him: the bells and whistles necessary to create a smart home, and for her, the flow and design crucial to making the house fit their lifestyle. The result? A welcoming, open home thoughtful of visiting and family friends. Seriously, the guest room was the first one ready!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Brooklyn couple renovate a rental unit for a warm welcome</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Bellamy, an executive at The GAP, and Zak, a senior environmental scientist, took their 119-year old Bed-Stuy brownstone and turned it on its head by flipping the way it was previously used. The new configuration puts the couple at the top of the building in a cozy duplex with a single-story rental on the garden level. To achieve this, they carefully planned their renovation budget to be allocated between the two living spaces. (See how they transformed the two floors <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of their own home here</a>.) They came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, to update the bathroom, add sliding doors, and create a new entrance for a private, light-filled rental unit. </em></p>

</a>Guest post by Bed-Stuy homeowner Bellamy</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I owned a one-bedroom condo in Bedford-Stuyvesant, but when Zak and I moved in together we wanted a larger space for ourselves. So we moved out and rented for two years, which gave us the flexibility to take our time buying and not rush the search process. It worked in our favor since it took us almost eight months to find and purchase a home. We were specifically looking for a two-family house where we would be able to rent out a portion of the house to supplement the mortgage.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We found this perfect three-story brownstone in Bed-Stuy—2,400 square feet, about 800 per floor. It was built in 1899, and when we found it, there was a lower duplex and a top floor rental. We wanted to flip that scenario and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten. With help from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovated the top two floors</a> for ourselves and gave the rental a facelift.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33377 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental_Before0306-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Bellamy Grindl Townhouse-Rental_Before03+06" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" title="light-brown-barn-door" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33330 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-44-723x482.jpg" alt="light brown barn door and room with white and blue walls and vinyl floor after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-44-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-44-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-44-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-44-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-44.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33324" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-36-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Bellamy Grindl Townhouse-Rental-36" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were much tighter on our budget in the rental since we had spent the bulk of our money on our personal living space. The mantra was, “Make it simple, functional, and durable.” I wanted to add natural light and brighten the space and make sure there was complete privacy between our living space and the rental unit. A separate stairwell would have had to be created if the rental stayed on the third floor, and we&#8217;d lose a lot of existing footprint. By making our home on the top two floors and relocating the rental to the garden-level, we not only kept the square footage but it turned out to be the easiest and least expensive option.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first thing we did was close off access—which was a set of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French doors</a>—to the stairway going from the first floor and on up to our living space. This gave us an open area to create a coat closet when you walk into the rental unit. I loved that my contractor suggested pushing the coat closet as far back as we could which would otherwise have been wasted space inside the rental. Instead, the entire hallway now serves as storage space for Zak and I and a way to our basement that only we can access.</p>
<blockquote><p>We did spend the majority of our budget in our living space. But I am happy with the areas we chose to upgrade in the rental.</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33332 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental_Before04-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Bellamy Grindl Townhouse-Rental_Before04" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33325" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-37-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Bellamy Grindl Townhouse-Rental-37" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once our contractor realized that Zak and I were quite handy, we were able to figure out what we could do versus what we should leave to the professionals. Overall, it was all about repurposing what we had. I did a fun tie-dye paint effect over the bed. I’d read online about how to transform a large wall with little cost using a sample can of Behr interior acrylic eggshell paint; it cost about $3. I diluted the paint with water until it was the consistency I wanted and then crisscrossed it over the wall until it was the desired effect. Zak and I did the kitchen ourselves, painting the cabinets, tiling the backsplash, grouting, and putting in new countertops. We also installed the sliding barn doors. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bathroom</a> was left to the professionals!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33334 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental_Before02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Bellamy Grindl Townhouse-Rental_Before02" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33326" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-Rental-40-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Bellamy Grindl Townhouse-Rental-40" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In closing off the basement, we had to relocate the bathroom entrance and seal off a doorway in the kitchen. With the added wall space, we fit a small eat-in nook in the kitchen. The other thing that needed attention in the rental was an awful bathroom. We replaced everything in there. It completely changed the space and made it feel more modern and updated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the house was built in 1899, we thought we might find some interesting details, but, unfortunately, all the character was stripped prior to us buying the house. Everything had probably been replaced in the past 15 years. Because we were adding walls, it was hard to stay consistent with the original molding, so to stay on budget, we opted for the least expensive four-inch <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">base molding</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was absolutely worth renovating. We did spend the majority of our budget in our own living space, but I am happy with the areas we chose to upgrade in the rental. The new flow gives us both privacy, we all gained extra storage space, and we&#8217;ve received great feedback on what we&#8217;ve put together.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Marsha and Adam searched long and hard for almost two years before they found the townhouse that would become their family home in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The pair—she, the CFO of a division at Siemens, and he, a manager of software development at Spotify—looked all over the borough, and even ventured into New Jersey before realizing that Brooklyn was where they needed to be. They found a brick two-family home that needed a lot of work, but the couple had a good feeling about it. It was “sunny, just the right size, and of course, within our budget,” says Marsha. Having lived for a while in a 720-square-foot Park Slope apartment with their two daughters, Sophie and Mila, they were excited for all the new space—just over 2,000 square feet on three floors, plus a basement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While the duo knew that they needed to gut the townhouse, the renovation and total timeline stretched across a year and a half. They moved into the home in the summer of 2015, pre-renovation, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors. They were matched with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect</a>, who worked with them on the plans for the renovation lasting close to a year. (A possible relocation to North Carolina for work delayed the project for three months, just as construction was about to commence.) Once the demolition began, the family of four moved into the garden apartment and camped out there for about half a year, until the work in the upstairs duplex was completed in December 2016.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The first must-have on the couple’s list was white oak floors. The rest of the design took inspiration from the simplicity of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardwood</a>. For the kitchen, Marsha and Adam decided on an all-white color palette, an unfussy, modern look inspired while scouring Pinterest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the main floor of the duplex (the second floor of the house), the couple knocked down the walls that chopped up the spaces, so that the living room, dining space, and kitchen were all connected as one open room. A hallway, which took up precious space, was removed, while a full bath was converted to a powder room (with a fun <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patterned tile floor</a>!) all to give more square footage to the kitchen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Working within a limited amount of space, their Sweeten architect came up with two solutions that would maximize the function and beauty of the kitchen, which faced the back of the house. She suggested that they add another window to the rear wall, and remove a non-functioning fireplace that was causing an awkward flow. The revised layout featured an L-shaped white Caesarstone countertop and white ceiling-height Shaker-style cabinets, as well as a new island. A large <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen pantry</a> held the recycling and appliances from view. A marble hex-tile backsplash added some variation while furthering the theme of modern simplicity. Three simple wood-clad steps lead to a deck and down to the backyard.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Each of the three bedrooms were <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/skim-coating-in-5-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coated</a> and painted in Benjamin Moore Super White, a perfect backdrop to the pops of color that the girls added to their rooms. The resulting home is modern yet warm and allows the couple’s mid-century modern-inspired furnishings, lighting, and art to take center stage.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-23.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29904 size-chrono" title="hallway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-23-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation Brooklyn" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-18.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29903 mb-0 size-chrono" title="washer/dryer closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-18.gif" alt="renovation Brooklyn" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the top floor of the duplex, the floor plan remained mostly the same, with a few minor changes. The hallway was widened for a more spacious feel. The two smaller bedrooms were evened out so that both Sophie and Mila would have similarly-sized rooms, and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer/dryer closet</a> was created so that they wouldn’t have to “schlep laundry up and down the stairs.” The original staircases were in terrible condition and a priority to be replaced. They now feature clean vertical lines—white posts framed by straight wooden rails that echo the white oak floors.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29906 size-chrono" title="basement landing" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation Brooklyn" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Marsha and Adam have put away the paint cans, they reflected on what was most difficult about the renovation: “The biggest challenge was living in a construction zone for five months,&#8221; the couple agrees. &#8220;It was tight, dusty, and messy. But it was a great way to keep track of the progress and make sure everything was being done as we expected. [Another] challenge was keeping our wish list reasonable. It is so easy to spiral out of control and decide you want every square inch renovated.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They were glad to have a Sweeten architect by their side. “The team was pleasant and easy to work with. I still can&#8217;t believe how great our experience was considering we were gutting our house. The key is communication, and we all worked very well together. Our advice is to find people who are easy to communicate with, and who have worked together in the past. When people know each other, they can more easily deal with issues that come up.” What do they love most about their new home? For Marsha, it was the sunny kitchen and backyard. And according to the children: all of it. &#8220;I think they truly love the house,&#8221; says their mother.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, they also wanted to share this nugget of wisdom: “Paying more for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproofing</a> the bathroom (so you don&#8217;t hear anything from your bedroom) is worth every penny. We really appreciated our Sweeten architect telling us that we ‘needed’ those more expensive items—she was right.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Big personality comes home with a trough sink and a wine fridge—under the stairs</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27222 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Homeowners Ed and Alicia with their dog, Roxy" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After Roxy, a rescued Rhodesian ridgeback, joined their household, Alicia and Ed realized “a little more space in a laid-back neighborhood” would be a better fit for the family of three than Manhattan, where they were currently living. They set their sights on a 1,400-square-foot garden duplex in a Park Slope brownstone. They fell in love with the building, which had been converted to condos by a developer about a decade ago. Despite the high-end finishes that were chosen at that time, there were issues that had developed in the interim. The couple also wanted to bring the renovations in line with their tastes, and in a style more befitting a building dating from the turn of the last century. As Alicia put it, “We really just wanted to make the place something we loved coming home to at the end of each day. What we had wasn’t awful, but it wasn’t terribly practical either<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>we had mismatched countertops, cracked tiles in the bathroom, a lack of counter space in the master bath, and most importantly, no space in the fridge to store our wine. The place just lacked the ‘wow’ you would expect from a building this pretty.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Before-Watermarked.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27245 size-chrono" title="before: kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Before-Watermarked-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27226 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27224 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached out to Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors—for <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a>. For the couple&#8217;s custom kitchen renovation, Christina, their Sweeten Planner, was present at regular site visits and contractor meetings, providing detailed progress reports. Initially, the couple intended to focus their time and money on the kitchen. Instead, they also updated the guest and master bathrooms executing an overall vision<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>“a muted, classic design with a modern twist.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, this meant replacing the mismatched countertops as well as the cabinet fronts, and creatively finding space for a built-in wine fridge. Ed and Alicia knew that when the kitchen was renovated a decade ago the developer had used top-of-the-line materials, from custom Italian cabinetry to Viking, Miele, and Liebherr appliances; the space didn’t need a gut, simply a refresh. The downside of the custom Italian kitchen, however, was that none of the cabinetry was standard-sized. Refacing was a custom job, pushing out timelines, but it meant they could keep all the existing built-in shelving and customized organization that would have been extremely expensive to replace. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Countertops</a> resembling marble from Caesarstone unified the space and were chosen for their hardiness and durability. Ed had always wanted waterfall-edge countertops, which completed the look perfectly.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27225 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27227 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Chalkboard wall and wine fridge under the stairs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They had hoped to replace a smaller-than-usual refrigerator, as well as add a wine fridge. But the floor plan wouldn’t afford them the space for a larger unit, so they focused on adding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wine fridge</a> instead. Working with their Sweeten contractor, Ed and Alicia poked exploratory holes in the drywall underneath their stairs. Happily, they discovered that a 36-bottle dual zone wine fridge would fit in the space without making any structural changes. “It&#8217;s a luxury you would never think you could have in New York. We painted the surrounding wall with chalkboard paint<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>it’s a great way to leave notes for each other, plan out our grocery list, and try out some amateur artwork,” they said. &#8220;As a bonus, we found the current kitchen fridge is more than large enough for our needs.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The downstairs bathroom was next on the list<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>it already had a great soaking tub, but the vanity and medicine cabinet were outdated. The tiles, too, were showing their age. Alicia had always loved the feel of a traditional New York City bathroom<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>penny tile floors, subway tile, and a classic black-and-white color palette. They replaced the sink with a trough style: “There was debate whether the sink would be too large, but after lots of measuring and imagining how close it would be to someone using the shower or toilet, we decided to do it. We are so glad we did. It is a perfect fit. We also went for the matching faucets and soap dish.” Having forgone <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> under the new sink, they added a small shelf and a 1940s American Red Cross medicine cabinet (found online in Bulgaria!). The large closet just outside of the bathroom made up for the limited storage. Lastly, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-hung-toilets-look-behind-scenes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall-hung toilet</a> was a lot of trouble to install, but ultimately worth the effort, since it’s incredibly easy to keep clean and makes the room feel larger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Living_Room_During-Watermarked-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27469 size-chrono" title="during: dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Living_Room_During-Watermarked-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27228 mb-0 size-chrono" title="exposed brick wall in the dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the renovation of the downstairs bath, the contractor discovered that there was preserved exposed brick along one wall. They hoped that the brick was in the same condition a few feet away in the living room, and asked the contractor to rip down the sheetrock where their dining table would sit. “It turns out we were in luck. The brick looked wonderful, and though we had to unexpectedly reroute some electrical cables and find matching oak to patch up the flooring, it was worth all of the expense and impact on the timeline.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27234 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-14-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27233 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom shower and tub" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-13-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the couple also decided to renovate the master bathroom upstairs. (One of the pluses of living through your renovation is that you can figure out what else needs work while the contractor is on-site!) Since Alicia and Ed moved in while the renovation was still ongoing, they lived with the space for a while and found the bath to be unsuitable in many ways. “The overhead lighting was terrible, and the illuminated mirror died the day after we closed on the apartment. There was the complete lack of shelf space for us to set things down while getting ready, and the leaking pipework rendered the vanity useless for storage. The space really felt unloved.&#8221; To give the room a facelift without breaking the budget, they kept the large soaking tub (same as the one downstairs), the flooring, and toilet. A new white shaker vanity with a marble countertop provided ample storage while an illuminated medicine cabinet and built-in LED lights lit up the room. Adding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass panel</a> in place of the old shower curtain opened the space up. Lastly, a herringbone wallpaper from Ferm Living took the master bath to the next level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They made the home “<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-appliances-worth-hype/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smarter</a>,” by adding outlets in convenient locations for their <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sonos</a> sound system, converting regular to USB outlets where appropriate, adding a video intercom, and installing a full <a href="https://nest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nest</a> thermostat and smoke detector system. Now, they can control the temperature via Amazon Echo (thanks, Alexa!) and ensure that the apartment is a comfortable temperature for Roxy while they are away.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Stairs-During.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27241 mb-0 size-chrono" title="during: Roxy on the stairs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Stairs-During-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="During" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although they’d hoped to finish the renovations prior to their move-in date, they ended up <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living through the entire renovation</a>, which lasted four weeks from beginning to end. The toughest part, according to Alicia and Ed, was keeping Roxy out of trouble. (See above.) Their advice to future renovators? “Find a contractor you trust, and take their advice on what things would work well and what to avoid. We used tools like Pinterest, the Sweeten blog, and other online tools to get ideas. Also, if you have space, try to keep some spare materials once you have completed your renovation. We spent a long time trying to find a flooring that matched our current style to patch in around the exposed brick wall. We decided to buy an extra pack this time and store it in our basement in case of emergency. The same thing with all the tile. You never know what could happen in the future<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>for a few hundred dollars, it is worth the investment and peace of mind!”</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s begin with the impetus for the whole move: our little roommate, Nacho. As far as roommates go, this one is not so bad. He’s demanding and he struggles to clean up after himself, but man oh man, do we love this guy. We wanted to move into a home to give him a better sense of what it means to grow up in a community: to plant flowers in the tree pits with our neighbors, to attend block association meetings (where he gets to call the meeting to order), to hang on the stoop, meet neighbors and observe street life, and to have the space to run around and be a kid.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is so much I miss about apartment living. I’m a total city brat, but to see Nacho lose it when he hears birds outside or sees a squirrel running around the backyard is pretty darn amazing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-42.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25768" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-42.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-42-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-42-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-42-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">New life for the brownstone bedrooms</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nacho&#8217;s playroom is separated by sliding doors from a small bedroom where he sleeps. At some point, Nacho may move to the playroom, or we may convert the small bedroom to another guest bedroom or office or a nursery—who knows? Point is, I like the flexibility with the two joined yet separate spaces.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/bedroom-storage-style-renovation-ideas/"><span class="s2">love the master bedroom</span></a>. It’s a good lesson on what paint can do for a room. This house taught me to go dark, and to appreciate the power of the color black. The entire room got new moldings and trim, and the original gross color on the walls was removed.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span>&#8220;When we realized we had this little bit of extra space in our master bedroom suite, we quickly redesigned the bathroom&#8230;&#8221;</span>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding character with the color black</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This Brooklyn brownstone seemed to call for darker colors. Interestingly, the black paint doesn’t make the spaces feel dark or small. It makes our stairs feel like a real feature, it keeps the master bath from feeling like a blah condo bathroom, and it brings out the moldings and woodwork in our master bedroom. All of the rooms look elegant and uncluttered without feeling too stark. I’m a big fan. The colors also looked really different on walls versus woodwork and depending on how the light hit it. I had to choose between 15 different shades of black.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25776" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A luxury bathroom comes to life</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The master bathroom is cool. The whole bathroom started out with the wall-mounted faucet, and I designed the rest of the bathroom around it. I love the black tile wall and the concrete and wood vanity. Our architect created great drawings for the concrete guys and carpenter to use for the vanity and countertop. We saved a bit by using a beautiful teak veneer rather than solid teak.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Design around who you are and how you behave. I realized that I was often late in the mornings because Larry would take forever in the bathroom. When we realized we had this little bit of extra space in our master bedroom suite, we quickly redesigned the bathroom, giving ourselves a long vanity with a single sink (I’d rather have more counter space), and created this little toilet room with its own sink.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-33.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25779" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-33.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-33-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-33-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-33-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The well-located laundry room</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Let’s get to the Real Housewives of Brooklyn—all we ever wanted was a laundry room that wasn’t tucked away in a creepy 200-year-old basement. After the dining room, this might be my favorite room in the house. I think that architecture directs behavior. When the laundry room is conveniently located, everyone does their laundry in a timely manner. It’s less about a love of doing laundry, which I obviously hate doing, and more about having a great appreciation for setting up a space where it can be done efficiently and where towels and sheets can be stored right away after folding.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-19.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25784" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-19-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-19-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-19-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A man cave full of light</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Larry was so excited to have his own office—formerly a bathroom—and couldn’t be happier with the setup. Everything is within arm’s reach, and there is enough built-in storage for his books and files. When we are running around in the house, he can shut the sliding doors and have his cave, while still allowing light in from the skylights because of the lovely <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/transom-windows-let-the-light-in/"><span class="s2">transom windows we built in</span></a>. Our architect did a great job with the layout upstairs to ensure maximum light.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-21.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25785" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-21.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-21-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-21-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-21-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our lounge is outside of Larry’s office, and it’s our Friday night hangout. At the end of every week, we like to tuck Nacho into bed and crawl on the couch to watch a movie. We’ve never made it past the first 15 minutes without falling asleep. Nevertheless, we love having a space just for us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Larry likes having the doors to his office open and being able to watch a game while he works late into the night. The ability to open his office up to the lounge allows a lot of flexibility in the space, both now and in the future. We love that there’s no door to the lounge; it means stepping into a very open space as soon as you get to the top of the stairs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m going to acknowledge that we are fortunate as New Yorkers to be able to afford and renovate this Brooklyn brownstone. It allowed us access to capital, insurance, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/mortgage-101-everything-need-home-loans/"><span class="s2">loans</span></a> not available to most of our neighbors who were in fact systematically denied loans. I am aware that other people were forced to sell their homes for nothing. So while I’m happy to talk about tile, we are grateful for the choices we have been afforded in life, which got us to the point where our fights are about where to put a bathtub. Speaking of which…we didn’t get a bathtub. It’s just one of a million tiny regrets and shoulda-woulda’s that are unavoidable in this process.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you to Nazli, Larry, and Nacho for generously sharing your Brooklyn brownstone!</i></span></p>

<p><strong>Sweeten&#8217;s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to our first installment of a series in which I hope to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating. We hear your questions every day and work happily to bring you answers through our team and blog. Whether you&#8217;re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings a new set of circumstances and new queries with it. Feel free to email me at JBrownhill@sweeten.com. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll even include questions that I get asked most often—even at cocktail parties!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, our question is about brownstones, and if this topic interests you, be sure to check out Part 1 of Nazli&#8217;s post on her and her husband Larry&#8217;s full gut four-story townhouse reno, a story filled with helpful insights and a refreshingly candid take on their experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>QUESTION: What should homeowners keep in mind before jumping into a brownstone renovation?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN:</strong> I think most people get really excited about the interiors, especially as New Yorkers. We’re used to mostly having apartments or spaces where we are pretty much focused only on the interior. But the big change comes when you go from a regular apartment renovation to a brownstone renovation or an actual piece of property, and you’re still tempted to focus on the interiors. After all, that’s where it’s going to be fun&#8230;that’s where you’re going to live.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I highly recommend people fall in love with all the details of their roof, and all the details of their basement—places where apartment dwellers usually rely on a super and don&#8217;t ever have to worry. So when you’re thinking about a brownstone renovation, really look at the integrity of the roof and the integrity of the basement. Those are the areas you want to get right before you even start on the interiors. Every time it rains, you don&#8217;t want your heart skipping a beat wondering if your roof is leaking. Or if it&#8217;s raining hard, you don&#8217;t want to be stressed out worrying, &#8220;Oh my god, is my basement flooding?&#8221; So fall in love with the roof and the basement. Because that’s really the difference. Yes, you’re getting a ton more space, and yes, you’re getting a backyard, but start at the top and the bottom.</p>

<p>Jerry and Janet&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">historic brownstone</a> needed major work, including a facelift of the building&#8217;s exterior, so they turned to a gut renovation with the goal of creating the perfect mix of old and new.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Diving into a multi-story Brooklyn brownstone renovation, welcoming spaces like the foyer, guest bedroom, and bath get the luxe treatment for friends and family</span></h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Today’s before and after kicks off a three-part series on a Brooklyn brownstone gut renovation in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. In 2015, Nazli and Larry bought a four-story derelict townhouse and set out to create a home for themselves and their son Nacho. With refreshing honesty on topics ranging from marital disagreement to aging foresight, Nazli shares the behind-the-scenes process of decision-making and what it means to renovate for real life, beyond the photo shoot. The couple—she&#8217;s a consultant for government affairs and he is a broker—envisioned the house as an inviting space for their extended community of family and friends—a home away from home. Read on for Nazli’s take on their plans for the new townhouse, and the full reveal of their guest suite on the second floor. Fittingly, for a family that loves to host, it was the first room finished and ready for occupancy!</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We purchased our home in the <a href="https://www.brownstoner.com/history/bedford-historic-district-approved-by-landmarks-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newly landmarked</a> Bedford Historic District. It was a single-family brownstone, roughly 4,000 square feet, which we converted into a two-family home with a garden rental and a triplex for ourselves. The home was built in 1890 by Bedford-Stuyvesant architect Montrose Morris, who also built the nearby Kelly Mansion. He built many of the premier properties for wealthy families of the time, though the four townhouses he built on our street were apparently more of an exercise in creating middle-class lodging. Our home was uninhabitable at the time of purchase, truly<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no heat, no working bathrooms or kitchen, and just…not in good shape. There were original but defunct fireplaces, beautifully preserved paneling and plaster work on the walls, as well as some stained-glass windows (a happy surprise)<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>but no other details remained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We certainly did not go into our renovation thinking that it would be a gut—we couldn’t afford it and we didn’t think it would be necessary. But while attempting to figure out the mechanicals and ductwork, it quickly became apparent that it would be more efficient to take down all the crumbling walls and start from scratch. It wouldn’t be so much more expensive since the electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems could be done anew, rather than trying to trace them up 130-year-old walls. There was also so much water damage throughout the house that none of the original flooring could be preserved. The house was a mess.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our goals were to meet the basic needs of our family, and tick items off our dream list. My basic vision of a home is a giant kitchen with some other rooms arranged nearby for whatever it is people do outside of a kitchen. Larry was really looking forward to having his own private office, which would allow him to work from home more often and spend more time with our son, Nacho. Our child only cares about fans, so we made sure we had a ceiling fan for him to play with (kidding). Collectively, we love to entertain, so we wanted to make sure we had plenty of space for guests and could host for a while without it feeling like a strain. We also knew that as we and our families aged, our needs would be different, and wanted flexibility in how our spaces were configured to allow for changing needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband and I disagreed on most decisions (seriously, renovation is not for the faint-hearted), but there was also a really nice division of labor around what our priorities were. I could care less about the bells and whistles of a “smart” home, but my husband spent a lot of time and effort getting the house wired up on Nest thermostats, security systems, and a Sonos sound system, etc. It’s totally amazing to be able to hear music throughout the house, or turn the heat on remotely and come home to a warm home after a few days away. On the other hand, I really care about the flow of space and a house design that makes it easy to clean and maintain. I thought a lot about our storage options and made a million mock-ups of the kitchen and what each cabinet should be used for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of how we imagined the home, I definitely pictured a more modern space than what we have, but we realized pretty quickly that the house, even with the few remaining details, called for a different type of treatment. Townhouses are tough: they are long and narrow and lighting is always tricky, and I think we both realized if we wanted an ultra-modern design we should have looked at a different type of property. We wanted to honor the feel of this Brooklyn brownstone and preserve as much of the plasterwork and recreate as much of the molding without feeling closed in—the way that many of the more traditional townhouses made us feel. Certainly, we wanted a design that felt as open as possible, but I’m a stickler for storage and we are not minimalists, so real-life storage solutions were key. This meant large closets in every room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> where possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were lucky enough <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to find</a> our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect through Sweeten</a> and we really wanted her to come on to do drawings and filings because our contractor, who was also my husband’s best friend, really wanted design as he went along. The goal was to create a beautiful space that was flexible to changing tastes. I view the house, beyond some very bold choices in some of the rooms, as a really great blank canvas for great furniture and our art collection. I didn’t want too much millwork or details that would keep the house stuck in one genre forever. Both for ourselves and our changing needs and tastes and for future owners of the home, it’s nice to be able to create a totally different look and feel in the future without having to do major construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s start with the foyer, which is a work in process. I love that when you enter the home, you see the entire floor. The staircase looks so lovely and grand, especially with the black paint and the landing at the bottom of the stairs to emphasize the grandeur of the steps. There was a crazy wood panel fracture with a mirror at the bottom of the stairs but we all thought it was bulky and awkward and it didn&#8217;t seem to be original to the rest of the stairwell. Our architect convinced us (Larry) to get rid of it and our contractor convinced us to rip up that whole wall and expose the brick. I love the sneak peek into the original brick, and how it grounds the space from the frou-frou antique-looking chandelier and the stained glass. I loved using the same ceramic tile from the dining room in the entry vestibule and again—it was all brought together so beautifully by <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painting</a> all of it black.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Like all good Iranians, I made sure the guest room was the first one in the house that was set up, furnished, and made available for use. Guests are sacred in our culture and we started having house guests after the first night in our house, and for about three months straight afterward. I think Larry takes more of an American’s tact towards house guests…like fish, they start to stink after three days. But having them on their own floor with their own bathroom certainly makes it easy to have folks around. Oh, how I love having a guest room. Basically, if you paint any room Benjamin Moore Chelsea Gray, it will be close to perfect. I had a different idea about how this room would look but then I inherited this terrible rug from my father’s house in Tehran and had to redo all the bedding to go with the odd mix of muted colors. I love Persian rugs, don’t get me wrong<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>walking on bare floors isn’t my taste. But we followed the rules for a perfect guest room: make sure the bed is comfy, that the closets are empty so guests can use them for their own stuff, and provide a work desk (so you can hold your best friends hostage for weeks at a time in your home, even if they insist they have to go back to LA to “work”).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This guest bathroom is so delightfully boring that I fall asleep looking at its soothing tones. I wish I pushed harder for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moroccan tiles</a> in here. I think the floors we used, which basically mimic the look and feel of concrete, wash the whole room out. Our architect used these floors in a hotel project and I really dug them; they were cheap and cool, but always remember the scale of a home project versus a commercial project. What may look like a great feature in a larger space may not work in a smaller venue. I usually have a Persian rug down on this floor which gives the room some warmth and life. If you are ever unhappy with the flooring, put a rug on it! I can’t say enough about how much I love these subway tiles though<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>they are just varied enough to give them a real handmade look rather than the flat subway tiles we usually see. They come in a gorgeous gray and black as well<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>I failed in not using them in more spots throughout the house; that may be a future project. I love the shower as well, we made it nice and big so that Nacho could have fun in there. We also built a large bench along it with a grip bar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our moms visit often, and I find bathtubs to be really dangerous for the senior citizen crowd. We felt good about having a step-in shower and adding features that would make it safe for both Nacho and the grandmas. It’s lovely having the windows in the bathrooms after years of using interior bathrooms with poor ventilation, though we haven’t figured out a good solution for the wood window trim, which is constantly getting wet and will probably crack or mold in the future. I also highly recommend an integrated sink when you have filthy toddlers—makes clean-up so much easier. This was the top half of a vanity and sink combo I bought. We ended up hating the vanity, so I just had our contractor make us a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinet</a>, which is lovely.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>A hunt for more space led Tina Ladd and her husband, Fletcher, from a one-bedroom on Manhattan’s Upper West Side to a garden duplex in a Cobble Hill brownstone. As an architect, Tina was thrilled to be able to customize their new home but was up against an urgent deadline: the imminent birth of the couple’s first child. The transformation was so remarkable, we&#8217;re telling the story in two parts, starting with the parlor. </i></span><span class="s1"><i>Here’s part one of Tina’s vision for the family home—and how she went into labor on moving day! </i></span></p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Guest post by Tina in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Coming from a one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side, we were eager to upsize to a two-bedroom and create a home for our expanding family. We had been looking at listings up and down Manhattan and in a couple of Brooklyn neighborhoods before we found out we were expecting a baby. Four months into the pregnancy (and into intensifying nesting instincts), we went into contract on a duplex in a historic Brooklyn townhouse. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">While we would have been happy with a turn-key apartment, we were both open to renovation work so I could exercise my skill set as an architect and design a more tailored home for our family. With the advantage of a network of design professionals and general construction knowledge, we knew we could take on an appropriately sized project. As we approached a fixed deadline—the due date—we eliminated any options that would require significant structural, electrical, or plumbing work. This would not only cut down on a construction timeline, but it would also eliminate the lengthy review process of obtaining permits from the Department of Buildings and the Landmark Preservation Commission.</span></p>

<p class="p5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s2">As an architect, I didn’t want a cookie-cutter apartment; luckily, my husband, Fletcher, was supportive in my pursuit of something unique. </span>When we attended the open house for our apartment, we were drawn to the high ceilings and 10-foot windows framing the living room. The sun-filled living space was located on the entry parlor level of the townhouse (about five feet above street level), with views directly out to the beautiful brownstone street. The bedrooms were located on the garden level, one floor below. While the 1,200 sq. ft, two-bedroom space checked many boxes on our list, we felt a few changes were needed to turn it into the home we were searching for. The living space was in good shape, and some of it was even recently renovated. However, the kitchen was small and closed-off. Unlike the parlor floor with tall ceilings, the lower, garden level had very low ceilings and felt like a basement. <span class="s2">The previous owners had added some modern touches, and while we both prefer the minimalist aesthetic in certain types of projects, we knew bringing back some familiar character would help make the historic apartment feel more inviting.</span></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Due to the seller’s terms for a closing date, we were in contract for nearly three months, pushing a tighter deadline. In order to be sure we could hit the ground running with construction upon closing, we discussed major design decisions, and I completed drawings for our anticipated work before meeting with contractors, and ahead of our closing date. At first, we had planned to open the kitchen and re-tile the bathrooms. By the time we were meeting with contractors, our list expanded to include refinishing the floors, adding molding/casing, and replacing all the interior doors. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I <span class="s3"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned to Sweeten</a></span> to find a contractor after seeing an ad during Open House NYC, my favorite Sunday morning TV show. We were matched with three general contractors and decided to move forward with the <span class="s3"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> who best understood our vision and could</span> help us strategically meet our goals. He laid out a six-week timeline—a more ambitious schedule than we had anticipated! To meet our budget, we chose to supply the materials and fixtures, taking advantage of my design industry discounts.</span></p>

<p class="p6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Our first goal with the apartment was to create an open </span><span class="s4">kitchen</span><span class="s1">. The existing kitchen was separated from the living room by a floating, non-structural wall. By removing the wall and turning the corner with new cabinets, we could transform the space from a narrow galley-style kitchen to an open L- shape with an island.</span></p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">From the first time we saw the space, I envisioned a transitional-style kitchen with navy blue <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a>. I considered both Ikea cabinets with custom fronts, as well as standard semi-custom options. In my first walk-through with the contractor, he suggested a custom cabinet maker that could execute my vision in a more cost-effective way than semi-custom options from a big-box store. Initially, custom cabinets were not in our budget. We were able to construct a kitchen perfectly fit for the space, maximizing storage vertically. We ended up choosing a shaker-style in Newburyport Blue. Simple, budget-friendly 2&#215;8 subway tile in white from Nemo Tile and white Frosty Carrina from Caesarstone allowed the color of the cabinets to really pop. We installed under-cabinet outlet strips and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a>, which added a level of sophistication.</span></p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The previous owners had installed top-of-the-line appliances—a Sub-Zero refrigerator, Miele dishwasher, Wolf range, and stove. Because we chose to keep the appliances, we designed around them. This was one advantage of a totally custom kitchen. We wanted a true <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exhaust hood</a> for the Wolf range with higher CFM (cubic feet per minute &#8211; a measure of the volume of air that moves heat, odor, moisture, and smoke per minute while cooking) capabilities than a typical over-the-range microwave venting system. The kitchen design didn’t really allow for an alternate microwave location, so we concealed it behind pocket doors in the island. The Sub-Zero refrigerator also impacted our design. The refrigerator door opened away from the cook and prep space in our new layout. Since the Sub-Zero design does not accommodate switching the door hinge side, the island footprint was rotated and narrowed from what we had originally planned in order to provide comfortable clearance.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-Before-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23544 size-chrono" title="duplex renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-Before-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-Before-06" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-Before-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-Before-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-Before-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-Before-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23545 mb-0 size-chrono" title="duplex renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-01" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing powder room design was very modern. To bring a more transitional feel marrying both traditional and contemporary elements into the bath, we replaced the tile, vanity mirrors and light fixtures for a more classic aesthetic. For the flooring, we chose Nemo’s Fluid basketweave marble mosaic; I love this pattern that was so common in prewar homes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, we got to work on the master bath and bedrooms which are located in the semi-subterranean lower level—and with shorter ceilings. Making the space brighter and restoring historic charm was the goal.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ever since our <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/site-visit-brooklyn-brownstone-gut-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">construction visits</a> at the end of last year, we&#8217;ve been anticipating our return to Ditmas Park to see this completed first floor gut renovation, built by a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368">Sweeten member</a>. The 1000 sqft, Brownstone home had not been updated in 40 years before AMC was brought in to transform the heavily compartmentalized living spaces of the first floor into an open, functional, and modern family home. The team at AMC had their work cut out for them, beginning with asbestos abatement and structural reinforcing which was necessary to create the new, open plan. They also relocated plumbing, updated electrical, and integrated a new HVAC system before moving onto the modern finishes we see now.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-8075 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/theSweeten_AMC_DorchesterPlans-copy1.jpg" alt="full-floor-gut-renovation-brooklyn" width="560" height="460" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/theSweeten_AMC_DorchesterPlans-copy1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/theSweeten_AMC_DorchesterPlans-copy1-300x246.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />Before the renovation, the first floor was broken into tiny compartments, some of which had no natural light. The homeowners worked with architect &amp; new tS member, Slavica Novak Nikolic R.A. of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Urban Bond Creative,</a> to create a layout that works much better with their lifestyle; the open plan is ideal for entertaining and for keeping the family connected, even when working on separate things.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="photo-during-renovation"  class="wp-image-38666 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/03_-560x420.jpg" alt="demolished rooms during renovation" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/03_.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/03_-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Here&#8217;s a view from the former kitchen on our first visit during demolition. Once the non-load-bearing walls had been removed, we could already start to picture an open, modern home!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="dining-open-to-kitchen"  class="wp-image-38667 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3057-560x840.jpg" alt="dining room with chandelier and open to kitchen and living room and hardwood floors after renovation " width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3057.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3057-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />And here&#8217;s that same view now! In huge contrast to the cramped feeling of before, the first floor is now almost completely open. We love how the kitchen ceiling really seems to float overhead without any apparent vertical structure. Variations in ceiling height &#8212; where soffits have been used to conceal mechanical systems &#8212; also help to accentuate this lightness.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="built-in-butler-pantry-in-dining-room"  class="wp-image-38668 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3010-560x884.jpg" alt="dining room with chandelier and built in butler pantry and hardwood floors after renovation" width="560" height="884" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3010.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3010-190x300.jpg 190w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> The new dining area features a clever built-in buffet using ikea cabinetry &#8212; ikea&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ramsjo</a> system lets you alternate solid &amp; glass face panels, which works surprisingly well here to create the feeling of a custom unit. White walls here and throughout the space are painted in Benjamin Moore&#8217;s <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">china white</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="butcher-block-island-countertop"  class="wp-image-38669 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3044-560x373.jpg" alt="island with butcher block countertop and pendant lights and white kitchen cabinets after renovation" width="560" height="373" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3044.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3044-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The buffet&#8217;s solid-panel ramsjo cabinets continue into the kitchen, along with <a href="https://www.caesarstoneus.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caesarstone</a> countertops in &#8216;pure white.&#8217; A wood top for the island adds a bit of warmth to the space &#8212; and interestingly, this red wood, called African Padauk, will transition over time to a darker, purple/brown color due to light exposure. Niches built into the wall for display are another subtle but unique detail, adding even more originality to the space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="open-living-space-with-hardwood-floors"  class="wp-image-38670 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3060-560x809.jpg" alt="open living with tray ceilings and recessed and wall mounted lighting after renovation" width="560" height="809" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3060.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3060-208x300.jpg 208w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Next to the kitchen, this bathroom came as a pleasant surprise &#8212; it&#8217;s so fresh, with its modern fixtures, hardwood floors, and big pops of color &amp; pattern. Bright red paint was custom matched to this awesome <a href="https://www.flavorpaper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooklyn-themed toilet wallpaper</a>, designed by Beastie Boy Mike D &amp; Revolver NY, and printed &amp; sold by our friends at <a href="https://www.flavorpaper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flavorpaper</a> in Brooklyn.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="foyer-and-hallway-with-white-staircase"  class="wp-image-38673 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2018-12-13-at-10.48.46-PM-723x514.png" alt="hallway with hardwood floors and white staircase and foyer with entryway door after renovation" width="723" height="514" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2018-12-13-at-10.48.46-PM-723x514.png 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2018-12-13-at-10.48.46-PM-300x213.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2018-12-13-at-10.48.46-PM-600x426.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2018-12-13-at-10.48.46-PM.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /> The entry foyer received plenty of updates as well &#8212; one of the best is the custom milled front door which turned out beautifully! Underfoot, new white oak flooring runs throughout the whole first floor.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="living-room-with-tray-ceiling"  class="wp-image-38671 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2940-560x840.jpg" alt="living room with tray ceiling and recessed lighting and hardwood floors after renovation" width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2940.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2940-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />Looking back through the living space from the office &#8212; it&#8217;s so difficult now to imagine this space chopped into so many separate rooms!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="living-room-with-tray-ceiling"  class="wp-image-38672 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2960-560x840.jpg" alt="living room with tray ceiling and recessed lighting and hardwood floors after renovation" width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2960.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2960-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> For these happy homeowners, we&#8217;re sure it feels great to relax in their much improved home!</p>
<p>Many thanks to Alan Bowes &amp; his team at AMC, Slavica Nikolic, and to homeowners Sarah &amp; Mike.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This week we&#8217;re in the home of interior designer Katherine Hammond to check out the newest addition to her lovely Brooklyn Brownstone. After hearing about us from a friend, Katherine posted on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> seeking a contractor to build the <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/built-in-floating-desk-for-home-office-Prospect-Heights-Brooklyn-NY-awarded-to-contractor/510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom floating desk</a> she had designed. We matched her up with Nick Dillon of <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick Knacks Creative Interiors</a>, who worked with the designer to build and install her floating-concept desk. When the project was completed, Katherine reported that Nick was a &#8216;dream to work with&#8217; &#8211;and, as a bonus to us, she even ended up becoming a member of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> network with her company <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine Hammond Interiors</a>!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6011 size-full mb-24" title="01_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/01_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="418" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/01_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/01_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> </a>Here&#8217;s a shot of the space when <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/built-in-floating-desk-for-home-office-Prospect-Heights-Brooklyn-NY-awarded-to-contractor/510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine posted her project.</p>
<p><span id="more-6009"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6012 mb-24 size-full" title="02_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_theSweeten_floatingdesk-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />And here&#8217;s the transformed space! Katherine&#8217;s desk spans the length of the wall and is built-in for a floating effect, rather than being held up by vertical structural elements. Katherine explained that Nick advised her in the desk&#8217;s structural design, adding 3 thin steel brackets at different intervals across the span of the desk. In the center-back, the desk features a linear opening for cords so that items can be plugged in neatly and also moved from side to side. Beneath the opening, the cords are run through a hollow channel and straight to a power source which was relocated by NKCI for this purpose. These details allow Katherine can keep her desk as cord-free as possible!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6031 mb-24 size-full" title="03_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/03_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/03_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/03_theSweeten_floatingdesk1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Here&#8217;s Nick Dillon, owner of Nick Knacks Creative Interiors, on site during the desk installation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6014 size-full" title="04_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="418" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The desk was designed to be tucked away in the alcove behind this headboard. Like much of this Brooklyn Brownstone interior, the headboard, which doubles as a bookcase on the other side, was designed and built by Katherine and her father. Katherine consulted Francois Chambard of <a href="https://umproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UM Project</a>, an innovative furniture design co., for construction detailing to ensure a minimal look.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6015 mb-24 size-full" title="05_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/05_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/05_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/05_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> When Nick &amp; his crew came to install the desk (which they built off-site), Nick did his usual, <a href="/2012/06/21/site-visit-w-nick-knacks-creative-interiors-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very meticulous prep-work</a> in order to ensure that none of Katherine&#8217;s belongings were damaged.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6016 mb-24 size-full" title="06_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/06_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/06_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/06_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> We love how clean and minimal the design is &#8211;and while we can only see a glimpse of the desk from around the corner, we can still get a sense of its conceptual lightness.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6017 mb-24 size-full" title="07_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Here&#8217;s the designer, Katherine Hammond. Once her desk was in place, Katherine painted a few layers of <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magnetic paint primer</a> onto the wall above. Now her inspirations can also float (without damaging the wall!). Covering the magnetic layer is Benjamin Moore&#8217;s <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/for-painting-contractors/paint-products/satin-impervo-alkyd-low-lustre-paint#advs=0&amp;tab=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Satin Impervo</a>, which was also used on the desk.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6029 mb-24 size-full" title="09_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/09_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/09_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/09_theSweeten_floatingdesk1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The desktop and drawer faces were built with MDF then painted, while the drawer interiors feature the natural grain and texture of finished plywood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6030 mb-24 size-full" title="10_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />We couldn&#8217;t be happier to have found the perfect match for Katherine&#8217;s project! Many thanks to Nick, Dawn &amp; team at Nick Knacks Creative Interiors, and to Katherine of Katherine Hammond Interiors.</p>
