<h3>From Renting to Buying</h3>
<p>I’ve always had a passion for real estate. I even work in real estate tech as a product manager. Since moving to the city over 10 years ago, I’ve spent my fair share of time looking at listings of apartments for sale. After many years in tiny Manhattan studios (think 300 square feet), it was time to get serious about buying an apartment.</p>

<p>I started to hunt for Manhattan apartments (with a preference for downtown) that were both affordable and true one-bedrooms. I spent around nine months going to open houses on Sundays, and after seeing many apartments, I finally stumbled upon the space I ended up buying in Chelsea.</p>
<p>It might have been how quiet and calm the apartment felt, but it was exactly what I was looking for. It is a true one-bedroom in a prewar building and has much of its original charm: a sunken living room and beautiful arches. But the original kitchen was the size of a closet. I used the fact that it was outdated as negotiating leverage and was able to bring the purchase price significantly below asking (a rarity in Manhattan).</p>

<blockquote><p>Everyone I talked to told me that the most I’d fit into the space was a 24” stove, but my heart was set on fitting a large turkey into my oven.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Deciding Who to Hire</h3>
<p>After asking around, I realized that finding a general contractor to do work in a Manhattan co-op was no easy task. I stumbled upon Sweeten, and after <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27395" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting my job</a> there, I connected with a few general contractors. I didn’t go the architect route because it would have added to my budget on top of the renovation materials. Also, I wasn&#8217;t <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planning any significant structural change</a>s. For a one-bedroom renovation, that extra cost is just enough to push the cost over the return. Without an architect, however, finding a detail-oriented general contractor who is on top of their game was paramount. That’s exactly what I found with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3275#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Sweeten contractor I chose</a>.</p>

<h3>Must-Have: An Oven to Fit a Turkey</h3>
<p>The biggest part of the remodel was gutting my tiny kitchen. I hired a kitchen designer to help me optimize the layout. She came up with configurations I couldn’t imagine possible in a 70-square-foot space. As an avid cook, I had a few (okay, maybe slightly crazy) requirements: a full size 30” stove, a large refrigerator, and a dishwasher. I was told the most I’d fit into the space was a 24” stove, but my heart was set on fitting a large turkey into my oven. And after much finagling, we found a layout that allowed for everything I wanted and more (somehow, I even fit a wine fridge).</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Kayla-Taylor-KitchenBath-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41412 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Kayla-Taylor-KitchenBath-08.jpg" alt="Image of sunken living room with railing and cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Kayla-Taylor-KitchenBath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Kayla-Taylor-KitchenBath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Kayla-Taylor-KitchenBath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>The original plan was to buy custom cabinets to maximize the tiny space, but after seeing the price tag (north of $15,000), I had to reconsider. My Sweeten contractor worked closely with me to come up with a solution: a combination of <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/kitchen-cabinets/buying-guide/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom and standard cabinets</a>. We spent two hours talking through cabinet door sizes as well as placement so that the doors were symmetrical and made sense for the space. (Trust me, this guy pays a lot of attention to detail.) For my peninsula, he took the lead on creating both a practical layout and aesthetically pleasing geometric shape. There needed to be enough room to pass when walking into the apartment (the front door is right near the kitchen).</p>

<h3>A Refresh for the Apartment</h3>
<p>Beyond the kitchen, the remainder of the renovation was giving the apartment a facelift. I refinished the floors, stripped the door frames down to their original steel, replaced the baseboards, changed the grout in the bathroom, added a closet in the bedroom, and put a nice layer of paint on all of the walls.</p>
<h3>Delivery Saga</h3>
<p>While much of the kitchen renovation was a fun process, I’d be lying if I said there weren’t bumps along the way. Most of my friends do not believe me when I tell them I bought six sinks for the kitchen. Yep, you read that right: six sinks. To make a long story short: there was a farmhouse sink that was too shallow (thankfully, my contractor pointed this out to me), one that fell off a truck during delivery, another that arrived and didn&#8217;t fit, another that arrived then got lost (and eventually found again), and two others that ended up getting returned. When the sink saga was over, my boyfriend told me he never wanted to talk about another sink again. And honestly, who could blame him?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I ended up with a beautifully renovated home that stayed true to its prewar nature. A common question I was asked after completing my renovation was: Would I do it all over again? You betcha.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Kayla and Jesse, for sharing your refreshed home!</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nearly 25 years ago, the homeowners were on the hunt for a three-bedroom rental with more space for their two children—who’d long been sharing a bedroom. They stumbled upon a Chelsea apartment, converted from a factory space, that was actually for sale. They agreed to go through with buying their first place—where they’ve lived ever since. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the couple had their kitchen renovated, but left every other room intact—until they decided to remodel the guest bathroom. “It was embarrassingly retro. The faucets didn’t work, there was a gap behind the sink. It just looked old,” they shared. Another priority? To convert the bathtub into a walk-in shower. “My dad, who is in his 90s, stays with us a lot, too,” one of the homeowners shared, so that update was especially important to give him easier access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/admin/projects/32293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project to Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4845#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who would provide design and build help to modernize the space. Guidance picking out and sourcing materials was the main factor in their decision. “Other contractors facilitate the project, file the permits, demolish, install, etc—but then I would’ve had to go find the sink, the toilet, the faucet. This contractor offered to help us find all of our materials, it was part of their service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img decoding="async" title="beige-bathroom-wall-tiles"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48774 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Beige bathroom wall tiles with white pedestal sink along with white bathtub and toilet before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><strong>After</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Before work could begin, the building’s co-op board engineer presented a list of possible requirements, from waterproofing to disability access.  The contractor had to apply for a lot of permits, and at one point in the process, the Sweeten Client Services team stepped in to facilitate an issue and get communication between the homeowner and contractor back on the right track.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubNuCmtu1M8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the approval and permits were all set, the couple and their Sweeten contractor got to work on finding materials that aligned with their vision of a clean, classic black-and-white bathroom. They all went to a showroom together to see what caught the renovators’ eyes, including a dotted marble floor tile. The homeowners love natural stone material, so they opted for a Calacatta porcelain tile for the shower walls. The vanity is a custom piece that ties in the bi-tonal color palette and offers plenty of storage. An offset sink (we’re seeing more and more of these) lends one side of the counter for more storage, too.</span></p>

The contractor&#8217;s designer was the perfect partner for us,” they shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contracting team was diligent about cleaning up the dust every single day since the homeowners were living at home during the renovation. The guest bathroom is near the entryway and was cordoned off for construction. “They all took the job seriously, completed the job with meticulous work, and got it done pretty quickly. We saw real care,” the homeowners said. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Sara-Moulton-Bathroom-09.jpg"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-black-metal-pulls"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48772 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-14.jpg" alt="White bathroom with black metal pulls on storage space after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-pocelain-shower-tiles-hand-shower"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48768 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="White porcelain shower tiles with white matte wall tiles and hand shower after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />The renovators really appreciated having Sweeten to count on throughout the process. “I am sure Sweeten helps people of all kinds,  but we were newbies and needed more direction than most folks,” they shared.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the timeline shifted a bit given the board approval challenges, once the process got rolling, it was finished in six weeks (and just in time for a birthday party the couple was hosting.) </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The renovators were so amazed by the hard work of each subcontractor that handled the demolition, electrical, lighting, and tiling. “I was struck by the uniformly high quality no matter which team it was,” one homeowner shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Bianco Carrara black dot marble mosaic floor tile; floor stone border in black polished marble; FAP Lumin white matte wall tile 10”x 30”; Fondovalle Calacatta porcelain shower tiles: </span><a href="https://www.tilesbykia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiles by Kia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;ve been following this high-style, high-design project in Chelsea for the last year. The owner of this 900 square foot apartment in the iconic London Terrace building is a friend of Sweeten&#8217;s founder and CEO, Jean. We watched as the homeowner and contractor worked together to bring new life to a space with gorgeous historical roots and we were so psyched about the work happening here, we did what any friend would do: take the referral of a great contractor! These photos would probably be convincing enough, but as we do with every expert in our network, we checked references and interviewed the contractor to get a feel for his talents, expertise, experience, and professionalism. After finishing the project and going through the Sweeten screening process, we&#8217;re delighted to introduce <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/226">Sweeten Expert Gregorio</a> as a new member of our network of professionals. I&#8217;ll have more to share with you this spring about how our screening process works, but first, you have to see these swoon-worthy photos!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11303 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-021.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="397" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-021.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-021-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11304 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-031.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="397" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-031.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-031-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11305 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-041.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-041.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-041-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jean&#8217;s friend, an architect, had lived in the building for almost a decade before this unit hit the market. Prior to moving in, the new homeowner set out to address two main issues: the apartment had a series of cramped rooms dotted with small closets, and the entryway was unnecessarily divided in two segments. Both of these elements were disruptive to the flow, feel, and function of the space<span id="more-11282"></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The results of addressing these two goals alone were dramatic: by combining and moving a closet from the entry hall into the bedroom for a larger walk-in, and annexing another storage area into the bathroom for a true linen closet, the owner opened up the flow of the rooms and created far more functional storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11318 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-01.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-01-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Storage aside, the owner took a meticulous approach to recreating the visual presence of the building&#8217;s heritage. Sweeten Expert Gregorio added accentuated molding details throughout each room to exaggerate the space and add a grander feel. The homeowner was able to keep the original wood floors but transformed them with a matte black finish. The resulting contrast with the white and gray color palette makes the space feel bright but also infuses each room with some grit. It looks natural and effortless now, but it took the homeowner more than six tries, and eight coats, to get the stain effect he had in mind!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11306 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-051.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-051.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-051-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11307 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-061.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-061.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-061-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11308 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-071.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-071.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-071-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gregorio&#8217;s team removed the kitchen island, expanded the flooring into the kitchen to unify the living space, installed white lacquer cabinets, white calacatta countertops, and put in a 24&#8243; Bertazzoni range.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11312 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-111.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-111.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-111-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The homeowner designed the custom built-in millwork in the living room with a high-gloss lacquer section combined with a walnut storage unit to create a light, bright feel complemented by the warmth of the natural wood. The millwork hovers cleanly over the floor, doubling as a showcase for favorite items and as a hideaway for the tv. To continue the play on materials, the radiators were stripped to expose original metals. The new radiators are an unlikely star of the show: visitors to the apartment typically comment first on the apartment&#8217;s views and then on the metallic radiators. A circular lighting fixture from Ochre anchors the living room between original ceiling beams.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Gregorio worked through a full upgrade of the windowed bathroom, removing the tub to replace it with a walk-in glass shower, ripping out old tile and bringing in black travertine slabs, and swapping out old fixtures with modern sink and toilet selections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedroom, the homeowner designed a second custom built-in that beautifully offsets the neutral palette. Throughout the apartment, in a nod to his architecture and fashion background, the homeowner chose Benjamin Moore&#8217;s Coventry Gray (HC 169), a color favored in Dior stores around the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11313 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-121.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-121.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-121-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So many thanks to Jean&#8217;s friend and Sweeten Expert Gregorio for a peek into this brilliantly designed and expertly built home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/00_COVER-2.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10524" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/00_COVER-2.png" alt="00_COVER-2" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/00_COVER-2.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/00_COVER-2-585x390.png 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/00_COVER-2-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Here at Sweeten, we understand that pairing the correct architect and client is more than circumstantial, and that the best working relationships are based largely on shared visions and philosophies. This <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/portfolios/448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chelsea gut renovation</a> project brought together Sweeten member firm Future Project, co-owned by Pedro Pachano and Ampara Vollert, who specialize in exploring theories of space and sensory discovery in their architecture, with an art collector client who wanted more than just a space to showcase her individual art pieces. The art-loving homeowner was looking for something that would act as a flexible framework for her entire collection and lifestyle.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The apartment&#8217;s original layout was made up of a number of smaller rooms that varied in floor height, which did not allow for two key aspects that the homeowner specified for her remodeled home: to be able to entertain large numbers of people, and to have significant wall space for her collected works.<span id="more-10514"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10516" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg" alt="01_living" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">By removing a series of interior walls, integrating a diffused lighting system that creates flattering light for the homeowner&#8217;s many dinner parties, and using wide plank, white washed maple flooring and continuous, white walls and surface planes, the renovated apartment can now be experienced as an expansive space that is punctuated with art and views of the city.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10517" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg" alt="02_kitchen-entrance" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, Pedro and Ampara created a similarly expansive yet more personalized experience by using materials that engage both the senses of vision and touch. Here, custom, white Corian cabinets create uniform planes which are even used to hide the appliances, and a nice plus is that the Corian panels are pleasant to the touch. Knowing the homeowner&#8217;s propensity to entertain, the Future Project team designed a custom cantilevered island. The island is topped with an ocean blue resin surface like the countertop and backsplash which creates visual depth in the space and “relaxes the eye.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10518" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg" alt="03_family" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10519" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg" alt="04_family-2" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Discovery&#8221; was a theme Future Project worked with in their design, and we love how they used this idea here in the den area with this unique paneled wall system. The polished Rosewood veneer panels open to reveal a series of interior spaces, each with its own color of polished lacquer paint and unique function. One door leads to a guest bathroom, another to a roll-out closet system, and the one above opens to a colorful custom bar installation by a contemporary artist.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10536" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg" alt="bath" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;s a peek into the guest bath, one of our favorite rooms in the apartment. This space features a custom vanity and shower construction made of grey Corian with mirrored edges which make for a unique, fragmented optical illusion.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10520" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg" alt="05_master-bath" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The master bathroom is equally blue and oceanic. The walls, floor and ceiling here are tiled in 1&#8243; <a href="https://www.glasstile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oceanside Tessera glass mosaic tiles</a>, and the vanity is custom in white Thassos marble.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10521" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg" alt="06_bedroom" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Because she entertains so frequently, the homeowner wanted the option of a guest room, but at the same time did not want to give up her home&#8217;s open, gallery-like quality. Pedro and Ampara came up with a smart solution to accommodate both needs with a custom sliding wall (for separation) and second bed that&#8217;s all stored beneath the master bed.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10522" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png" alt="08_double-wine-hallway" width="600" height="428" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">As if we needed any further proof, this homeowner&#8217;s wine closet is yet another testament to her hostessing skills &#8212; so, when&#8217;s the next party?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Great work and many thanks to Future Project&#8217;s Pedro and Ampara for sharing their work with us; we look forward to seeing more from these designers, soon!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a busy week at Forever Construction &amp; Design, Inc. They just wrapped up two projects, one, a studio renovation in Midtown and the other an office in Chelsea . We met with Harry Grahm owner of Forever Construction &amp; Design to get the scoop.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/New-office-Chelsea-New-York-NY-awarded-to-contractor/364#details"> first project </a>was one that Forever Construction &amp; Design was connected to via theSweeten. The company, <a href="https://www.fanbridge.com/">Fanbridge,</a> needed a very quick office renovation to minimize the interruption to their growing team. They needed to remove some walls and add glass inserts to others, change some of the lighting, refinish the floors and then a fresh coat of paint on everything.</p>
<div>
<dl id="attachment_3007">

<dd><span class="img-label"> FanBridge was busy moving in when we were there. Harry&#8217;s work was done and they couldn&#8217;t have been happier.</span></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Noah Dinkin the Co-Founder of FanBridge said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Harry and his crew came through for us 100%.  Everything was handled not only professionally, but on time and in budget.  Since we&#8217;ve moved in, Harry has remained available for any small fixes we hadn&#8217;t anticipated.  All in all, both theSweeten and Forever Design were totally positive experiences and highly recommended.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Awesome Thanks Noah!</p>
<p>For the studio Harry &amp; his team worked closely with the clients&#8217; concerns and budget to give this studio apartment a thorough upgrade which included an all-new kitchen, bathroom updates, new storage solutions, lighting &amp; hardware, fresh paint &amp; refinished hardwoods. To keep within budget the homeowners went with a great alternative to skim coating and  pre-fab cabinetry rather than custom.</p>
