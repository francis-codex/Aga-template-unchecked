</ul>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Opening up a claustrophobic layout</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Be patient and be bold,” Can Vu Bui, a Brooklyn principal at <a href="https://oo-t.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of Things</a>, a collaborative architecture and design studio, likes to tell his clients. This was his mantra going into the main floor gut renovation of an Art Deco–era rowhouse in Glendale, Queens. Bui’s slow, steady approach led to a striking result.</span></p>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<h5></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The homeowners had been living in the home when they hired Bui, and were ready for dramatic change on the brick building’s first floor. They planned on revising the existing layout to bring air and light to a chronically dreary space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After coming up with a concept reflecting light modernism,</span><span class="s1"> Bui created a project plan and posted the job on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our website</a>. They worked with the homeowner to review bids and portfolios before hiring a contracting firm in Queens.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Starting out, the team had their work cut out for them. “The house’s primary problem was a direct product of its 1920s design,” the architect said. The brick-and-mortar building, surrounded by townhomes, had a narrow, chopped-up floor plan.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The challenges of opening the 600-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main floor space</a>, according to Bui, were abundant. A load-bearing masonry wall blocked light from reaching the living and dining rooms. Walls that separated the stair, kitchen, and dining area inhibited flow, creating “small, claustrophobic” spaces, he said.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">“We designed custom millwork that provided a pantry, cabinets, and a low bench.”</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51433 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03.jpg" alt="Image of the family room with black couch and arched entry to dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-51441 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-11.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated dining room with view of stairway and built in storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Art Deco-approved arches</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The light and space problems at the top of Bui’s task list were only the beginning. “This project presented an opportunity to fix those pragmatic issues,” he said, but also to pull together and “artfully unify” the divided ground floor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Door frames and wall openings were inconsistent, but the building held some inspiring original details. Fortunately, a few with gently rounded upper corners caught the architect’s eye.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bui envisioned sloping designs to link the spaces together. “We replaced existing walls with elegant structural arches,” the architect said. “The rooms open generously into each other, allowing light to pour into the home’s interior.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Stairs open up with storage</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite the desire for openness and light, maximum storage space was still needed for functionality and day-to-day life, particularly in New York City homes, according to Bui. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to his plan, the general contractor opened the wall between the existing stair and dining room, removing a large, square center section. Next, the contracting team revised the staircase, adding a landing a few steps from the base and then introducing a turn, so that the last few steps led into the dining room. The changes helped the narrow stairs and small dining room feel instantly less claustrophobic.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51448 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-18.jpg" alt="Image of an open stairway with custom storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-18-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-18-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51449 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19.jpg" alt="Image of built-in storage with drawers and cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the breaking through of the wall eliminated key storage space. Bui found a fix. “We designed <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom millwork</a>” surrounding the new wall opening, he says, “that provided a pantry, cabinets, and a low bench,” as well as custom handrails. In the end, a partially exposed stairway brings light and drama to the home.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Paint colors and bright finishes</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walls and the interior planes of the arches are painted in muted shades—green, ochre, and blue. Curved millwork is also seen on a full wall of open storage in the dining room. The brushed oak is stained with a hint of gold. Brass accents bring warmth to the rooms.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51442 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-12.jpg" alt="Image of a newly renovated kitchen with checkerboard floor and green walls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-51444 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-14.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated galley kitchen with black and white floor" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/43173-MatthewS-Townhouse-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Many homeowners and designers fear color,” he said. “It makes sense—you don’t want to be stuck with the wrong one.” The architectural team worked closely with the homeowner throughout the process, providing renderings, tests, and mockups to prevent surprises. For instance, the shade of gold on the walls in the foyer and dining room carefully bookends the space without overwhelming or darkening the area.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The pale <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">green in the kitchen</a> and reading nook plays homage to classical French country homes,” Bui said. The effect is an inviting color path leading one through the house. “Our goal,” Bui said, “is to let color boldly elevate the feeling of a space.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Architect + Sweeten general contractor = Teamwork heaven</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout the process, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architect and Sweeten general contractor</a> worked together closely, executing Bui’s vision. “As architects, we spend a lot of time designing custom details—our relationships with the contractors who can make them are critical. It’s great to work with craftspeople who bring insight and <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/queens-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expertise to the project</a>.”</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the end, Bui explained, the renovation made over the once spiritless space—it feels bright and modern, but not harsh or humorless. Furthermore, color and flow now have a direct impact on the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comfort one feels in their surroundings</a>. “This is a home, after all,” Bui said. “It should feel special.”</span></p>

Guest post by Sweeten homeowners Heather and Eric in Manhattan</p>
<p><em>Even though Heather and Eric knew nothing about renovating, they took the chance of starting a remodeling project before moving into their new apartment. Their interpretation of &#8220;home, sweet home&#8221; meant a non-cookie-cutter space with natural light, a welcoming kitchen, architectural details, and wide-plank flooring. With the help of the team they connected with through Sweeten, the free service that matches homeowners with vetted general contractors, the renovating couple&#8217;s &#8220;get-it-done&#8221; attitude included ferrying materials through the city with up-to-the-minute decisions to meet a five-week timeline.  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we were looking for a new place, we ignored all gut-renovation apartments off-the-cuff, but when we saw this 850-square foot co-op, we knew it had great potential. It was dark, barren, and dated, and probably hadn’t been touched since it was built in 1972, but it had natural lighting from the east, south, and northern exposures, high-rise views, and a prime location. Neither Heather nor I had previous renovation experience, but through conversations with friends and family, and research on Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we felt prepared to post our Gramercy apartment remodel project</a> and move forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Heather, not knowing an engagement proposal was forthcoming, eagerly pushed for the exciting summer project. So only three days before I popped the question, we put in an offer on the property. After she said, &#8220;Yes!&#8221; the project truly began.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our goal was to take this dark space that had no overhead lighting, &#8217;70s popcorn ceilings, and a cramped galley kitchen and modernize it, opening it up to highlight the apartment’s natural light and spaciousness. We wanted it to feel unique and stand out from the crowd of standard New York starter homes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We prepared a timeline to begin the day after closing with the goal to finish the job in five weeks in order to beat our old apartment’s lease expiration. However, after the seller delayed the closing, we had to improvise living remotely for three weeks and then through the final two weeks of construction. With this delay, we, along with our contractor, had to personally roll our new kitchen cabinets across two New York City avenues! On top of that, our building only allowed renovation work between 9 am to 4 pm on weekdays. Did I mention we had no prior renovating experience?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With a timeline like this, Sweeten was critical in hiring our contractor—before which, we had interviewed three contractors who could not meet our timeline or budget. Sweeten immediately matched us with two contractors who both had great reviews and offered competitive quotes. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The one we chose was eager</a> to meet our timeline, always arriving early and ending late. He visited us on weekends and did additional research and buying outside of the labor and roughing. Our contractor provided ideas when asked and would respond with a “No problem” to any request—a luxury during a difficult and stressful project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We created a defined foyer by reframing walls and building a Moroccan archway, which led into the kitchen. Other hallway closets were also reframed to provide symmetry throughout the apartment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We envisioned an open kitchen with a bar counter that provided a natural gathering spot for breakfast and entertaining. To get there, we completely gutted the kitchen, replacing all of the old cabinets and appliances, and took advantage of every inch of space. We moved the refrigerator to the opposite side of the kitchen and raised the microwave by six inches, allowing us to cut through the wall of the previous galley kitchen and create an opening with recessed, under-cabinet puck lighting. We accented the space with quartz countertops, glass cabinetry, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/at-home-with-herringbone-patterns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">herringbone</a> marble backsplash, and stainless steel hardware.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32379 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-bedroom-recessed-light" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen11-723x482.jpg" alt="blue bedroom with recessed light in white ceiling and dark wooden flooring after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tackling the lack of overhead lighting, we chose nonstructural beams in the living room and bedroom with LEDs inserted. The beams gave the space a unique structural aesthetic and provided a clever lighting solution. We then added <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crown molding</a> in the entire apartment for more dimension. The flooring throughout had been a traditional parquet not revisited since the original construction of the building in the ‘70s. We replaced it with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wide-plank-flooring-smart-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wide-plank</a> espresso hardwood flooring to balance the white and off-white cabinetry and furnishings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, at post-renovation, we realize how important it is to plan ahead. It’s better to have all your ideas on paper before you begin, from important aspects like flooring and appliances to the small details that are easy to overlook, such as cabinet hardware, paint colors, lighting fixtures, and electrical outlets. Having this mapped out will make your life and your contractor’s life much easier during the renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Truthfully, we look back and are still unsure how we were able to sketch, design, renovate, and implement all of our aesthetic and structural changes without any background or experience in any of these areas. Day by day, the apartment came together and by the end, we were incredibly proud of what we accomplished. Now we have a few months to relax before the wedding.</p>
