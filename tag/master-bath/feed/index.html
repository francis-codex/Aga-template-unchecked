<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, we’re taking a look at the rebirth of a trinity townhouse in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Center City Philadelphia. The house, built in the style of a trinity, a slim structure that became popular during a population boom in the early 18th century, caught Nel&#8217;s eye while she was looking to purchase her first home. Two years later, the house was severely damaged by a fire that ravaged the entire street, resulting in a total gut.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 1,200-square-foot home has three stories—plus a basement and roof deck with amazing city views—and had to be rebuilt from the studs up. Nel decided to keep the original floor plans intact—the first-floor dining room and kitchen, second-floor living room plus full bath, and third-floor master bedroom and bath—and bring them back to life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/18505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her renovation plans in mind</a>, she came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free platform connecting homeowners to vetted general contractors, to restore the house to its former glory and find a new tenant who would love it just as much as she did.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01.webp" alt="Trinity house in Philadelphia" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57264" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/908_082-1000px.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><b><br />
Sweeten: </b>What motivated you to purchase this trinity house and what led to the renovation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>In 2014 I was looking to purchase my first home, and when I saw this house I absolutely fell in love with it. The house is a 100-year-old trinity located in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Center City Philadelphia. I&#8217;m not sure if you have seen many trinities, but they are a pretty common home type in Philadelphia where the house is three stories tall and each floor is typically a single room. I met Greg shortly thereafter and the two of us lived in the house up until we got engaged in April 2016. We decided to move out because we were thinking about starting a family and wanted to find a home with a second bedroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was a bit attached to this house and since I work in real estate we decided to try our hand at renting it versus selling it. We found great tenants and everything was going well until the fire last October. The fire destroyed six houses—so basically, the entire block! It was heart-wrenching to watch something I had so many happy memories in be destroyed by fire. But, very fortunately, we have been able to rebuild, which actually has been a funny process because we were able to make some of the upgrades and changes we previously wanted to do when we lived there.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sample-Trinity-House-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27906 mb-10 size-chrono" title="trinity house floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sample-Trinity-House-Floorplan-723x896.jpg" alt="trinity house floor plan" width="723" height="896" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Example of a trinity floor plan that&#8217;s similar in size and layout to Nel&#8217;s house</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What made you choose the neighborhood back when you were looking to purchase a home?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>The Bella Vista neighborhood is truly one of my favorites in Philadelphia. We have a 100-year-old Italian bakery at the end of our street and so there is always the wonderful smell of something delicious baking in the air. We are also just around the corner from a park with a bocce court, as well as from the 9th Street Italian Market. I love the neighborhood&#8217;s vibe and all of the small independent businesses and restaurants that are at our front door.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What’s your favorite part of the house?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>I think one of my favorite parts, aside from the 360-degree views from the roof deck, is the exposed brick wall. It feels like a piece of history which is really neat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What it was like working with your general contractor?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>This is actually our second renovation in 12 months, but our first time using Sweeten. I can&#8217;t tell you how wonderful our Sweeten contractor has been. He took a very stressful situation and guided us through it with ease, and we couldn&#8217;t have been happier with how everything has turned out. Greg and I have actually joked about moving back in!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>Now that the house is finished, what are your plans for it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>We are going to keep it as a rental for now and who knows&#8230;maybe someday we will live there again!</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Now let’s check in with the Sweeten general contractor responsible for this townhouse’s transformation.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> What were the challenges you faced while renovating this trinity house?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor:</b> It was the amount of work that needed to take place in the small footprint of the house. We needed to add new code-compliant systems to a home that was designed to have a small footprint over 100 years ago! Several homes on the same block that were also damaged in the fire were under construction at the same time, so parking was limited. Material deliveries on the small street were very tough, if not impossible. All of the materials for the roof deck and drywall needed to be loaded in by hand. Also, work on the roof deck was held up due to permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What was the damage done by the fire?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>The entire home was flooded by the water used to extinguish the rooftop fire. The house was dried out and all damaged organic materials were removed prior to us being hired by a restoration company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> What major work did you and your team tackle during the renovation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>We installed all new electric, some plumbing, a new high-efficiency HVAC, insulation, drywall, and new finishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> Did you encounter any delays during the process?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>Yes, the roof deck had to be designed by a licensed architect—we couldn&#8217;t replace what was there under the permit for the interior. The drawings for the roof deck also needed to be completed and reviewed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> The results are simply stunning—all of your hard work has definitely paid off!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>Overall, it was a great project, Nel was a wonderful client and we couldn&#8217;t have done it without Sweeten making the match. We are very proud of the work we did here and how the home turned out.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Nel and her Sweeten general contractor for sharing their story, both the good and the bad, and giving us a look inside this reborn trinity!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Thinking of designing a black and white bathroom? Here&#8217;s proof they’re not all same.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to bathroom design, there’s no combination more iconic than black and white. The traditional pairing can be executed in many ways, from tile to fixtures, in a range of textures and patterns. While a black and white bathroom is a common choice, renovators can take many approaches to reflect their personal tastes. See how these homeowners, who worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, got the black and white bathroom of their dreams.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">1. Tile and Grout</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33913 size-full" title="white-bathroom-subway-tiles-deep-tub" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-05.jpg" alt="white bathroom with subway tiles and deep tub and shower curtains after renovation" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-pallavi-keyurs-murray-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pallavi and Keyur</a> had a black and white palette in mind when they envisioned their renovation. The final execution is on point, thanks to a thoughtful mix of tile and grout colors. The shower-bath wall features long white tiles offset with a darker grout. On the other hand, the bath siding provides a welcome inverse effect. The siding features smaller black ceramic with white grout. The natural-wood vanity brings warmth and contrast to the black and white bathroom.</p>
<h3>2. Statement floor tile in a black and white bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25234 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="black and white bathroom, renovation, home, design, construction" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>A last-minute addition proved a good decision in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/75-year-old-hall-bathroom-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary Ann and Frank’s renovation</a>. Their hallway guest bath took a traditional route with the old-fashioned sink, glass walk-in shower, and subway-tile bath. It was the fun graphic floor tile that brought an unexpected contemporary touch.</p>
<h3>3. Classic Color Blocking</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/9735-Lindsay-Apt-02.webp" alt="This bathroom uses black and white tile to create a classic, yet modern bathroom design" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-57238 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/9735-Lindsay-Apt-02.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/9735-Lindsay-Apt-02-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/9735-Lindsay-Apt-02-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you didn’t know it was renovated, you’d think <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/art-deco-apartment-washing-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay and Nicholas’ bathroom</a> is all original. The quintessential black and white bathroom features full-tiled white walls with slim black chair-rail accent tiles. The flooring is visually anchored with matte black hexagonal tile.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">4. Pops of Black</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24012 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="This mostly white bathroom uses black accents to create a clean, bright and modern design" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-10-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A leak made <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/bathroom-remodel-uber-chic-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katie and Lance’s</a> bathroom remodel an urgent matter. As a result, their focus leaned toward function over aesthetics. They pared down their original vision of intricate floor tiles and a teak vanity. However, the final result looked like anything but an afterthought. The couple chose to create a mostly-white bathroom with small pops of black from hardware and accessories. The result feels completely effortless and relaxing.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">5. Fun Florals</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27199 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="This bathroom also features a pop of light pink to create a unique design" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/head-turner-bathroom-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nancy and Aram</a> were required to stick with the existing footprint of their bathroom. As a result, they opted to change all their fixtures and room details. For the tile, they mingled textures. The couple chose a circular dark gray-and-white tile for the shower, a floral-like motif for the floor, and a standard white subway wall tile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Elevating privacy with an extra WC</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If your home only has one bathroom, then you’ve probably fantasized about moving to a bigger place just to get a second one. Maybe you don’t have to move to accomplish your goal! These five Sweeten homeowners repurposed existing square footage in their homes—adjusting layouts and converting closets, alcoves, and unused rooms—in order to add another bathroom. Whether it&#8217;s a powder room, master or guest bath, home just got a little more comfortable.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To make it easier to accommodate guests in their home in Riverhead, NY, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/bathroom-renovation-country-home-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nate and Michelle</a> added an ensuite bath to their second bedroom. “Our main question was really just how difficult would it be to add a bathroom where one hadn’t existed before,” said Nate. The couple found the perfect location: an alcove that was located next to the guest bedroom and right above the downstairs bath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27390 mb-0 size-chrono" title="powder room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="adding a bathroom" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it came time to update the rental-grade bathroom in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-gets-a-nordic-look-for-bathrooms-and-closets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Felix’s condo</a>, she decided to add a powder room as well. The 1,500-square-foot apartment had plenty of room for guests and potential for a third bedroom in the future, but only one bathroom. The new addition brings a whole new level of comfort to the home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32953 size-chrono" title="master bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="adding a bathroom" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32954 mb-0 size-chrono" title="master bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="adding a bathroom" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rather than renovating the existing upstairs bath in her Brooklyn brownstone, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meredith</a> started from scratch and ripped out the second-floor kitchen. She transformed the space into a closet and master bathroom with a huge shower. “The new shower is about the size of the studio I lived in during grad school,” said Meredith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_AimeeWalker_Apt01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30627 size-chrono" title="master bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_AimeeWalker_Apt01-723x482.jpg" alt="adding a bathroom" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_AimeeWalker_Apt18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30626 mb-0 size-chrono" title="master bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_AimeeWalker_Apt18-723x482.jpg" alt="adding a bathroom" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with their Sweeten general contractor, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-creative-home-to-call-their-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aimee and B</a> came up with a plan to add a second bathroom to their 3-bed, 1-bath apartment. Reconfiguring the layout mean taking down a wall between two of the bedrooms so that the master bedroom lined up next to a large walk-in closet. That spot became the master bath and a new closet was built for the couple’s clothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-BrettArpel-Apt20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32118 mb-0 size-chrono" title="guest bath" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-BrettArpel-Apt20-723x1085.jpg" alt="adding a bathroom" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/when-pros-design-their-family-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terri and Brett&#8217;s</a> primary objective during their renovation was to add a second bathroom as a guest bath, which they achieved by relocating the bedroom doors and reducing the size of the hallway closets. “Our families come over frequently now and we love that we were able to add a second bathroom. It really helps make ‘our’ space feel more private,” Brett said.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Turning a leaky bathroom into a modern space in Harlem</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The condo Jen and Luke purchased two years ago was in move-in condition. It had everything they needed, including the extras—central air, washer and dryer, dishwasher, ice maker, and garbage disposal. But, as it turned out, it also had a poorly laid-out bathroom that caused them nightmares. They had an interior architect friend who helped with the design, but <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project on Sweeten</a> to find <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="gray-marble-bathroom-with-shower-head" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49106 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Gray marble bathroom with shower head and wall fixtures before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a decade, Jen, a senior managing director of a residential real estate firm in Manhattan, and Luke, who works in IT for a women’s fashion and accessory house, had been subletting an apartment. When the owner decided to sell, they searched close to their neighborhood and found a 948-square-foot apartment in an 1892 factory building that had been converted to condos.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The master bathroom was the one dark spot on their otherwise sunny horizon. Apparently, there was a leak in the shower pan, which was causing the light gray marble floor to turn brown, yellow, and pink. “When we purchased the apartment, we didn’t realize that the shower was previously repaired for a leak,” Luke said. “But the repair hadn’t addressed the cause of the leak, which was the shower pan itself. We took this as a sign to renovate our bathroom.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: They contacted their friend and interior architect Irene Kang. “We could not have done this without her help,” Luke said. Kang suggested a minimalist design “with cool colors that maximized the space and had a lot of storage.” As a real estate professional, Jen used her expertise as well. “Bathrooms are personal,” she said. “Sometimes apartments don’t sell due to bathrooms since they are one of the most expensive rooms to renovate.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They decided to go with neutral colors and plan to hang art to make the space personal. Aside from the shower pan issue, they needed more storage space. Irene suggested <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large cabinets</a> inset into a wall shared with the master bedroom closet. “I knew that there were approximately four to five inches of space on the interior of the drywall,” Luke said. “Knowing this and the depth of the cabinets, I was able to figure out that they would stick out only four to five inches into the bathroom itself, which would not get in the way.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Luke-Miller-Bathroom05.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-black-floor-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49107 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="White bathroom with black floor tiles and floating vanity and vanity mirror and shower niche after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="large-storage-wall-insert-cabinet" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49108 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-05.gif" alt="Large storage cabinets inserted into wall with white pocket door after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first, they weren’t sure where they could find something that would meet their needs. They found themselves at the Kohler Experience Center in Manhattan. “We described our idea, and Caroline [Hughes, their sales rep] suggested looking at the Robern line of cabinets,&#8221; Luke said. &#8220;We did, and that was it.” Now two cabinets measuring 70” tall x 15” wide and 8” deep sit side by side. “They were expensive, but worth it,” he said. In the end, their Sweeten contractor just had to frame it out and cut out a wall stud. “It was simple,” Luke said. To add to the storage, the contractor created a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/shower-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shower niche</a>, while the size of the vanity increased from 36” to 60” wide.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="glass-door-for-shower-niche" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49110 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="Glass door for the shower niche with beige wall tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Between Irene, the Sweeten contractor, and Caroline, “we had lots of help with design decisions,” Luke said. “We made all of our selections, including tiles and fixtures, in one afternoon.&#8221; Jen adds, &#8220;The prices were reasonable and they can help you get non-Kohler items too. They made it super easy.” Their favorite finds are the medicine cabinet above the sink and the LED mirrors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest challenge was living in their apartment <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during the renovation</a>. “We have a one-bedroom, two-bath space and the master bath was undergoing the renovation,” Luke said. “We were subject to mold, mildew, and construction dust, despite the best efforts of the contractor to keep everything clean. He did a superb job of keeping our space livable, but some things you cannot escape unless you have a ventilation system.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="beige-bathroom-wall-tiles-white-grouting" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49111 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="Beige bathroom wall tiles with white grouting and a recessed shower shelf after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their contractor focused on small details too, such as selecting the threshold saddle for the shower and hiding the tile edges with aluminum molding. “He helped with the design and function every step of the way,” said Luke. “Sweeten was in constant contact in case we needed help,&#8221; said Jen. &#8220;Since Luke has project management experience and has worked in furniture factories, we didn’t require the attention that others might. But it was comforting to know they were there when needed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the support is what gave them the bathroom that they envisioned. “You’ve really got to listen to your designers, the store people, and your contractor,” Jen said. “Don’t be afraid to tell people what you want, but if they offer an opinion, listen. The client is always right and they will do what you want, but they know what will look good in years to come.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Big personality comes home with a trough sink and a wine fridge—under the stairs</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27222 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Homeowners Ed and Alicia with their dog, Roxy" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After Roxy, a rescued Rhodesian ridgeback, joined their household, Alicia and Ed realized “a little more space in a laid-back neighborhood” would be a better fit for the family of three than Manhattan, where they were currently living. They set their sights on a 1,400-square-foot garden duplex in a Park Slope brownstone. They fell in love with the building, which had been converted to condos by a developer about a decade ago. Despite the high-end finishes that were chosen at that time, there were issues that had developed in the interim. The couple also wanted to bring the renovations in line with their tastes, and in a style more befitting a building dating from the turn of the last century. As Alicia put it, “We really just wanted to make the place something we loved coming home to at the end of each day. What we had wasn’t awful, but it wasn’t terribly practical either<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>we had mismatched countertops, cracked tiles in the bathroom, a lack of counter space in the master bath, and most importantly, no space in the fridge to store our wine. The place just lacked the ‘wow’ you would expect from a building this pretty.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Before-Watermarked.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27245 size-chrono" title="before: kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Before-Watermarked-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27226 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27224 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached out to Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors—for <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a>. For the couple&#8217;s custom kitchen renovation, Christina, their Sweeten Planner, was present at regular site visits and contractor meetings, providing detailed progress reports. Initially, the couple intended to focus their time and money on the kitchen. Instead, they also updated the guest and master bathrooms executing an overall vision<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>“a muted, classic design with a modern twist.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, this meant replacing the mismatched countertops as well as the cabinet fronts, and creatively finding space for a built-in wine fridge. Ed and Alicia knew that when the kitchen was renovated a decade ago the developer had used top-of-the-line materials, from custom Italian cabinetry to Viking, Miele, and Liebherr appliances; the space didn’t need a gut, simply a refresh. The downside of the custom Italian kitchen, however, was that none of the cabinetry was standard-sized. Refacing was a custom job, pushing out timelines, but it meant they could keep all the existing built-in shelving and customized organization that would have been extremely expensive to replace. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Countertops</a> resembling marble from Caesarstone unified the space and were chosen for their hardiness and durability. Ed had always wanted waterfall-edge countertops, which completed the look perfectly.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27225 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27227 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Chalkboard wall and wine fridge under the stairs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They had hoped to replace a smaller-than-usual refrigerator, as well as add a wine fridge. But the floor plan wouldn’t afford them the space for a larger unit, so they focused on adding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wine fridge</a> instead. Working with their Sweeten contractor, Ed and Alicia poked exploratory holes in the drywall underneath their stairs. Happily, they discovered that a 36-bottle dual zone wine fridge would fit in the space without making any structural changes. “It&#8217;s a luxury you would never think you could have in New York. We painted the surrounding wall with chalkboard paint<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>it’s a great way to leave notes for each other, plan out our grocery list, and try out some amateur artwork,” they said. &#8220;As a bonus, we found the current kitchen fridge is more than large enough for our needs.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The downstairs bathroom was next on the list<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>it already had a great soaking tub, but the vanity and medicine cabinet were outdated. The tiles, too, were showing their age. Alicia had always loved the feel of a traditional New York City bathroom<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>penny tile floors, subway tile, and a classic black-and-white color palette. They replaced the sink with a trough style: “There was debate whether the sink would be too large, but after lots of measuring and imagining how close it would be to someone using the shower or toilet, we decided to do it. We are so glad we did. It is a perfect fit. We also went for the matching faucets and soap dish.” Having forgone <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> under the new sink, they added a small shelf and a 1940s American Red Cross medicine cabinet (found online in Bulgaria!). The large closet just outside of the bathroom made up for the limited storage. Lastly, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-hung-toilets-look-behind-scenes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall-hung toilet</a> was a lot of trouble to install, but ultimately worth the effort, since it’s incredibly easy to keep clean and makes the room feel larger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Living_Room_During-Watermarked-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27469 size-chrono" title="during: dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Living_Room_During-Watermarked-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27228 mb-0 size-chrono" title="exposed brick wall in the dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the renovation of the downstairs bath, the contractor discovered that there was preserved exposed brick along one wall. They hoped that the brick was in the same condition a few feet away in the living room, and asked the contractor to rip down the sheetrock where their dining table would sit. “It turns out we were in luck. The brick looked wonderful, and though we had to unexpectedly reroute some electrical cables and find matching oak to patch up the flooring, it was worth all of the expense and impact on the timeline.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27234 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-14-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27233 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom shower and tub" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-13-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the couple also decided to renovate the master bathroom upstairs. (One of the pluses of living through your renovation is that you can figure out what else needs work while the contractor is on-site!) Since Alicia and Ed moved in while the renovation was still ongoing, they lived with the space for a while and found the bath to be unsuitable in many ways. “The overhead lighting was terrible, and the illuminated mirror died the day after we closed on the apartment. There was the complete lack of shelf space for us to set things down while getting ready, and the leaking pipework rendered the vanity useless for storage. The space really felt unloved.&#8221; To give the room a facelift without breaking the budget, they kept the large soaking tub (same as the one downstairs), the flooring, and toilet. A new white shaker vanity with a marble countertop provided ample storage while an illuminated medicine cabinet and built-in LED lights lit up the room. Adding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass panel</a> in place of the old shower curtain opened the space up. Lastly, a herringbone wallpaper from Ferm Living took the master bath to the next level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They made the home “<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-appliances-worth-hype/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smarter</a>,” by adding outlets in convenient locations for their <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sonos</a> sound system, converting regular to USB outlets where appropriate, adding a video intercom, and installing a full <a href="https://nest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nest</a> thermostat and smoke detector system. Now, they can control the temperature via Amazon Echo (thanks, Alexa!) and ensure that the apartment is a comfortable temperature for Roxy while they are away.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Stairs-During.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27241 mb-0 size-chrono" title="during: Roxy on the stairs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Stairs-During-723x1085.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="During" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although they’d hoped to finish the renovations prior to their move-in date, they ended up <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living through the entire renovation</a>, which lasted four weeks from beginning to end. The toughest part, according to Alicia and Ed, was keeping Roxy out of trouble. (See above.) Their advice to future renovators? “Find a contractor you trust, and take their advice on what things would work well and what to avoid. We used tools like Pinterest, the Sweeten blog, and other online tools to get ideas. Also, if you have space, try to keep some spare materials once you have completed your renovation. We spent a long time trying to find a flooring that matched our current style to patch in around the exposed brick wall. We decided to buy an extra pack this time and store it in our basement in case of emergency. The same thing with all the tile. You never know what could happen in the future<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>for a few hundred dollars, it is worth the investment and peace of mind!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An architect dodged a shady general contractor in the nick of time and ended up with a perfect Sweeten home</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ana and Leo survived the complex process of selling their old apartment and buying a new one simultaneously—no easy feat!—but were nearly taken by an unscrupulous contractor when it came time to renovate. They realized that they needed someone they could trust to facilitate the search for general contractors and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors—</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">turned out to be exactly what they were looking for. (Their words, not ours!) Their Sweeten contractor helped them make layout changes and took on the challenge of creating an oversized sliding door system that allowed the conversion of an open office space into a private guest suite. Here&#8217;s how the couple transformed their Tribeca apartment from an awkward warren of rooms into an open, flexible space that is both comfortable and refined, including redoing the living room, office/guest room, dining space, bedroom, and of course the kitchen and two bathrooms.<br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25429 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22" width="1000" height="706" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-723x510.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-300x212.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Tribeca homeowner and architect Ana</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every real estate agent told us it could not be done. That, in New York, it was nearly impossible to coordinate the sale of our current apartment with the purchase of a new one. But my husband, Leo, was determined, so that is what we set out to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a long search and many disappointments, including lost bid wars and a contract that fell through, fate brought us an amazing real estate broker who made it all possible. <a href="https://www.kristiambrosetti.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristi Ambrosetti</a> was not fazed by the sell-buy challenge and helped us find our new home and sell our old one.</p>
<p>The apartment met all of our requirements—a 1,000-square-foot, 2-bed, 2-bath in a doorman building in Tribeca, with great light and plenty of storage space. The interior, however, was still in its original condition from the &#8217;80s; it needed a complete renovation to update finishes and fix layout issues that made the space feel choppy and awkward—the exact opposite of the contemporary open space we had hoped for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being an architect, I developed the initial plans for the renovation and met with several general contractors that claimed to be available for the job. After <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comparing multiple bids</a>, we were close to signing with one of them but decided to do some background checking first. I was shocked to find that the address listed in their documents was actually an empty storefront in Queens. The thought that we were very close to making a substantial down payment with someone that might not show up for the job really scared us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At that point, we took the search for general contractors online and came across Sweeten. We read about their screening process to find qualified professionals, and it sounded exactly like what we were looking for, so we decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg5YkmLFz4a5xkDfbtxLMvC7WWzQ">post our project</a>. From the beginning, the experience was surprisingly straightforward. Posting on the website was easy and we were soon matched with a few professionals. When we started interviewing potential general contractors, we were contacted by Miranda from Sweeten and she helped us through the whole process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the weeks we had spent interviewing general contractors, we also focused on finalizing the layout and decisions on finishes and fixtures. By the time we signed with our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDUErsavPF6GS1QXwyFWAiekS7sA">chosen Sweeten contractor</a>, we were ready to begin demolition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leo and I had been a little apprehensive about some of our design choices, especially when it came to the changes in the layout, which were intended to make the space more open and flexible. But when demolition began, it became clear that we were on the right track.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening up the kitchen</a>, the contractor also eliminated a narrow wall that partially blocked the entryway and made for a very awkward hallway. Squaring off the angled wall between the living room and the master bedroom made both spaces a lot more pleasant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The change that made the most impact, though, was opening the office (which would double as a guest suite) into the living room. Oversized <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding panels</a> would allow the room to be closed off and provide privacy for overnight guests. However, most of the professionals we spoke to thought the panels would be too heavy and could not be done. The Sweeten contracting team accepted the challenge and executed them beautifully.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The one setback we had during demolition was an unexpected electrical conduit found in one of the living room walls we had planned to demolish. The conduit ran down to the apartment below ours and, therefore, could not be moved. After conversations with the contractor, Leo and I decided to take down the rest of the wall as originally planned and leave only the section that had the conduit, creating a corner niche that was perfect for a bookshelf. Once the renovation was complete, this turned out to be one of our favorite features in the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One aspect that had drawn us to the apartment was a nook next to the living room that seemed perfect for a small bar. Early in the project, we pulled inspiration photos online and it seemed like designing the bar would be fairly easy. That was until we decided the bar should also house a concealed 40-inch TV, which then led to weeks of research and multiple drawing iterations until we landed on a design that met all of our functional requirements for both the bar and the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dining room pendants were another big challenge. The position of the existing light did not align with the center of the dining table, and we were not able to move the light because of the concrete ceiling. I had almost given up on having pendants over the table when Leo came across the Swell String fixture, which allowed for the pendants to be installed in any position, independent of the canopy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The finishes for the bathrooms and kitchen were also much debated. We knew from the beginning we wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble tile</a> in the bathrooms but looked at a wide range of patterns, sizes, and prices. Narrowing down the search to neutral tones and classic patterns, I eventually chose an Asian statuary from TileBar for the master bathroom and a Bardiglio herringbone mosaic for the guest bathroom floor, with the same Asian statuary in the shower. As a contrast to the traditional tile, I selected modern Duravit fixtures and Grohe faucets. The towel warmers had been at the top of our wishlist and after much research, we were able to find a small hardwired option that worked well in both bathrooms.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For our small <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">galley kitchen</a>, we chose the same low-maintenance quartz countertops we had in our previous apartment, paired with white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinets</a> and integrated Bosch appliances. The cabinets were finished with black linear pulls with accent walnut shelves added on the back wall for some extra storage. The backsplash was probably one of the toughest decisions—with so many interesting materials and patterns to choose from, we considered all sorts of options, from large back-painted glass panels to intricate mosaics. As a way to balance the modern cabinets and countertops, we decided on marble subway tile from TileBar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our main goals for the master bedroom were to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/bedroom-storage-style-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximize storage</a> and improve circulation. So the swing bedroom door was replaced with a pocket door, improving access to a long wall of closets that ended in a small custom-made vanity at the corner of the room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Leo and I found that all the time spent obsessing over the small details really paid off—it all came together as we had hoped and we were very happy, not only with our choices but with the quality of execution and expertise the Sweeten contractor and his team brought to the project. Most importantly, knowing Sweeten was following the project, and touching base with us periodically gave us peace of mind through the whole process.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Turn an old, run-down bathroom into something elegant and calming</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Mary Ann and Frank’s three-bedroom Upper West Side apartment had done its job since they had bought it in 1992.  But now, with their two kids grown and gone, the couple pulled the trigger on a long-planned master bathroom upgrade. “Our co-op building was built in 1929 and it was the bath from 1929<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></i>same tub, same tiles,” said Mary Ann, who works in publishing. Grime on the tiles wouldn’t budge and some tiles were no longer there at all. Paint peeled off the walls and with no vanity, shampoo bottles were always on prime display. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: To keep the costs down, the couple kept the original layout. But that was all they kept. What they wanted was a stylish sanctuary beginning with a hex tile bathroom. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hexagons were laid on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble</a> topped off the vanity for a refined look. The shower also has matching marble tiles. Their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> suggested painting, not tiling, the wall opposite the shower and vanity. Rather than feeling enclosed, the bathroom now feels “more like a room,” said Mary Ann, “and plus it would have been a lot of cleaning.” They did lose storage space in their master and hall bathroom, which they also renovated. However, a large vanity and two large mirrors with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> built into the wall that were added to the master bathroom made up for that. When you open each mirror, there is also another magnifying mirror. The vanity has six large drawers and two cabinets for storing toilet paper and cleaning supplies. &#8220;We were just going for a more calmer, less cluttered look,” said Mary Ann. “Now, everything is put away.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Mary Ann’s centerpiece is a walk-in shower so large “you can do yoga in it.” The old tub was decommissioned and replaced with a walk-in shower with glass walls. “It’s so much fun to take a shower now,” said Mary Ann.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">A loft apartment rediscovers its historic roots by exposing its beams, maximizing 11-foot ceilings, and bringing the walls down</span></h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Meg and Brett had grown comfortable with their rental—despite its tiny shower, inadequate climate control, and chronic water problems—but dreamed of something to call their own. Having searched for years without success, they finally landed on just the thing: a spacious loft apartment in Hamilton Heights with a history. They went to work restoring some of the industrial charm that previous owners had plastered over with drywall, and the result is a stunning combination of original wooden beams, salvage finds, and touches of warmth that make an apartment a home. Read on for Brett’s take on how he worked with Sweeten to create the ideal space for his growing family.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24990 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Hamilton Heights homeowner Brett</span></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had been renting in NYC in different neighborhoods for many years, including most recently, our rental of eight years at the corner of 63rd Street and 2nd Ave. We loved our rental, but it had its share of problems&#8230;it would heat up like an oven in the summer, and in winter, it was so cold we could see our breath in the living room. It flooded every other year, and we could hear honking almost 24/7. It was imperfect but it was comfortable, and we loved it. We thought about purchasing a place for many years, but every apartment we looked at was a step down from where we were. Then we found it…the perfect place in the perfect neighborhood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">&#8230;after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment! </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment we found was an 1,800-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath condo loft in the historic district of Hamilton Heights. In an old carriage house that had been converted to residential lofts, the building was one of the few remaining carriage houses left in the city. We can track its existence back to 1903 from old ads in the Tammany Times, but I am sure it was built before then.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The place had been renovated not too long ago and was finished nicely. It had everything we ever wanted, and had we moved in as is, it would have been a huge step up from our current place. Most people would have moved in and not changed a thing. Our friends, our parents, and our brokers all thought we were crazy to even touch it. But after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as our vision was concerned, we wanted our loft apartment to feel high-end, but not stuffy or fancy. It should have a modern and clean feel to it, while still being classic and forever. We wanted to feel like we were on vacation when we were at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This place had a lot of history and interest to it, but we felt that the previous owner covered up a lot of the historical aspects, and aimed to expose them literally and figuratively. We describe it as smashing-a-modern-apartment-into-a-barn because that is kind of what we did. Attention wasn&#8217;t paid to trends, design rules, or motifs. We picked what we liked, and things that would be forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love watching &#8220;<a href="https://youtu.be/t221YNSCFLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open House&#8221; NYC</a>, our normal weekend activity, and saw an ad for Sweeten come on. Knowing that work needed to be done on the place, we thought of this as a good sign and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/8578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed up on the site</a>. Looking through their bios and past work, we found a few contractors who we were matched with that we liked. After speaking to three on the phone, there was a good feeling with one Sweeten design/build firm. His pictures showed he could do nice work, and he seemed like a straight shooter. We met with him at his office and got a quote on the scope of work. My wife and I liked the Sweeten contractor and felt him to be honest. We never got another quote or met with another contractor. His price wasn’t cheap but I didn’t want cheap work. I wanted someone I knew would do the job right.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I discovered during this renovation that developers will often square things off and use preset sizes for things to make the job easier and cheaper. After we did some demo, we found a ton of extra storage space just behind the sheetrock in the kitchen—and built an 8-foot-tall <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry</a> into the wall to the left of the fridge. Don’t be afraid to knock a few holes in walls. It’s all going to be painted anyway. After all, ours ended up being floor-to-ceiling in the kitchen which rivals most suburban pantries. Lastly, we recessed all the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a> except pendants over the peninsula, which we replaced with classic handblown Simon Pierce light fixtures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the exposed brick in the living room—which had 11-foot-high ceilings—and looked to continue the theme. We walked around and knocked on the drywall—if it felt hollow, we put a hole through to see what was underneath. This method allowed us to find original beams and columns all over the apartment and expose them. The wooden beams were original to the carriage house, whereas the iron beams were installed to support the original structure at some point in the building’s history. Some of the beams had initials in them, and we even found a horsehair or two caught in the wood!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wood-burning fireplace was originally wrapped in an ugly stone, so we wrapped it in black steel and replaced the mantle with a natural soapstone. Behind the fireplace, we built a niche for all the electronics and hung a TV above the mantel. We stripped the yellow varnish off the wide-plank oak <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a> throughout the loft apartment and refinished them with an eco-friendly, non-toxic, two-stage fuming process. The ceiling was painted the color of the sky—Benjamin Moore Grey Sky—and recessed LED lighting was added. A large custom table was built for the space by RE-CO Brooklyn from a single tree that fell during Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I found the tall ladder in the boiler room of an old factory in the Bronx. I work for a company that owns a few buildings in Hunts Point, and there are generations of industries and companies that have come and gone in those buildings. In my downtime, I like to explore the old abandoned spaces. Sometimes you can find the coolest stuff if you aren’t afraid to get a little dirty. The ladder was blackened from the fumes and probably at least 40 years old. I sanded it down and now use it to reach for items and to add some vertical interest. For the plant hangers, I used various industrial parts I found at a supply store to create a way to attach and hang plants to the beam.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, we went for a classic look: white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> with Carrara marble countertops and backsplash, with pulls and knobs in silver. The original kitchen cabinets had a shiny yellow wood finish that was not our style, so they were stripped down and painted in a nice white. Various sections were distressed to better fit the style of the loft apartment. The counters and backsplash are 3.5-inch-thick Carrara marble—the distributor said it was too hard to deliver and install such a thick piece in one slab because of the weight. But we insisted and they had to use 10 men to bring it in and install it! We also enlarged the sink with a Kohler stainless steel model. The range is a Bertazzoni Pro. Next to the sink is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mini-fridge</a> that is stocked with the same items you would find in a hotel mini-fridge—even things I don’t like!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, in the master bath, we went with a large 4-inch <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hex tile</a> in Carrara marble, with a simple white subway tile on the walls to match. I found our sink at an old steel warehouse in the South Bronx—it was filled with debris and pigeon poop at the time but was in surprisingly good shape. It’s a 48-inch Kohler slop sink circa 1948, and our Sweeten contractor was able to create a custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> underneath to fit the unusual shape of the sink. Our contractor also custom-made the mirror above to match.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the kitchen, we found space behind walls in the bathroom and created three linen closets. This room also holds the thing that I’m most excited about in the whole renovation: the shower. It’s spacious and comfortable—I had to duck down to get into our old shower and I’m only 5’8” on a good day. My wife’s favorite thing about the entire renovation is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer/dryer</a>! I didn’t even have to ask what it was…at our old building, the washing machines looked so old, I swear they ran on steam power. Clothes would come out dirtier than when they went in.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom, we redid the floor-to-ceiling closets with custom wooden doors and hid a TV inside. We also added custom wood shutters to the windows, which accentuate the unique shape of the windows. They are super deep, tall and arched. Without many good options, we concluded this was the best way to address the arch without ruining the architectural interest of the windows. As for the rest of the bedroom, it feels very serene and relaxing. Sleep is important to my wife and me, and we wanted it to feel like a retreat from the city. We didn&#8217;t want any industrial elements in here. We wanted it to feel refined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the entire process, our Sweeten contractor stayed on budget, which was very important to us. He completed the project within the time frame we discussed, even though I kept adding more and more work. He was pleasant to work with and fixed every concern or problem I brought up. Even after the project was complete, he repeatedly checked in and fixed a problem or two that was missed during the renovation. Now that we’re done, I’d say that the hardest part was staying on budget with a project of this scope. We kept finding more things that we wanted to do. My advice to future renovators is to anticipate this and to make a list of things that need to be perfect. Don’t be afraid to move backwards or sideways. Better to take your time, and get what you want than rush and end up with something subpar.</p>
