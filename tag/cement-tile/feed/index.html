<h3>A fashionable—but not functional—period kitchen</h3>
<p>The kitchen was original from the 1930s and very Hollywood Art Deco. It was just one aspect we loved when we purchased our 1,400-square-foot co-op, located in a 1932 Spanish Revival building in Historic Filipinotown, a neighborhood near Los Angeles’ Echo Park.</p>
<div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" title="country-cottage-kitchen-butcher-block-countertop" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="white country cottage kitchen with patterened floor tiles and butcher block countertop and golden oak cabinets after renovation" width="1000" height="750" class="alignnone wp-image-51355 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-01-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-01-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Matt and I previously lived in a 600-square-foot apartment and never spent days hanging at home—it just didn’t have enough light and space. Looking for our next place, we realized that everything in our price range needed a large overhaul, or had been cheaply flipped and had an ugly poorly-designed kitchen.</p>
<h3>Seeking a fixer-upper kitchen</h3>
<p>I love to cook, and during our search, we’d decided that the sweet spot would be a place that was in good shape and had character but <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">needed a new kitchen</a>.</p>
<p>As first-time renovators, we figured the hardest parts would be finding a contractor, negotiating bids, and avoiding surprise hidden costs. When we found <em>the one</em> on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, it turned out our biggest challenge was actually <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not hiring an architect or designer</a> as well. I sketched the kitchen out on my word processor!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="golden-oak-cabinets-farmhouse-sink" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="golden oak kitchen cabinets with butcher block countertop and undermount farmhouse sink and white backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="750" class="alignnone wp-image-51359 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="undermount-farmhouse-sink-white-backsplash" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen windows over undermount farmhouse sink with black faucets and wooden countertop and white backsplash tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1333" class="alignnone wp-image-51366 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12-600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Thinking we would <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re-do the kitchen</a> right away, we purchased an induction hotplate and set it on the beautiful black-and-teal tile countertop. We found a basic fridge on Craigslist. We would also need to upgrade the unit’s electrical panel; we didn’t have the amps to run the hotplate and toaster simultaneously. When we first moved in, a kitchen wall had to be ripped out due to a leaky roof. It stayed that way until the renovation; it was rough in there!</p>
<h3>Flooring material for wet spaces</h3>
<p>We thought about trying to save the Art Deco details, especially the original tile countertops and the matching backsplash. But preserving the original aesthetic wasn’t an option. The counters weren’t the modern standard depth, so new appliances would not fit. We struggled with whether to go with deco tiles and white cabinets or scrap all that and let it be something modern. We went with the latter.</p>
<p>Going from the ground up, we discussed adding hardwood or cork flooring for a soft surface underfoot but decided against it. We wanted to make the kitchen contiguous with the laundry room, and we chose cement tile flooring to avoid worries about moisture. Another draw had to do with dirt. In our old apartment, we’d had terracotta tiled floors, which we loved, but the wide grout collected grime. The cement tile required narrower grout and seemed practical. It also brought a bold texture to our floors.</p>

<h3>Plywood cabinets and cement floor tile ground the kitchen</h3>
<p>Having ruled out natural wood for the floors, we were excited to use it for the cabinets. We feel intuitively drawn to wood and have chosen it for surfaces throughout our home, so we let that lead us. We went with plywood kitchen cabinets—it&#8217;s a cost-effective material, and we liked its functional aesthetic. Designing the layout for the custom base plywood cabinets was gratifying. Since we could dictate all dimensions, we spent time going over all of our kitchen wares and deciding how we wanted to store things. We’d measured the height of the coffee grinder and Chemex pitcher and knew which drawer they would live in long before the kitchen was built.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span>&#8220;Throughout the process, our Sweeten contractor was very communicative, which was lucky.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>We thought a lot about the upper cabinetry, too. We initially felt nervous about open shelving, thinking everything would get dusty. But in the end, we did it, mainly to save money, and it turned out to be a great choice to keep the visuals simple and open. It makes putting away dishes a breeze!</p>
<h3>Personalized features make it home</h3>
<p>The backsplash was also cost-contingent. We kept saying we’d do subway tile to save money—but decided on handmade, natural clay tiles that look so right with the plaster walls. Plastering the hood was another important detail for us; it became a way to draw the co-op’s original character into our modern design.</p>

<p>We didn’t agree on everything. My uphill battle was to convince Matt to spend the extra money to put in taps for filtered and boiling water. As the cook of the house and the one who drinks the most water, I felt strongly that this would pay off in convenience. Matt finally agreed, and it really has.</p>
<h3>Finishing touches for the laundry</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laundry room was another area</a> where plumbing was key, and our Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor got involved</a> there, too. We’d installed cabinets ourselves above the washer and dryer before starting the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen renovation</a>. However, the washer and dryer, which were included in the house purchase, had exposed hookups. We upgraded by having the contractor recess them into the wall. The dryer had been vented through a hole in the floor that looked like it was cut with a Sawzall, so we finished that, too. We invested in an on-demand hot-water heater and installed an $85 utility sink. Someday we’d like to get front-loading machines and put in a countertop to really pull that room together.</p>

<h3>Good communication with their general contractor</h3>
<p>Throughout the process, our Sweeten contractor was very communicative, which was lucky. When little things went wrong, he was <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">determined to fix them</a> and make us happy. We are grateful to the Sweeten team for helping us find him! We spent just <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under $56,000</a> on the whole project. I’m not sure we could have pulled it off had we not both been creative managers, but it was worth it to have a kitchen we designed exactly for ourselves.</p>
<p>The renovation has <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made our home livable</a> in a way we could have never foreseen. After being over budget and tired of eating out, it kind of worked for us that eating out had become less appealing. We got to stay home and cook.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>When Fabio and Melina won the bidding war on a two-bedroom Carnegie Hill apartment, they were amazed and delighted. With outdoor space, family-friendly amenities, and just one block from the new Second Avenue subway, it checked off all the right boxes. The only downside: it needed a thorough facelift and the clock was ticking on their rental apartment. Oh, and their baby was due any minute. Here’s how they juggled the ups and downs of renovating, while learning to be new parents—Melina gave birth to their son a month into the project!</i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22047 size-chrono" title="Carnegie Hill renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p><em>Guest post by Carnegie Hill homeowner Melina </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the lease of our functional but tiny, 550 square-foot, one-bedroom rental on the Upper East Side about to end and a baby boy on the way, the time came to try and buy a place. We set our hopes on a two-bedroom apartment in our neighborhood, ideally with great light and storage space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fast forward three months into our search and there were still no prospects. We were starting to lose hope! We went to every open house around us and looked at all options. Many of the apartments we visited were too expensive, too small, too dark, or way too far from any subway or daycare, which was our desired childcare plan. That is, until we visited a listing two blocks south of our rental and a block from the entrance of the new Second Avenue subway–whose opening, at the time, still sounded like a dream far in the future. The apartment itself was falling apart and looked straight out of “That ‘70s Show.” Only one family had occupied the home since the building was built 40 years ago, and no renovations had ever been done. Most of its walls were painted green, the living room had an entire wall covered in mirrors, and a popcorn ceiling ran throughout. However, the space was promising. A true two-bedroom on a high floor, with a large balcony off the living room, light (windows in every room!), and closet space. It came with basement storage, a bike room, a children’s playroom in-the-making, and a roof deck. Our only reservation was the need for a full renovation before moving in. Despite that, we made an offer, thinking we wouldn’t win the bidding war anyway. To our surprise, our best and almost unreasonable offer did.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22036 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-Before-02-1-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-Before-02 (1)" width="723" height="1085" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We found Sweeten on an online search and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6445">posted our project </a>to be matched with builders. We were nervous about finding a contractor who could understand our expectations and timing constraints. The lease on our rental was ending before the summer, and so our move-in date was not flexible. We had less than four months to complete our entire renovation project. We chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177">our Sweeten contractor</a> because we immediately felt we could trust him in getting the job done in time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21973 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21975 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-14-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-14" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The focus for our renovation was the kitchen and bathroom. Fabio and I both love to cook and wanted a space where we could work together at the same time. The small bathroom needed to feel less cluttered and gain storage space. Our contractor provided decisive support, validated our suggestions, and helped to define the details before starting the work. We wanted to make this apartment our own, and he was happy to accommodate our choices, but he also made sure they were practical. As soon as we closed on the apartment, the team went in and started the demolition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before construction, we spent a lot of time pulling together the look and materials from home and design websites, so we had a strong point of view on the style we were trying to achieve. Our material choices included Carrara marble, cement and ceramic tile, classic New York hex tile in the bath, Edison bulbs, and black and white cabinets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We opened up the kitchen entryway slightly to let additional light come through to the dining area. We opted for countertops on opposite sides to maximize prep space and to accommodate a full semi-professional espresso setup—Fabio is a coffee geek. Our Sweeten contractor helped us finalize our design with <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA cabinets</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We spend a great deal of time in the kitchen and didn’t want strong colors we may grow tired of quickly, and settled on black cabinets with patterned ceramic floor tiles to add interest. While we tried to stay within our budget as much as possible, we splurged on professional heavy-duty appliances. We went with a modern version of a rustic farmhouse sink and purchased copper cabinet pulls online. The new kitchen is fantastic—the storage space feels especially luxurious compared to our previous kitchens.</p>

<p>We kept the bathroom’s tub and had it re-enameled but replaced the sink, cabinetry, hardware, and had the floor and walls retiled. We used a gold, black and white color theme that coordinated with the light fixtures and cement floor tiles. To create storage space, we built a new partially recessed medicine cabinet hidden behind the door. There was no heat in the bathroom, and with long New York winters in mind, we added a small towel heater.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The flooring throughout the apartment needed to be replaced, and our contractor took us to his supplier for a selection of inexpensive but great-looking wood flooring. We went with a light-colored wood with dark veins to generate an interesting contrast. The shelves in the rooms’ closets were falling apart. Initially, we planned on using IKEA shelving to replace them but because they weren’t standard size, we had them custom-designed by <a href="https://www.californiaclosets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Closets</a> to optimize our storage space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21986 size-chrono" title="Carnegie Hill renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-18-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-18" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>Our son was born one month into the renovation, and we were able to trust our contractor and his colleagues to handle the work with limited supervision. As with most renovation projects, some of our plans fell through unexpectedly, but our contractor and his team made sure we stayed on track and resolved every issue quickly and efficiently. The renovation has been complete for almost a year, and we could not be happier with our new apartment. Thanks to our contractor and Sweeten, we got our dream home and moved in on schedule.</p>
<p>Thank you Melina and Fabio for sharing how a renovation can be completed with grace under time constraint. We hope you continue to enjoy your home!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A creative Brooklyn couple came to Sweeten with an enviable problem: they had a gorgeous townhouse on their hands, big on charm and original details, but a little low on the storage and conveniences that a modern, entrepreneurial family needs. <a href="https://cupofjo.com/2016/02/my-beauty-uniform-kavi-ahuja-moltz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kavi Ahuja Moltz </a>and David Seth Moltz, the fabulous duo behind the small batch perfume and cologne company <a href="https://dsanddurga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D. S. &amp; Durga</a>, loved the rich wood trim that framed each window and the inlaid wood floors that ground each room, but earlier renovations in the kitchen and bathrooms had replaced many original materials with a hodge-podge of finishes. Seeking the skills of a designer and contractor, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to Sweeten, a free service matching homeowners with contractors, and we found their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4877#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> to re-think space and feel in the kitchen and two bathrooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-island-undermount-sink" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48507 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07.jpg" alt="White kitchen island with undermount sink and multifunctional faucet facing kitchen with abstract backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="668" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span id="more-17681"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Clinton Hill home presented an open kitchen plan with a large center island that had been updated with telltale features in the last decade: subway tile and a mix of wood finishes had been fit into an archway in the kitchen and pre-war moldings with gothic-inspired edges framed the oversized windows and a fridge nook. Storage was limited to two strips of base cabinetry and the butcher block counters added a third wood finish to the original floors and architectural details. Updates in the bathroom were similarly out of sync with the home’s original design, and a mix of modern tile, faux wood finishes, and slim storage left this family without a lot of storage options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor set out to preserve the most striking original floor and molding details and also push elements of the home toward a highly inventive and contemporary aesthetic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brown-hardwood-floor-kitchen-bathroom-before" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48518 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1.jpg" alt="Brown hardwood floored open kitchen and bathroom with tempered shower glass door before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Without destroying any of those gorgeous hardwood floors, he addressed the most pressing of the to-dos first. The base cabinets were completely removed and replaced with a full wall of semi-gloss, flat front, white cabinetry from HenryBuilt with hidden hardware, framing the striking new <a href="https://www.subzero-wolf.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolf</a> stove. While they did lose the original wall pocket trimmed in molding that housed the fridge, the new <a href="https://henrybuilt.com/page/henrybuilt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HenryBuilt</a> cabinets are far better suited for pantry purposes, and the new fridge was re-located to the right of the stove, camouflaged seamlessly with paneling. White stone composite counters replaced the butcher’s block, and a larger island replaced the former, keeping a similar silhouette with a mahogany base and ample knee space for diners. The stainless undermount sink was also enlarged, with a dramatic multi-functional chrome faucet, a standard workhorse behind the scenes in most restaurants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The backsplash is where the real drama resides. White subway tiles were replaced with a kaleidoscope of black, gray, and white triangular tiles creating quite the abstract pop of modernity to the new kitchen that’s now a contemporary haven trimmed in pre-war luxe.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In each of the two bathrooms, the crew took a related design approach to tie in inspiration across eras, addressing the finishes without changing the footprint entirely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In one full bath, tile again takes center stage with cement <a href="https://www.marrakechdesign.se/dandelion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dandelion tile</a> in Lawn/Milk on the floors. These hex tiles with watercolor edges and abstract white lines depicting sunbursts replaced the previous, more subdued flooring. Simple white hex tile grounds the walk-in shower, and classic white subway tile stacked in a herringbone pattern extends up and around the walls. Frameless glass shower doors, a glossy lacquered double vanity with deep drawer storage, and a heated towel rack perfect this stylish high-low mix of materials. And because no detail was overlooked by this stylish couple, they opted for polished brass light fixtures to offset the muted tones and white on white textures.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kids’ bath, a parallel mix of white and gray shapes work equally simply to create a clean and bright space. White hex floor tile and contrasting gray grout is echoed with industrial white subway wall tile and more contrasting grout. Their Sweeten contractor made room for a new tub and double vanity, and added extra towel bar storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This week, we have a full bathroom renovation guest report in from Celeste G., a condo owner and marketing, brand building, and copywriting triple threat in Park Slope. Read on down for Celeste’s debrief on her Brooklyn bathroom before and after!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14659 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/celestebathroom2.jpg" alt="celeste park slope bathroom" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/celestebathroom2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/celestebathroom2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Homeowner guest post by Celeste G., Park Slope homeowner<span id="more-14416"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I purchased my one bedroom condo in Park Slope in 2008. It was new construction, which was great because I am the exact opposite of handy or DIY. The “design” of the apartment was standard for new construction buildings at the time: bamboo floors, limestone tile, and dark cherry cabinetry. I lived in the apartment for a few years before considering any cosmetic changes and around year three, I noticed that the limestone tiles in my bathroom had darkened in some spots. In fact, the tile had never been sealed and as I learned the hard way, limestone is extremely porous. Several failed cleaning experiments later, I had nearly ruined the color and texture of a small patch near the sink vanity. As a clean enthusiast, the sight of the floor drove me bananas, but I wasn’t ready to take on what felt like an overwhelming renovation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14446" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-011.png" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-01" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-011.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-011-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, I decided to replace all the bamboo floors in my apartment (why start small when practically moving out of your home is an option?!). Luckily this foray into renovation was successful and the change in flooring literally changed the entire look and feel of the whole place. I felt confident tackling my tiny bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did some research on what I might spend (why are toilets so expensive???) and asked my friends for contractor recommendations. My building required contractors with a certain amount of insurance, so I started looking beyond friend recommendations and luckily landed on Sweeten. I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a> and was matched with three contractors including <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a>. All I knew for sure was that I liked the idea of a gray/black/white graphical floor, and I definitely needed more storage space because clutter makes my eyes swim &#8212; during our first meeting, I felt that Paulina understood the general aesthetic I was interested in and suggested a number of possibilities to open up the small-ish space. I sent her a few pictures from Pinterest and she developed 3D models based on my bathroom’s measurements. For someone spatially challenged, the modeling was enormously helpful. I could see the transformation and make adjustments before touching a thing. For example, we initially thought gold hardware would elevate the bathroom’s overall look but once I saw it in the model, I opted to go with chrome instead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once we were decided on the 3D model, Paulina sourced floor and wall samples and sent me a photo of the type of wood planned for a custom vanity. I presented a lot of options to her and relied on her expertise for guidance. For example, a friend of mine replaced her bathroom sinks with <a href="https://www.corian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corian surfaces</a> and I really liked the seamlessness of it. I shared a photo with Paulina and she designed the sink and vanity with a beautiful, white Corian top, complete with side cutouts to add some dimension and visual interest. Honestly, I was unsure about the cutouts initially but after seeing it in the 3D model, I decided to give it a whirl.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14447" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-011.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-01" width="600" height="890" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-011.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-011-202x300.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14448" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-021.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-021.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-021-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main challenge with this bathroom was the lack of storage space. I asked Paulina for a deep medicine cabinet along with a good amount of storage space in the vanity. I got my wish in spades. As we were discussing options, I pointed out that there was no place for a trash bin. Paulina worked it into the design of the vanity so not only do I have space for a small trash bin, it’s also completely hidden from view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original inspiration for the renovation was again, the floor. I fell in love with a cement tile in a M.C. Escher-like pattern. Paulina ordered samples for us to review but expressed some second thoughts about the durability and appearance of that tile. Maybe two or three days later, she emailed me to say that she was concerned about this particular pick and suggested I look at some marble tile with a similar pattern at a showroom nearby. I’m so glad I took her up on it. The marble option, from <a href="https://www.walkerzanger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walker Zanger</a> (in Facet Ash), was not only more in line with the aesthetic I wanted but also less expensive and more durable. I kept my original tub and <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Bathroom-Toilets/category/429984/429204.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler toilet</a>, and framed the room in a new beveled, white subway tile. I kept the walls white and Paulina’s team installed a <a href="https://www.minkagroup.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minka-Lavery Downtown Edison lighting fixture</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14449" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-031.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-031.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-031-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The two weeks of actual renovation are a blur to me now. They seemed to go by very quickly and yet take forever. I was close enough to check on progress every day and Paulina’s team really did work fast. The transformation was fun to watch, even though I admittedly had a few panicked moments and doubts about the chair rail tile (why do I even know what this is?) and the vanity. I remember one email I sent Paulina after the vanity was installed. I spent maybe 10-15 minutes in the bathroom while it was still under construction trying to get the drawers to the vanity open, and then emailed to ask if the drawers would be easier to open when the bathroom was finished. It didn’t occur to me that the pulls hadn’t been installed yet. Thankfully, Paulina has a good sense of humor…!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few months later and I still love my new bathroom. When I think back to that stained limestone tile and cherry wood vanity, I can’t believe it took me seven years to switch it up.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Renovations can be painful. Sweeten takes the hassle and guesswork out of the process. Overall it was a very pleasant experience and we are thrilled with the end product.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">-Ben C., Brooklyn Heights homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What do you do when you realize that your bathroom is just not working for you anymore? Ben &amp; Therese&#8217;s Brooklyn Heights bathroom wasn&#8217;t even 10 years old before they recognized that the space was ugly, outdated, and felt cramped &#8212; even little Enzo (pictured above) didn&#8217;t want to bathe in what he regarded as a cheap, generic tub &#8212; it was time for an update.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple took a savvy approach, collecting enough inspiration and research online that, together, they were ultimately able to design the bathroom of their dreams and a space that would reflect their personal tastes. They even built a 3D model of their ideas using Google SketchUp to help them plan and visualize the space; according to Ben, &#8220;we didn’t want to leave anything to chance, and we wanted to make sure we utilized every square inch as best we could.&#8221; With their very real vision, Ben &amp; Therese were more than ready to renovate, so <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project on Sweeten</a> to be matched with a vetted general contractor who would help them finish the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10793" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_02.png" alt="brooklyn-heights-bathroom-renovation" width="475" height="462" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_02.png 594w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_02-300x292.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ben &amp; Therese moved forward with their first match who was just the right fit for the project, and in just 4 weeks, Sweeten Expert Aleks and his team were able transform the generic bath into the homeowners&#8217; inspired vision. Here&#8217;s their space before &amp; after:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10794 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03.png" alt="brooklyn-heights-bathroom-renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_03-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10795 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_04.png" alt="brooklyn-heights-bathroom-renovation" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_04.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SWEETEN_syncconstruction-benBathroom_04-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple took a universal ideal of clean, simple and modern, but made a space that is uniquely theirs by incorporating industrial elements like cement tile &amp; shower doors on sliding hardware, and adding a splash of color with Moroccan-inspired flooring tiles. Ben even says that it feels bigger and more open after renovating (a big plus in BK), not to mention that it&#8217;s much more functional. I love it, they love it, their friends love it, and little Enzo couldn&#8217;t be happier &#8212; sounds like a win!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great work to Aleks &amp; his team &#8212; and big congrats and many thanks to Ben, Therese &amp; Enzo!</p>
