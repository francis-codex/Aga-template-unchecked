<p>When COVID-19 hit last year, it seemed like the entire country went into shutdown. People started working from home, kids entered remote learning, and businesses had to pivot to figure out how to continue in this mainly virtual world.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> general contractors adjusted their routine by limiting the number of people on the construction project, wearing masks, using separate entrances so paths didn&#8217;t cross, and giving updates via teleconference, among other changes.</p>
<p>Technology was used to keep the process moving forward by conducting <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-renovate-safely-with-a-virtual-site-visit/">virtual site visits</a> on Sweeten&#8217;s platform. Homeowners were able to continue to receive estimates, hire their contractor, and get their projects slotted into their calendars.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> <span class="s1">matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p>Here, we look at some of the success stories of homeowners who decided that renovating during the pandemic was worthwhile—and achieved their goals.</p>
<h3>Gutting the interior and changing the exterior</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46957 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-08.jpg" alt="Image of a family portrait in front of fireplace" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46968 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-19.jpg" alt="Image of a house exterior renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-19-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-19-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46955 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-06.jpg" alt="Image of a family room with fireplace" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kirsty-House-06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kirsty and her family</a>, their renovation centered around adding square footage so that they were not “all on top of each other.” This goal would become even more poignant as the country shut down and the family found themselves spending a lot more time together. They worked with a Sweeten contractor to add 400 square feet to their home. This allowed them to enlarge the family room, master bath, and master bedroom.</p>
<p>The city of L.A. allowed residential construction to continue and precautions were followed while completing the renovation. Everyone on-site wore masks and the family moved out. The homeowner said on renovating during the shutdown, “We were limited by the pandemic on the things we could do as a family, so it made sense to turn our attention to something constructive.”</p>

<h3>Renovating to work-from-home</h3>

<p>Brooklyn homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/renovating-a-bathroom-kitchen-to-make-home-a-happier-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michele contacted Sweeten</a> before the pandemic hit to look for a contractor to overhaul her bathroom and kitchen. At the time, she had acquired a work-from-home position and found a few aspects that she found frustrating the more time she spent at home. Little did she—or any of us—know that working from home would become a lot of people’s reality practically overnight.</p>
<p><strong>“</strong>I had updated my home office to suit the remote role, but experiencing my out-of-date bathroom all day, every day, prompted me to get planning,” said Michele. She worked with her Sweeten contractor to make her “smallish” apartment accommodate her desired luxuries. Among them were a floor-to-ceiling pantry, a dishwasher, and plenty of storage space. Like many, customizing space to meet their daily schedules while at home is now more important than ever.</p>
<p>“We had to wait for the lockdown to lift and for my building to let the crew return, clearly articulating when they would arrive, and wearing masks as require.”</p>
<hr />
<h3>Planning for the future</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="laundry-area-subway-tiled-backsplash"  class="alignnone wp-image-48294 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mickey-Apt-After-12.jpg" alt="laundry area with washer dryer and white subway tiled backsplash and white kitchen cabinets after renovation" width="1000" height="642" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mickey-Apt-After-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mickey-Apt-After-12-300x193.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mickey-Apt-After-12-600x385.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47287 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-02.jpg" alt="Image of a white bathroom with walk-in shower" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Sweeten renovator <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-accessible-kitchen-and-bath-remodel-make-good-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mickey was looking ahead to retire</a> in the next couple of years and decided it was time to remodel his 1,000-square-foot apartment for his new lifestyle. With the help of his Sweeten contractor, he turned his kitchen into one l he&#8217;d admired in other people&#8217;s homes. He even <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/options-for-apartment-washers-and-dryers-4153000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">included a washer and dryer</a>. A walk-in shower replaced a tub for easier access for limited mobility.</p>
<p>He chose to stay in the apartment during the construction. This proved to be a challenge but one that outweighed the expense of renting a temporary space. Since COVID had shut down his gym, Mickey found alternatives for showering. In the end, it was worth it when he saw the final product!</p>

<h3>An NYC urban nest gets the job done</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="family-room-with-picture-window"  class="alignnone wp-image-48189 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor.jpg" alt="white family room with large picture window and white brick fireplace and tray ceiling with recessed lighting after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />When her family&#8217;s NYC studio got handed down to her, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/renovating-a-hand-me-down-co-op-during-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor knew the 320-square-foot</a> apartment wouldn&#8217;t be her forever home. The first step was overhauling the dark atmosphere and removing the many built-ins. She posted her project to find a contractor who would turn the space into a “light-filled, urban nest with an updated kitchen and bath.” She chose timeless materials and kept permanent fixtures in the kitchen and bathroom neutral. Resale appeal was the goal.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks into the process, New York City shut down. “Our Sweeten contractor was helpful in dealing with all the new health-related laws, as well as our co-op’s rules,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;As the pandemic escalated, only a few workers were allowed on-site, staying distanced; toward the end, it was only one worker at a time.”</p>
<p>Taylor ended up leaving the apartment and quarantining outside of Manhattan. Luckily, she was able to manage the construction from a distance. She discussed design choices over text, email, and FaceTime. “It was stressful, but I love what we ended up with!”</p>

<h3>A Chicago bathroom prepped for resale</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="double-vanity-sink-with-mirror"  class="alignnone wp-image-47486 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-03.jpg" alt="double vanity sink with marble countertop and large mirror and overhead wall mounted lights and towel bar above toilet after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/two-bathroom-renovation-for-resale-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten homeowner Krystin</a> was in the middle of updating her home in Chicago with the hopes of selling when the pandemic hit. Her Sweeten contractor remodeled her master bathroom along with the hallway bathroom. They were the areas in the home that needed the most help. Unfortunately, Krystin’s plans to sell the condo are on hold due to the pandemic. However, she’s optimistic that as things return to normal, her two new spaces will be real selling points.</p>

<h3>Moving forward with top contractor choices</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Sweeten, we know a lot about general contractors. One frequent question from homeowners involves how to prepare for a general contractor meeting. Site visits assess if a pro will be a good fit and to also secure the most precise estimate possible for the project.</p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">We recommend:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">reviewing three expert profiles that Sweeten matches you with</span></li>
<li class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">having at least three phone calls and site visits with the matches</span></li>
<li class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">requesting three estimates so you can make an informed decision</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">A phone call to discuss the project before the site visit may save you valuable time. It&#8217;s a good first introduction and gauges whether you&#8217;re both on the same page.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—</span>for free.</p>
<h4>Why it&#8217;s important to meet general contractors on-site</h4>
<p>Site visits are one of the first steps in a renovation. The meeting lasts 60–90 minutes on average and gives you a chance to interview experts who will help you get the job done. More importantly, it checks whether there&#8217;s chemistry and good communication between you and the contractor.</p>
<p>While Sweeten simplifies the search by matching vetted and licensed professionals to your project, you&#8217;ll still want to make an informed decision by having an in-person meeting. The visits should be with one contractor at a time. As you begin to schedule visits and solicit bids, here are a few ways you can prepare for a successful meeting with potential general contractors.

<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Preparing the details for a remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">To prepare for your site visit, keep the following on hand for easy reference: </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Anticipated start date</span></span></strong><span class="s1"><strong>:</strong> Include information about any flexibility, as well as variables that might affect/change the date.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Renovation goals</span></span></strong><span class="s1"><strong>:</strong> Be prepared to discuss your <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;must-haves&#8221; and &#8220;nice-to-haves&#8221;</a> items. You may request that bids include ways to remove items from the latter category if the budget is going over. Be specific about how you plan to use the new space, and how the old space falls short. If you need more storage, be specific about what you want to store there. Sharing this information with your contractor will help them create tailored solutions for you. If you are unsure of your end goals, let the contractor know. This will establish that you are looking for guidance, and the contractor can advise accordingly or suggest a designer or other expert to work in tandem with you.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Budget</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: Reiterate your budget so that the contractor can keep it in mind while discussing options. For example, this will affect whether they suggest custom or stock cabinets. You can also specify a labor versus material budget. If you plan to apply for a loan to finance your project, mention this upfront since it’ll add time to your project. At the end of your meeting, ask when you can expect an estimate.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Inspiration photos</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: One of the best ways for a contractor to get a sense of your vision is to provide a Pinterest page, photos on your phone, or magazine tearsheets.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Plans and sketches</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: If you have these, provide them. Even if it’s a rough sketch you did by hand on scrap paper, it can help the contractor understand your vision. If you did them in SketchUp or had an architect draw renderings already, have them ready.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Division of labor</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: Who will do what? If you plan to source the materials yourself, make that clear so that the expert does not include those estimates in the bid. Should you need a designer, an expediter, a project manager, or custom millwork, discuss who will be responsible for securing those services and whether they will be included. If you don’t yet know, make a point to discuss these options with the contractor.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>House rules and alteration agreement</strong></span></span><span class="s1">: If you live in a condo or a co-op building, ask your management company for these documents. Review them with or prior to meeting the contractor. Restrictions on working hours and building requirements can often affect the budget. Some co-op boards will not work with specific insurance carriers so <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check with your board</a>. Share this with the contractor prior to the site visit. You want to be sure that your top contractor choices can work in your building. </span></p>
<h3>How to prepare for a general contractor meeting</h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Questions for a general contractor</span></h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Keep in mind that many factors go into a smooth working relationship. Understanding as much as you can about the contractor’s experience, and how they work, is crucial. Try to have</span><span class="s1"> all decision makers present during the site visit. This will ensure that everyone is on the same page. </span><span class="s1">The following are examples of questions to ask: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">How often will they be on-site? </span><span class="s2">Who will oversee the work on a daily basis?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does the contractor take clients shopping for materials or provide shopping resources?<br />
</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">How often do they meet with clients to discuss the project&#8217;s progress?<br />
</span></li>
<li>Will the contractor send progress reports via email or by phone, and how often? If you have a preference, let them know this.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">How do they approach problems during an emergency? If a pipe should burst, what is the protocol?<br />
</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">What is the best way to reach them?<br />
</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ask for an estimate. The length of time to receive it depends on the size of the scope. Ask them what the ETA is for the estimate. An estimate for a one-room project that&#8217;s straightforward should take one week, while a gut renovation of a townhouse may take a month.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ask for references or read contractors&#8217; reviews on our site. For bigger projects, a contractor may take you on a walk-through of a project they completed for a past client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other topics to bring up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss with the contractor if you and your family plan on living/working in the space during the renovation. What will this arrangement look like?</li>
<li>Share any important dates that affect the completion date, such as family coming to visit. Will the project be completed by then? If not, what is the plan?</li>
<li>Inquire how the contractor&#8217;s company is set up. Do they have more than one project happening at once?</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Communication is key</span></h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Like all great matches, there is a lot that can’t be determined on paper. Face-to-face meetings are not only an opportunity for the contractors to get a sense of the scope of your project and the actual site conditions but also for you to get to know them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two of you will be working closely together for the duration of the project. It’s important that you feel the contractor understands where you are coming from and the vision you want to execute. Having a contractor who&#8217;s had similar experiences in handling the scope you are presenting is more important than whether they&#8217;ve done work in your neighborhood. How to prepare for a general contractor meeting also includes listening to your “gut feeling.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your site visit is a chance to interview an individual who will become a key part of your life for the next few weeks to months. You will rely on them to make decisions when you’re not available, but also to know when a discussion is necessary before taking action. So consider these questions as you’re getting to know the contractor during the site visit:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does this person communicate clearly and effectively?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Do they have a clear understanding of what I need, and can they provide it?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Do I feel supported in my decision-making?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does it seem like the contractor will be responsive and organized throughout the process?</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Schedule a bid-leveling call</span></h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">After the walk-through, take the time to sit down and debrief. If you go over the full scope of the work and ask for the contractor&#8217;s feedback on your ideas, this will create a firm foundation for working together.</span></p>
<p>When all estimates are in hand, schedule a one-on-one <a href="https://sweeten.com/bid-leveling-call-for-renovation-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid leveling call</a> with Sweeten to help compare them. Estimates are not universal and can differ in terminology, organization, and basic assumptions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This week we&#8217;re in the home of interior designer Katherine Hammond to check out the newest addition to her lovely Brooklyn Brownstone. After hearing about us from a friend, Katherine posted on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> seeking a contractor to build the <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/built-in-floating-desk-for-home-office-Prospect-Heights-Brooklyn-NY-awarded-to-contractor/510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom floating desk</a> she had designed. We matched her up with Nick Dillon of <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick Knacks Creative Interiors</a>, who worked with the designer to build and install her floating-concept desk. When the project was completed, Katherine reported that Nick was a &#8216;dream to work with&#8217; &#8211;and, as a bonus to us, she even ended up becoming a member of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> network with her company <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine Hammond Interiors</a>!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6011 size-full mb-24" title="01_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/01_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="418" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/01_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/01_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> </a>Here&#8217;s a shot of the space when <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/built-in-floating-desk-for-home-office-Prospect-Heights-Brooklyn-NY-awarded-to-contractor/510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine posted her project.</p>
<p><span id="more-6009"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6012 mb-24 size-full" title="02_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_theSweeten_floatingdesk-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />And here&#8217;s the transformed space! Katherine&#8217;s desk spans the length of the wall and is built-in for a floating effect, rather than being held up by vertical structural elements. Katherine explained that Nick advised her in the desk&#8217;s structural design, adding 3 thin steel brackets at different intervals across the span of the desk. In the center-back, the desk features a linear opening for cords so that items can be plugged in neatly and also moved from side to side. Beneath the opening, the cords are run through a hollow channel and straight to a power source which was relocated by NKCI for this purpose. These details allow Katherine can keep her desk as cord-free as possible!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6031 mb-24 size-full" title="03_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/03_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/03_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/03_theSweeten_floatingdesk1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Here&#8217;s Nick Dillon, owner of Nick Knacks Creative Interiors, on site during the desk installation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6014 size-full" title="04_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="418" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The desk was designed to be tucked away in the alcove behind this headboard. Like much of this Brooklyn Brownstone interior, the headboard, which doubles as a bookcase on the other side, was designed and built by Katherine and her father. Katherine consulted Francois Chambard of <a href="https://umproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UM Project</a>, an innovative furniture design co., for construction detailing to ensure a minimal look.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6015 mb-24 size-full" title="05_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/05_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/05_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/05_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> When Nick &amp; his crew came to install the desk (which they built off-site), Nick did his usual, <a href="/2012/06/21/site-visit-w-nick-knacks-creative-interiors-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very meticulous prep-work</a> in order to ensure that none of Katherine&#8217;s belongings were damaged.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6016 mb-24 size-full" title="06_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/06_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/06_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/06_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> We love how clean and minimal the design is &#8211;and while we can only see a glimpse of the desk from around the corner, we can still get a sense of its conceptual lightness.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6017 mb-24 size-full" title="07_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/07_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Here&#8217;s the designer, Katherine Hammond. Once her desk was in place, Katherine painted a few layers of <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magnetic paint primer</a> onto the wall above. Now her inspirations can also float (without damaging the wall!). Covering the magnetic layer is Benjamin Moore&#8217;s <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/for-painting-contractors/paint-products/satin-impervo-alkyd-low-lustre-paint#advs=0&amp;tab=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Satin Impervo</a>, which was also used on the desk.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6029 mb-24 size-full" title="09_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/09_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/09_theSweeten_floatingdesk1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/09_theSweeten_floatingdesk1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The desktop and drawer faces were built with MDF then painted, while the drawer interiors feature the natural grain and texture of finished plywood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6030 mb-24 size-full" title="10_theSweeten_floatingdesk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg" alt="custom-floating-desk-brooklyn" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10_theSweeten_floatingdesk.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10_theSweeten_floatingdesk-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />We couldn&#8217;t be happier to have found the perfect match for Katherine&#8217;s project! Many thanks to Nick, Dawn &amp; team at Nick Knacks Creative Interiors, and to Katherine of Katherine Hammond Interiors.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30927" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Yityng-Closet-WineBar" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p>This week we stopped in to see a finished project that was awarded to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>. The homeowners converted their under-stair closet space into a personal wine bar in an apartment on the Upper West Side. The new bar-topped niche is the perfect place to store and display the couples&#8217; wine collection, and it also doubles as a breakfast bar, making it an expansion of their small galley kitchen. Happy with their new space, the homeowners told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our contractor was very professional, contactable (important!), and has great suggestions. [We] would definitely recommend his team.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the project from start to finish.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19539" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-01.png" alt="sweeten_winebar-before-01" width="600" height="804" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-01.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-01-224x300.png 224w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Here is the photo the homeowners included when <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project to Sweeten</a> showing their double-door, under-stair closet space. The closet would be just the right fit for a wine cooler, cabinet, and wall-mounted shelving.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19540" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-02.png" alt="sweeten_winebar-before-02" width="600" height="274" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-02.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-02-300x137.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The couple already had some ideas in mind for wood shelving. Here are some of their inspiration images which they also posted to their project on Sweeten.</p>
<p><span id="more-5187"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19544" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-04.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-during-04" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-04-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The work began last month when their contractor cleared out the space, giving it smooth walls, fresh paint, and wired new lighting for the bar.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19542" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-during-02" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-02-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The next step was to assemble and install the small cabinet and wine-cooler. The homeowners chose this cabinet from the <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martha Stewart</a> collection available at Home Depot the style is Weston in Persian Grey.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19546 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-02" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-02-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19553 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-01-1.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-01" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-01-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Here is the finished view &#8211;we love the clever use of space! As well as the pop of color added by the red Tabouret stools, available on <a href="https://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Tabouret-24-inch-Red-Metal-Counter-Stools-Set-of-2/5095629/product.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Overstock</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19547" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-03.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-03" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-03-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The homeowners chose an elegant bartop in Carrara marble, also available through <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Kitchen-Countertops-Backsplashes-Countertop-Samples/Stonemark-Granite/N-5yc1vZc3boZb0i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>. Above, wine bottles are displayed on reclaimed wood shelving from <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West Elm</a>. The homeowners told us that they opted against custom shelving when they found these attractive shelves for such a great price. However, their contractor pointed out that the iron shelf brackets are a perfect match to the apartment&#8217;s stair railing—so, in the end, these off-the-shelf shelves actually appear customized.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19548" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-04.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-04" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-04-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>New lamps with dimmers were also added. We love the hand-blown look of the pendants, similar to this glass pendant available at <a href="https://www.potterybarn.com/products/clift-seeded-glass-pendant/?pkey=cchandeliers-pendants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pottery Barn</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19549" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-05.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-05" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-05-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Sometimes we forget how essential our storage is &#8211;they&#8217;ve got just enough cabinet space to keep the niche looking clean and stylish, with all the extras stowed away.</p>
<p><em>Many thanks to the homeowners for sharing their awesome new wine bar!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we&#8217;re catching up with another one of our new GC&#8217;s &#8212;<a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Nick Knacks Creative Interiors</a> is a husband-wife team lead by Nick &amp; Dawn Dillon. The homeowners (a pair of young, newly-wed professionals) chose Nick Knacks after interviewing 7 other contractors for this project which included renovating both a master (full) bath and a half bath in their Upper West Side home. Nick has a knack for details, so we&#8217;ve broken down the nitty-gritty on just the master bath makeover.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nicknackbefore-22.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3502" title="nicknackbefore 2" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nicknackbefore-22.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nicknackbefore-22.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nicknackbefore-22-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>The Nick Knacks team did a complete gut of the bathroom space to discover rotted flooring along with old plumbing lines and pipes that would have to be re-routed in order to realize its new design. After re-routing the plumbing where necessary, they upgraded all of the wiring to code, also adding recessed ceiling lights, 2 vanity light fixtures, a silent vent fan, and designated dimmer switches&#8230; Then onto the details below! <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_011.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3503" title="nickknacks_01" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_011.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_011.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_011-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>Nick always stresses the importance of proper site prep &#8212; for this project, his team spent an entire day protecting surfaces, setting up equipment &amp;  preliminary building materials to create a proper construction zone (which was also 99% dust free!). <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_021.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3504" title="nickknacks_02" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_021.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_021.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_021-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>Here&#8217;s a first view into the renovated master bath. Nick&#8217;s design featured classic white beveled-edge subway tiles and <a href="https://store.benjaminmoore.com/storefront/shop-by-product/interior-paints/aura-interior-paint/prodPRM24.html?sbcColor=2033_70" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Moore&#8217;s Aura Sweet Honeydew Melon</a> on the walls, as well as framed inset medicine cabinets from <a href="https://rh.com/catalog/category/products.jsp?link=MedicineCabinets&amp;categoryId=cat1520041" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Restoration Hardware</a>, and a new granite top for the vanity. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3505" title="nickknacks_03" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>When it came to the bathroom cabinets, Nick worked closely with these homeowners to come up with a custom solution that was &#8220;exactly it.&#8221; Nick did the design, fabrication, installation and wood staining of the double sink base cabinet (above) as well as a floating sink base and vertical storage cabinets in the half bath. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3500" title="nickknacks_04" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>Nick&#8217;s eye for details is also found in the finish of the window sill and tub ledge where he matched the granite used on the vanity. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3501" title="nickknacks_05" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>He also chose lighting and bath fixtures in polished chrome, including faucet and shower fittings from the <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Collections-Purist/category/430068/430062.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler Purist Collection</a>. The floors and tub side were tiled with these unglazed porcelain in <a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/72620612710977408/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linosa by Basaltina</a>.</p>
<p>Nick says that the homeowners were so pleased with the bathrooms that they added a custom bedroom closet to the scope of the original project. Great work and many thanks to Nick &amp; Dawn!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we were invited to tour the beautiful new Prospect Heights eatery, <a href="https://elbertarestaurant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elberta</a>, designed by Anishka and Niya of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ishka Designs</a>. We were excited to learn more about another great business in Brooklyn after our recent small biz story slam night. We&#8217;re also thrilled to see an increasing number of small business owners posting their projects on our main site&#8230;a <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/Bring-the-Vibe-restaurant-West-Village-New-York-NY-looking-for-estimates/601#details">restaurant</a>, an office and a shuffleboard court! For this project, the designers worked alongside the business owners to give a sophisticated makeover to the former Velvet Peach Cafe. Now the space, the mood, and the menu are all distinctly a part of the conceptual character of Elberta.</p>

The designers sourced the fixtures on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/SouthernLightsTN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">etsy</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_4155" style="width: 570px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4155" class="size-full wp-image-4155 mb-24" title="Elbert Restaurant - Ishka Designs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-4155" class="wp-caption-text">Near the back of the space, gold &amp; white wallpaper in a floral motif adds a touch of femininity. From this view we can get a sense of how the designers worked in layers of texture &amp; contrasting colors to create Elberta&#8217;s mood. The brick wall was painted to match the white of the wallpaper using Mountain Peak White from the Natura line by Benjamin Moore.</p></div>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-4156 mb-24" title="Elbert Restaurant - Ishka Designs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>One of the most important features and the inevitable centerpiece of the bar/restaurant was the bar top itself. The designers selected a sustainable surface by <a href="https://torzosurfaces.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TorZo</a>, made from sorghum stalks. And for the bar face, glass panels were mounted over a white surface.</p>

<h3>Transforming a plain dirt backyard</h3>
<p>“[W]e essentially had a patch of dirt (blank slate) and wanted to create an area that we could enjoy and use to entertain during the warmer months, aka our own oasis within Brooklyn.” said Vic.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a short-term fencing solution had been put in place between the adjacent yards.</p>

<h3>Creating a Brooklyn oasis for entertaining</h3>
<p>A new retaining wall construction wraps across two edges of the yard. The retaining wall intersecting with the home’s exterior wall grows bamboo plantings to reinforce the 30″ elevation difference between Ally &amp; Vic’s yard and their neighbor’s. Without the new retaining wall in place, the neighbor’s yard would have eroded into Ally’s &amp; Vic’s.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their fieldstone retaining wall is planted with hydrangea, azalea, bamboo, forsythia &amp; irises.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sweeten eliminated the need and hassle of checking and double checking contractor references as well as eliminating the worry of what type of quality work we would be receiving,” said Vic. “We were very comfortable with Sweeten’s vetting process for contractors, which enabled us to focus on what we wanted done,” said Vic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I cannot say enough good things about our Sweeten contractor. They were everything you would hope for out of a contractor. Honest, trustworthy, timely, efficient, communicative, helpful, competitively priced,” he concluded.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we met up with Nick Dillon and his crew at Nick Knacks Creative Interiors. The guys are off to a good start on this residential lighting project in South Williamsburg, which they were awarded via <a href="http://sweeten.com">Sweeten</a>. For the homeowners, a thorough revamp of the lighting scheme in their 1400 sqft home all started with one dark closet. In addition to the closet, not a single one of their 3 bedrooms nor the living and dining spaces was equipped with overhead lighting. Nick worked closely with the homeowners to come up with the best lighting solutions for each space. In order to finish the job, they&#8217;ll also be replacing the existing, standard ceiling-mounted hallway fixtures with something a little more stylish.</p>

Here he is on day 1 prepping the guest bedroom with one of his crew members.<span id="more-3820"></span> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3823" title="03_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Here&#8217;s an example of a dark corner in the living space that really needed some overhead light. Nick helped the homeowners come up with a track light system that will fit the space perfectly. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/04_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3824" title="04_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/04_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/04_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/04_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>The team started work in the living and dining areas. In only a matter of a few hours they&#8217;d drawn electricity through to the new 3-way switches and fixture locations, and by the end of the first day the tracks were already installed. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/05_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3825" title="05_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/05_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/05_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/05_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Here&#8217;s where they added a switch location and have drawn power through. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/06_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3826" title="06_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/06_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/06_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/06_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>We loved the brushed steel tracks &amp; fixtures these homeowners chose for the living room. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/07_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3827" title="07_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/07_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/07_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/07_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Nick suggested 3-way switches for the spacious, open living / dining space, and they installed these Lutron Maestro digital dimmers (600 Watts). <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/08_theSweeten_NickKnacks.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3828" title="08_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/08_theSweeten_NickKnacks.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/08_theSweeten_NickKnacks.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/08_theSweeten_NickKnacks-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>On our second visit we could see more of Nick&#8217;s systematic style. Back in the dining space, the guys had installed &#8220;pigtail&#8221; lamps in place of the future fixture, which will be an industrial-style chandelier from Rejuvenation. Nick said these dangling pigtail lights represent where the new electrical connections had been made and properly secured. Next, the cuts to the ceiling (and walls) will need to be patched with drywall, then plastered and painted, before the final fixtures are installed. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/09_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3829" title="09_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/09_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/09_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/09_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>After the living / dining spaces, Nick and his crew moved into the guest bedroom and office, leaving more pigtails behind until the ceiling has been mended.</p>
<p>At this point, they&#8217;re almost halfway finished with this 7-day job. Next they&#8217;ll be working on a new entryway chandelier and the master bedroom. We can&#8217;t wait to see all the new fixtures installed!</p>

It&#8217;s such a cool yet simple idea that lots of people took notice, including <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/good-idea-repurposed-countertop-shelving-167858" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apartment Therapy</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.annesage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The City Sage</a>.</p>

<p>Amanda explained,</p>
<h3>&#8220;[theSweeten] took the guesswork out of finding the right person for the job. Jon of Ecostruct was trustworthy, reliable, easy to get ahold of and experienced with the kind of work we needed done. We are thrilled with how the shelves turned out. They look exactly like the inspiration photo we gave Jon, and totally transformed the room.&#8221;</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the whole process:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we caught up with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a> who is working on an outdoor project, that he was <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/Full-Duplex-Apartment-Repaint-Brooklyn-NY-looking-for-estimates/406#details">awarded via Sweeten</a>, in Fort Greene. This Brooklyn backyard was definitely ready for a makeover, but when the contractor initially reviewed the project, he also realized that they would have to address the non-glamourous issue of soil erosion. A fence had been put up to separate this yard from the neighbor&#8217;s yard, however with a grade difference of 30 inches the existing construction fell short of a realistic, long-term solution.</p>
<p>In order to secure the boundary, they built a field stone retaining wall and have begun the process of laying down a bluestone patio. In the coming weeks, they will fill the retaining areas with plantings, including hydrangea, azalea, bamboo, forsythia &amp; irises and plant grass seed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we&#8217;re previewing a couple of projects being completed by members of theSweeten network. Both renovations are still early on in the construction phase, but we&#8217;re so excited about them that we had to share!</p>
<p>First up is this retrofit with <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSDO</a> (you may remember their awesome work from this post). Adam Glickman &amp; Lauren Schlesinger invited us out to Williamsburg to check out the progress on their adaptive re-use of a former Paper Doily Factory. The 7,000 sqft structure will soon have two apartments on the upper level; the new home of the <a href="https://www.wnns.org/donations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Williamsburg Neighborhood Nursery School</a> will be on the ground floor.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/560_GSDO_00.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3482 mb-24" title="560_GSDO_00" src="http:/sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/560_GSDO_00.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/560_GSDO_00.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/560_GSDO_00-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Lauren &amp; Adam of GSDO <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GSDO_01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3450 mb-24" title="GSDO_01" src="http:/sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GSDO_01.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GSDO_01.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GSDO_01-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Everyone was hard at work on the nursery school &#8212; soon this space will be full of 4 year olds! <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7935.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3452 mb-24" title="IMG_7935" src="http:/sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7935.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7935.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7935-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Upstairs, a bathroom plan is tacked up in the first apartment. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7912.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3451 mb-24" title="IMG_7912" src="http:/sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7912.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7912.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7912-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Six North-facing windows inside the second apartment wash the space with a lovely, even light. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7984.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3453 mb-24" title="IMG_7984" src="http:/sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7984.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7984.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7984-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Shiny new windows are already in. Can&#8217;t wait to see what else is in store for this former paper doily factory (circa 1902)!</p>
<p>Second on the list is another retrofit with Peter Maslow of <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maslow Interiors</a>. Peter has just gutted this 1000 sqft  home in the West Village and is getting started building the new plan. The former 2 bed, 1 bath will be transformed into an oversized 1 bedroom with both a full and a half-bath.  Peter is also relocating the entire kitchen, which, after the renovation is completed, will open onto a living room / library. And like the last project we saw from Peter, this one will also include  some unique finishes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The weather is just right this week for catching up on site with our friend Corey Hutson of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/680" target="_blank">Hutson Landscape Design LLC</a>. With Spring in the air, we asked Corey what he would be looking forward to most this season. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My absolute favorite are new rooftop garden designs, where I can do something truly unique. I love incorporating outdoor kitchens, showers and customizing the space to the clients&#8217; needs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Corey also told us that regardless of the project type, the most rewarding aspect is always the installation. Below, we visited with him during one of these installations. You can really see the transformation that Hutson Landscape Design team brings to this Madison Ave flower bed.</p>

For those of you who watch &#8220;Selling New York&#8221; you might have seen her on this <a href="https://corenyc.com/blog/2012/03/5-things-you-didnt-see-on-this-weeks-selling-new-york-12/">recent episode</a>.</p>
<p>Susan knew exactly what she wanted for this Midtown apartment. All she needed was the right person to make it happen &#8211;take a look below!</p>
<div id="attachment_3174" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/large1.jpg"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3174" class="size-full wp-image-3235" title="large" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/large1.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="388" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/large1.jpg 550w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/large1-300x212.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3174" class="wp-caption-text">Here is the sketch that the Susan provided.</p></div>

<p>It&#8217;s been a busy week at Forever Construction &amp; Design, Inc. They just wrapped up two projects, one, a studio renovation in Midtown and the other an office in Chelsea . We met with Harry Grahm owner of Forever Construction &amp; Design to get the scoop.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/New-office-Chelsea-New-York-NY-awarded-to-contractor/364#details"> first project </a>was one that Forever Construction &amp; Design was connected to via theSweeten. The company, <a href="https://www.fanbridge.com/">Fanbridge,</a> needed a very quick office renovation to minimize the interruption to their growing team. They needed to remove some walls and add glass inserts to others, change some of the lighting, refinish the floors and then a fresh coat of paint on everything.</p>

<dd><span class="img-label"> FanBridge was busy moving in when we were there. Harry&#8217;s work was done and they couldn&#8217;t have been happier.</span></dd>

<p>Here&#8217;s what Noah Dinkin the Co-Founder of FanBridge said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Harry and his crew came through for us 100%.  Everything was handled not only professionally, but on time and in budget.  Since we&#8217;ve moved in, Harry has remained available for any small fixes we hadn&#8217;t anticipated.  All in all, both theSweeten and Forever Design were totally positive experiences and highly recommended.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Awesome Thanks Noah!</p>
<p>For the studio Harry &amp; his team worked closely with the clients&#8217; concerns and budget to give this studio apartment a thorough upgrade which included an all-new kitchen, bathroom updates, new storage solutions, lighting &amp; hardware, fresh paint &amp; refinished hardwoods. To keep within budget the homeowners went with a great alternative to skim coating and  pre-fab cabinetry rather than custom.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/foreverdesign11.jpg"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-2794 mb-0" title="foreverdesign11" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/foreverdesign11.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/foreverdesign11.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/foreverdesign11-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Harry let me in on a little industry secret:  rather than skim coating, the crew sanded down the studio walls to remove blemishes, then chose a paint in a matte finish which absorbs light to hide imperfections. The best part&#8211;this worthwhile alternative can be a serious money-saver!</p>
<p>Next week we&#8217;ll have the &#8216;after&#8217; photos for from this project. Also there is something wacky going on with our blog, we&#8217;ll have it fix asap.</p>
