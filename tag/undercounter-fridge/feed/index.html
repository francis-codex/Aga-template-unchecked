										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>To outfit this crowd-pleaser, choose the right spot to build; add a good grill and other outdoor kitchen appliances</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25421 size-chrono" title="outdoor kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-723x482.jpg" alt="outdoor kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>(Above) This Kalamazoo outdoor kitchen features a built-in grill, weather-tight cabinets, refrigerator drawers, and a pizza oven sitting on the countertop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to eat out more often, but hate spending a fortune on restaurants, you should consider an outdoor kitchen. While you can spend almost as much on an <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/outdoor-kitchen-patio-ideas/">outdoor kitchen</a> as your indoor one, it’ll ultimately add resale value to your home. In a recent study, the National Association of Home Builders reported that outdoor kitchens add at least 100 percent of their value to a home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make the most of your outdoor kitchen, consider carefully these points:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Enhance your outdoor kitchen space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work with your contractor on finding the ideal location to build out your kitchen. Classic materials like brick, stone, or stucco can work nicely with many architectural styles of a home. These materials work especially well with older homes—and appear integrated.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Make your outdoor kitchen comfortable</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Allow room for dining and lounging both before and after the meal. You&#8217;ll need a shady or covered area paved with stone or wood to support furniture. You also want to add lighting for the dining and seating area, plus the kitchen area. This way, you&#8217;ll enjoy the space after sundown, while having an <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/entertaining-kitchens/">open plan that keeps the cook near the guests</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Pick outdoor kitchen appliances wisely</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Buy only what you know you will really use. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/">Avoid fixtures that serve only one function, unless you will use them regularly</a>. If your family loves pizza, by all means, add the pizza oven. If you entertain frequently, you can use a warming drawer. But do you really need that smoker?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Invest in high-quality outdoor kitchen materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything that goes into your outdoor kitchen should be made to work outdoors. But, still, everything you have installed will remain outside year-round, so it needs to be able to withstand changing weather. Buy from brands with national reputations so you can get a customer service person when you need one, including on the weekend. Also, <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-ways-care-renovated-home/">check the warranties</a> to make certain the company will back up their products.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Expect the unexpected</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At some point, an appliance or pipe will have to be repaired or possibly replaced. Work with your contractor to design installation so that electrical, gas, and water can be easily reached for repair or adjustment, if needed, without breaking down any beautiful stone surround or concrete foundation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Plan the setup and location of your outdoor kitchen</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your setup can be built-in or freestanding, depending on its location in relation to the structure of your house. Freestanding is quicker to get up and running, and you can take some features (like the grill) with you, should you move. However, built-in gives a more designed look and allows for optional but important features like a sink. ”If they are relatively close together, an outdoor kitchen can utilize the indoor kitchen’s capabilities, such as prep space and storage,” says Russ Faulk, chief designer and head of product for <a href="https://kalamazoogourmet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kalamazoo Outdoor Gourmet</a>, a manufacturer of outdoor kitchen appliances. “Conversely, a fully independent outdoor kitchen with refrigeration, warming cabinets and cabinetry is more self-reliant, but will require more space and connections for gas, water, and electricity.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are also outdoor kitchen appliance “kits” from companies like EP Henry. These include everything—the grill, cabinets, countertop, even bricks for the surrounding structure, plus a sink. Only experienced DIYers should put this combo together and will need to pull all the permits for construction and utilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the location of a built-in kitchen, if you place it against an outer wall of your house, you won’t have to run water and gas lines as far as if you were to locate it some further distance within the yard. You will, however, likely need a <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/">ventilation hood to prevent cooking smells from drifting</a> into your house. Work with an experienced contractor who can help you maximize your budget by finding the best location for easy utility access. He or she will also be able to tell you if you need that vent hood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Location (and climate) will also be a factor as to whether your outdoor kitchen grill station should be sheltered or exposed. Even appliances made for outdoor use shouldn&#8217;t be exposed to driving rain or snow, or prolonged, sub-zero temperatures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Always check to see if a permit is necessary before starting your outdoor kitchen project,” advises Russ. Your contractor can handle this, as he or she should be highly knowledgeable about local codes. These codes would include easement, permeable surface requirements, water restrictions, and height restrictions. Besides getting help with all those permits, learn about the other benefits of working with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed contractor</a> on your outdoor kitchen project.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choosing the right features</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The outdoor kitchen can be as large and tricked out as your space and budget will allow, but to make it fully functional, you will need to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition/">outfit it like you do the indoor kitchen</a>, with designated areas for prep, cooking, and clean-up, as well as dining and hanging out.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: The grill</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the center of any kitchen is the stove or, in this case, an outdoor kitchen grill.  Outdoors kitchen grills can be as sophisticated as you want, with two, three, or five burners, plus an accompanying warming drawer, side burners, and pizza oven. Confirm that whatever outdoor grill you choose is from an established manufacturer that specializes in grills and offers a solid warranty.  If you’re in the market for a freestanding outdoor kitchen grill, look at companies like KitchenAid, Dacor, and Monogram. These brands are known for their indoor cooking appliances, and also offer outdoor gas-operated products. Their outdoor products have modern combos of multiple burners and side grills, which let you cook several items simultaneously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Manufacturers devoted just to grills, like Weber, also offer plenty of choice for both freestanding and built-ins. Check that the area below the grill can handle the grill&#8217;s weight, and the heat it will emit, as well as any sparks that might fly out. The counter or workspace should be adjacent to the grill and burners. Make sure you can sanitize it for food preparation. “Keep a buffer zone between hot grills, ovens or cooktops and any people,” says Russ, who recommends a minimum of 9 inches of countertop extension behind and to the sides of all hot appliances.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: A fridge or freezer</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You probably don’t need a full-size fridge outside. An under-counter version will do the trick to chill protein until cook time, while keeping drinks cold. If you have the room, you could enjoy two fridges, one for food and one for beverages. The most common width for under-counter models is 24 inches, but 21- and 18-inch versions, as well as drawers, are available from major commercial fridge makers like Summit. Expect to pay $1,000 to $2,000 (for a double-drawer version)—as much as a grill. Make sure the model you buy is UL-listed and rated food-safe for outdoor use.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: Sinks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A sink, while not mandatory, makes outdoor entertaining much easier. You&#8217;ll be able to rinse hands and wash dishes, so you don’t have to take dirty dishes back into the house, or fill up a water pitcher. You&#8217;ll just need a water line connected to your home water supply, or a hook-up through a hose if you just need cold water. You’ll want weather-resistant 16-gauge stainless-steel for the sink. Then ask yourself, single or double basin? Splurge on a bar station that includes a sink, plus condiment trays, and an insulated ice bucket from Home Depot. Or, supplement your cook station with a modular side burner and sink combo from Master Forge. Wondering about a dishwasher? Demand is low so they are hard to find. Best to rinse dishes in that sink and cart the load to the house to finish inside.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: Lighting</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For comfort and aesthetics, outdoor lighting is a no-brainer. It’s also necessary for safety. As with the indoor kitchen, you want the prep and grill areas well-lit. Dining and seating areas can get by with softer, ambient lighting, but make sure pathways are lit so no one stumbles at night. Your contractor can help you determine the appropriate outdoor options for spotlights focused on task areas, as well as pendant, post, or string lighting to illuminate the dining and lounging areas, and lantern or path lighting for groundcover. Again, you want fixtures made to be operated outdoors, but look for LED versions. This option is preferable because LEDs give off little heat, can handle temperature swings from -40F to 180F, and last up to 10 years or for 100,000 hours of continuous use. You’ll find the widest range of selection at box stores where you can see the lights illuminated to help you decide if you like the effect.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Tip: Keep convenience within reach</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since your contractor is running lines for utilities, ask them to include electrical outlets for small appliances, like a blender, portable stereo, and space heaters. Your contractor will know the correct type of outdoor outlets, which should be ground fault circuit interpreter (GFCI).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cooking on the grill is a great American pastime, whether entertaining friends or feeding your family. Maximize your enjoyment by adding some sizzle to al fresco dining with a beautiful, super-functional outdoor kitchen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Emily moved to New York City last year, she went in search of an apartment with a warm, old-world feel. Although originally from California, she had recently spent two years living and studying in Normandy, France, where she developed an appreciation for beautiful prewar buildings that wore their age gracefully. Emily loved that the apartments she came across there—no matter how small or simple—always had ornamental features that elevated the space. Paneling, vintage doorknobs, and other small details contributed to an overall elegance, and she wanted the same for her new apartment in New York.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21355" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-21349"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A six month-long search resulted in the purchase of a 435-square-foot studio apartment in an understated 1940s building on the Upper West Side. It was a prewar apartment but also a condo, a rare combination that suited Emily’s criteria. Although it was a studio, it had distinctly separate spaces: an entryway, dressing area, kitchen, bath, and main living space, which Emily liked. Unfortunately, having been used as a longtime rental property, the apartment had been stripped of most of its original ornamentation. Instead, there was paint a dozen layers thick and worn flooring throughout the studio. In the narrow galley kitchen, there were sticky off-white cabinets, peeling vinyl floors, and almost no counter space at all. The very peachy-yellow bathroom sported tiles that didn’t match in spots where they had once been replaced, and a tank-less, industrial toilet gave the small space an unpleasantly institutional vibe. To the left of the front door, two shallow closets took up valuable floor space, which Emily felt would be better utilized as an office nook.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21368 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-02" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21367" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-01" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Emily envisioned a restoration of sorts: she wanted to add paneling and crown molding to the walls of the main living space, and to create a simple bath with a vintage black-and-white theme. The kitchen would be modern but befitting the age of the building. And although the discrete spaces of the apartment were a major selling point, Emily felt that the narrow kitchen would be much improved if it could be opened up to the main living area. Pinterest provided ample inspiration, and she set out to source the materials herself, relying heavily on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a> and other online stores.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having developed a concrete plan for the renovation, Emily and her dad, John, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> to Sweeten. John had had substantial experience with construction and renovation in the past, and with his input, Emily settled on a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. The crew quickly went to work realizing Emily’s vision, and also provided helpful suggestions and additions along the way. For example, unprompted, the contractor stripped a half-century of paint from the front door, revealing the beautiful metal patina underneath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on Emily’s direction, he created a pass-through from the galley kitchen to the living area, extending the counter through the opening to create a breakfast perch with stools. Open shelving made of marble and brass took the place of upper cabinets, creating more room to breathe in the narrow space. The appliances and sink were lined up on the left, given that the counters and base cabinets on the right were a mere nine inches deep. (The entire kitchen was just about six feet wide!) An under-counter refrigerator, paneled to blend in with the cabinets, preserved the new airiness of the space. Sadly, there was no room for a dishwasher, but a 24-inch gas range fit perfectly at the end of the counter. Finishes were consistent with those found in older buildings, featuring white subway tile, marble counters, brass detailing, charcoal gray lower cabinets, and blackened metal light fixtures with a retro feel. For the floor, Emily chose a fun Spanish tile in black and white.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21360 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21380 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08.gif" alt="" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21362 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-09" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21363 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-10" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21364" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the original dressing area, the floor space was expanded once the closets were removed. Custom shelving and a desk were cut to fit inside the nook perfectly, creating a cozy home office away from the main sleeping area. In the main room of the studio, her Sweeten contractor added small details that restored elegance to the apartment. Marble ledges on the windows, as well as wall paneling, crown molding, and new baseboards transformed the space in subtle but distinct ways. The bathroom received a similarly unpretentious and classic treatment: white subway tile with a beveled edge and black trim, matched to a matte black towel rack. To prevent an accidental burn and to disguise an unsightly floor-to-ceiling radiator pipe, he suggested that they wrap it with rope.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, unlike many of Sweeten’s renovating homeowners, Emily and John managed the project from afar—they were in California while her contractor and his team worked on her apartment. They arranged for check-ins via FaceTime or Skype, and he provided photos and updates on the work on a regular basis. Despite the 2,500 miles between them, there were remarkably few hiccups on this Sweeten project. Emily and John attributed this to good communication with the contractor and his team, but also to the fact that they went into the process with a firm plan, and sourced the materials for arrival prior to the start of the job. Emily’s advice to future renovators: “There is a lot that can go wrong when you’re renovating, but it helps to start with a good idea of what you want. And if you source the materials yourself, you can cut down on some of the variables that might delay the project.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks so much, Emily, and we hope you’re enjoying your lovely new-old studio!</p>
