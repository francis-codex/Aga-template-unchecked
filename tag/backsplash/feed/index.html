			<h2>Modern kitchen backsplash ideas with budget, maintenance, and functionality in mind</h2>
<h3><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14.jpg" alt="green subway backsplash tile in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-43493 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />How to get started on your modern kitchen backsplash ideas</h3>
<p class="p1">You’ve decided to renovate your cookspace. Where should you begin? There are plenty of factors to consider, from the scope of the project to how you want the backsplash to function. You&#8217;ll also decide on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professionals who will guide you</a> and handle the measuring and installation. Sweeten breaks down the elements, whether you&#8217;re considering budget ideas or feature walls.</p>
<p>It’s important to go into your project with a general idea of what your needs are. Is there a heavy emphasis on the budget? Do you want an extremely durable material or have ongoing maintenance concerns on your mind? Are you curious what goes into a more complex backsplash project? Once the budget, materials, and project scope are more clear, you can bring your modern kitchen backsplash ideas to life.</p>

<h3 class="p1">What is the budget for the backsplash material?</h3>
<p class="p1">Whether you’re looking to keep material costs low or don’t mind spending a little extra, here are a few options for each of these considerations.</p>
<h4>Ceramic tile kitchen backsplash</h4>
<p class="p1">Ceramic tile comes in a variety of shapes and colors, making it a good place to start your material search. On the lower end of the budget spectrum, you may want to consider a subway tile backsplash. Ceramic subway tile, known for being both affordable and classic, comes in around $3 a square foot. Classic doesn’t have to be boring, though. Consider arranging bright white tiles in a different pattern, such as herringbone, to change the aesthetic of the entire room.</p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg" alt="banquette kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44346" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners&#8217; <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/duplex-remodel-first-time-renovators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenn + Jon&#8217;s chevron pattern</a></p>
<h4>Porcelain tile kitchen backsplash</h4>
<p class="p1">A close second in the low-to-mid range budget area is porcelain tile. Coming in at around $3–$5 a square foot, porcelain is stain and water-resistant, but is very fragile during installation. Similar to ceramic, porcelain comes in a large variety of different sizes, colors, and shapes. If you decide on porcelain tile, be sure to hire a professional with experience in working with this delicate material.</p>
<h4>Brick kitchen backsplash</h4>
<p class="p1">In the mid-range cost per square foot, brick veneer can bring a warm and inviting feel to your kitchen. Coming in at around $9 a square foot, this material gives your kitchen a unique backdrop reminiscent of a cozy coffee shop.</p>
<h4>Marble tile kitchen backsplash</h4>
<p class="p1">If you have a larger budget, you could consider using a natural stone such as marble. Marble is a beautiful material to use for a kitchen backsplash, creating a more polished look and feel. This higher-end material will cost you somewhere between $25–$30 a square foot. Bear in mind that because marble slabs or tile and natural stone are generally more porous than other materials, this could mean more maintenance in the long run.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Most durable materials</h3>
<p class="p1">Metal tiles are a unique and durable option for a working kitchen. The surface is easily cleaned and resistant to most kitchen messes, like water and food splash-back. Metal may be a good option if you want something low-maintenance without sacrificing your sense of style.</p>
<p class="p1">If you love the look of natural stone, but worry about the durability, consider using granite. Granite is an extremely resistant natural stone often used in countertops but also works well as a stone backsplash material. It is easy to clean and only requires occasional maintenance such as re-sealing and polishing. It’s a great <span class="s1">durable</span> option for a natural stone look that you could even <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/popular-types-of-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordinate to match your countertops</a>.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Low-maintenance backsplash ideas</h3>
<p class="p1">In a kitchen with a lot of daily usage and traffic, consider a backsplash material that is resistant against things such as food stains, heat, or water. Glass tile is modern, easy to clean, and non-porous, and at around $7 a square foot, really affordable. The peel-and-stick variety is also very common, which generally means you can find it at a good price. Glass tile is low maintenance and does not require anything special to clean. It’s a great backsplash option for busy people who don’t have the time to do a lot of deep cleaning.</p>
<p class="p1">Another low-maintenance backsplash option is slabs of stone such as quartz. Stone slabs have fewer seams, and thus, less grout to keep clean. Quartz slabs are particularly popular because they give a marble-style aesthetic for less than the cost of actual marble. If quartz isn’t your thing, consider other slab backsplash options like soapstone or solid-surface.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are interested in a stone slab backsplash like quartz, expect to pay somewhere in the range of $65-$80 a square foot.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Tip:</strong> To cut down on expenses during a kitchen remodel, utilize leftover slab pieces from your countertop replacement for your backsplash.</p>
<h3>Modern kitchen backsplash ideas make a statement</h3>
<p class="p1">This vertical surface is the centerpiece of your kitchen; why not make it a feature wall? Consider a detailed ceramic-tile backsplash using one to two-inch tiles. The tiles are small enough to arrange in several different designs, and you can use alternating colors and shapes to create a piece of art right in your kitchen.</p>
<p class="p1">Natural stone can also be used to create a mosaic-style backsplash. Use different-sized pieces and combine them to fit naturally against each other.</p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="backsplash kitchen tile" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47119" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners&#8217; Nilda + Brian&#8217;s renovation</p>
<p class="p1">Adding a patterned tile or mosaic-style kitchen backsplash will increase your labor costs, so you should take into consideration an additional $17–$20 per square foot. More complex designs will cost more in labor due to the intricacies of laying the tile.<span class="s1"> </span>To save some money in labor costs, you could opt to create a small section of tile artistry. Consider a square cut-out with different colored tiles in the middle of your regular backsplash tiles.<span class="s1"> This could be placed in a focal-point area above your stove or sink, depending on the layout of your kitchen. </span>You could also decide to lay rectangular tiles in a linear style, which will typically cost less in installation because it is generally less time-consuming.</p>
<h3>Ordering the right quantity</h3>
<p class="p1">When purchasing the materials for a piece of intricate backsplash art, large or small, measurements become crucial. Have a design plan for the area in the form of a sketch or inspiration picture, and measure everything as accurately as possible. This can get complicated quickly, so it’s best to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">ask your general contractor</span></a> for guidance rather than undertaking an intensive project by yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">Kitchen backsplash material considerations take time and careful planning. Know what your budget is and what materials work best for your lifestyle. It is the first place to start towards your dream cook space.</p>

			<h2>These white subway tile kitchens showcase 5 fresh takes on a classic trend</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40333 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-09.jpg" alt="Image of a white subway tile kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-09-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p>Many homeowners choose classic white subway tiles to give their kitchens a polished finish. They&#8217;re a versatile design feature, with styles and textures found in multiple materials like marble, glass, and ceramic. They also have many uses, most frequently as statement pieces in backsplashes, or as a complete wall design. Ultimately, white subway tiles have become popular because they offer a minimalist look that matches all styles and sizes of kitchens.</p>
<p>Here, we&#8217;re sharing 6 Sweeten kitchen renovations that used white subway tiles in inspiring ways.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Cleverly-disguised kitchen cabinets</h3>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44867 mb-0 size-full" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-Apt-11.gif" alt="white subway tile kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></h3>
<p>When <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowners Tara and Brian </a>decided it was time to update their home, they knew they wanted a modern atmosphere. They were done with their dated oak cabinets and cluttered room design and were ready for a <a href="https://www.bhg.com/kitchen/styles/modern/minimalist-kitchen-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more minimalist, open layout</a>. To get there, they added a glossy white subway tile backsplash that extends through an entire wall. The subway tiles also double as doors to their hidden pantry, giving an otherwise incognito cabinet a sleek finish.</p>
<h3>A marble take on white subway tiles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23867 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14.gif" alt="marble subway tile kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/loft-apartment-inside-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner Romuald</a> renovated his Elmhurst home to achieve an open concept cook space. In the kitchen, he opened up the walls to get a direct sightline across the ground floor. Before, his kitchen was dark and closed off. Now, a marble subway tile kitchen backsplash brings a clean look to the room.</p>
<h3>A chevron-patterned subway tile enriches a kitchen</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovating-to-stay-in-a-beloved-neighborhood/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22790 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg" alt="chevron-patterned white subway tile kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 10 years of residency, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovating-to-stay-in-a-beloved-neighborhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim and Igor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were ready to upgrade their Carroll Gardens kitchen. Kim &#8220;knew from the get-go&#8221; that she wanted a white kitchen. So, the main focus of their renovation was reducing the dull and uninviting feel while bringing in </span><a href="https://www.homesandgardens.com/news/two-tone-kitchen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more dual-tone white &amp; gray pieces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They added chevron-patterned subway tiles that had the right textured element to give them the modern and vibrant look they dreamed of. </span></p>
<h3>Glass subway tiles energize a small kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25335 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="glass subway tile kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/56-square-feet-small-kitchen-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner Jill</a> wanted to renovate her 56-square-foot Yorkville kitchen after 20 years of use. Her goal was to update the design and personalize the small space to better suit her lifestyle. With help from her Sweeten contractor, Jill selected a subway tile for her backsplash in an elegant glass finish. This not only gave her kitchen an upscale, clean look but also visually expanded its small square footage.</p>
<h3>A white-tiled kitchen with a retro-industrial feel</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44329 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-03.jpg" alt="white subway tile kitchen " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan and Mike </a>were inspired by their building’s historical industrial architecture and decided to renovate their kitchen to achieve that same theme. In order to obtain this, they added classic white subway tiles that line the walls as a way to contrast the darker cabinets. This tiling <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/a-quick-fix-brightens-a-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brightened up the space </a>and softened the surrounding retro-industrial aesthetic.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</strong></b>: Revamp an outdated kitchen in Kensington, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Racquel scored a deal when she found her 800-square-foot co-op in an estate sale, though she knew the kitchen (that hadn’t been updated since the ‘60s) would need work. “The first thing I did when I put my offer in was ask people how to get the kitchen done. It looked like it belonged in a museum. I kept staring at the stove—I could not believe it,” she said. Her renovation journey, however, got off to a rocky start. After a year of work with a kitchen designer she found through an ad on Facebook, walkthroughs without results, a quick purchase of a too-big fridge, and poor communication overall, Racquel had enough and took a year off from the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36159 mb-0 size-chrono" title="racquel-standing-in-her-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="racquel standing in her kitchen near window after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once she felt ready to take it on again, a friend, who was <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23924" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating her house</a> with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> and had joined <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/referral/friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their referral program</a>, suggested Racquel give them a try. “My friend said, ‘I’ve already started with Sweeten and they’re great.’ I was done trying to find people on my own that I couldn&#8217;t properly vet. I needed people who knew the business,” Racquel explained. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5865" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project </a>with the goal of bringing the old-fashioned space to the 21st century while maintaining a feeling of playfulness and joy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Once she was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377">this general contractor</a>, work began. Some debate about the stove ensued, but ultimately she decided to replace it. After living with it for over two years, “I had a Stockholm Syndrome relationship with my stove,” she said. While her initial thought was to incorporate quirky touches in the main elements of the kitchen, like using butcher block for the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countertops</a>, she decided to stick with modern, easy-to-clean materials, and incorporate more of her personality through accessories and paint. The white glossy cabinets with simple matte black hardware achieved that sleek look while offering a neutral backdrop for a creamy yellow wall and colorful knick-knacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The elevator broke down, which caused some minor hiccups. The stove, which was set to be delivered, had to be delayed and was then lost. Despite the holdup, Racquel’s renovation was completed within the three-week time period the general contractor had quoted from the beginning. “He worked around the issues without batting an eyelash,” she said. He even joined her on a trip to IKEA, waited for the cabinets, and brought them to her home the next morning. “He told me every day what was going to happen that day, and that’s exactly what happened,” she continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36155 mb-24 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-and-herringbone-backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with black handles and off-white countertop and yellow walls and herringbone backsplash and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-cabinets-and-yellow-walls"  class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-36151" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with white countertop and yellow wall and undermount stainless steel sink with brushed nickel pull down faucet and herringbone backsplash after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/first-time-renovators-share-their-stories-vol-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-time renovator</a>, Racquel shared this advice: “Resist the urge to rip things out before you have a chance to live with it. If I hadn’t, I don’t think I would’ve made the best decisions,” she said. Her patience certainly paid off. “Sometimes I walk into the kitchen with the sun coming in and it feels like a postcard. It looks like a magazine,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The cabinets were still a little difficult for Racquel to reach, so the contractor also left a space for her ladder between the fridge and the wall, so she’d have easy access to it when she needed to reach higher shelves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>This eye-catching design is having a moment</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its familiar broken zigzag is something you’ve probably seen before in a tweed suit or jacket, calling to mind the likes of Sherlock Holmes and Chanel. From fashion to home design, this elegant pattern—expressed in a range of materials—makes a big impact. Below, eight homeowners make herringbone their own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26030 size-chrono" title="herringbone floors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-723x482.jpg" alt="herringbone" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_foyer-e1502742377528.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26296 mb-0 size-chrono" title="herringbone floors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_foyer-723x461.jpg" alt="herringbone" width="723" height="461" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A peek of oak herringbone underneath old carpeting inspired <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/prewar-apartment-estate-sale-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kasey</a> to restore the original floors in his prewar apartment. During his renovation, he discovered that the floors were in near perfect condition. A light <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/repair-protect-wood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">touch-up</a> was all that was needed to return them to their former glory.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25564 mb-0 size-chrono" title="herringbone floors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43-723x1085.jpg" alt="herringbone" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry</a> splurged on herringbone <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walnut floors</a> in the kitchen and downstairs parlor, which quickly became one of their favorite features in the townhouse. The pattern, combined with the warmth of the stain, adds plenty of interest and texture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30403 size-chrono" title="herringbone floors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-new-2-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>Looking for something more durable than wood, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allison and Jovito</a> chose a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">porcelain tile</a> with imitation grain to give the appearance of polished white oak. Their contractor laid the tile in a herringbone pattern to punch up the muted tones of the kitchen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30397 size-chrono" title="herringbone backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-new-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wanting some &#8220;wow&#8221; in the kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alicia and Ed</a> decided that subway tile was firmly off limits. Instead, the couple chose cream-colored marble laid in a herringbone pattern for a touch of warmth.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30398 size-chrono" title="herringbone backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-03-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To inject some color into his all-white kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/home-improves-view-inside/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gall</a> chose a gold-toned herringbone backsplash comprised of glass and marble tile. The combination of different materials and colors provides a refreshing update on a classic design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24172 mb-0 size-chrono" title="herringbone tile floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-723x1083.jpg" alt="herringbone" width="723" height="1083" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-723x1083.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>Inspired by the clean, elegant look of hotel bathrooms, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/food-writer-uses-hotel-inspired-style-art-deco-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren and Ross</a> covered every inch of their master bath in marble. For the floor, they chose a white herringbone tile and paired it with fine lines of gray grout for some subtle contrast.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27183 mb-0 size-chrono" title="herringbone tile floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-19-723x1085.jpg" alt="herringbone" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/general-contractors-dream-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ana and Leo</a> amped up the drama in their modern guest bathroom with herringbone mosaic <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tile</a> in shades of gray. The addition is the perfect complement to the minimal design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24332 mb-0 size-chrono" title="herringbone tile in the shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg" alt="herringbone" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an all-white theme in mind, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cecilia and Jonathan</a> wanted to keep things bright and shiny in their full bath. A slight deviation from the plan inspired an accent wall of veined marble subway tile laid in a herringbone pattern.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">A loft apartment rediscovers its historic roots by exposing its beams, maximizing 11-foot ceilings, and bringing the walls down</span></h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Meg and Brett had grown comfortable with their rental—despite its tiny shower, inadequate climate control, and chronic water problems—but dreamed of something to call their own. Having searched for years without success, they finally landed on just the thing: a spacious loft apartment in Hamilton Heights with a history. They went to work restoring some of the industrial charm that previous owners had plastered over with drywall, and the result is a stunning combination of original wooden beams, salvage finds, and touches of warmth that make an apartment a home. Read on for Brett’s take on how he worked with Sweeten to create the ideal space for his growing family.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24990 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Hamilton Heights homeowner Brett</span></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had been renting in NYC in different neighborhoods for many years, including most recently, our rental of eight years at the corner of 63rd Street and 2nd Ave. We loved our rental, but it had its share of problems&#8230;it would heat up like an oven in the summer, and in winter, it was so cold we could see our breath in the living room. It flooded every other year, and we could hear honking almost 24/7. It was imperfect but it was comfortable, and we loved it. We thought about purchasing a place for many years, but every apartment we looked at was a step down from where we were. Then we found it…the perfect place in the perfect neighborhood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">&#8230;after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment! </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment we found was an 1,800-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath condo loft in the historic district of Hamilton Heights. In an old carriage house that had been converted to residential lofts, the building was one of the few remaining carriage houses left in the city. We can track its existence back to 1903 from old ads in the Tammany Times, but I am sure it was built before then.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The place had been renovated not too long ago and was finished nicely. It had everything we ever wanted, and had we moved in as is, it would have been a huge step up from our current place. Most people would have moved in and not changed a thing. Our friends, our parents, and our brokers all thought we were crazy to even touch it. But after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as our vision was concerned, we wanted our loft apartment to feel high-end, but not stuffy or fancy. It should have a modern and clean feel to it, while still being classic and forever. We wanted to feel like we were on vacation when we were at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This place had a lot of history and interest to it, but we felt that the previous owner covered up a lot of the historical aspects, and aimed to expose them literally and figuratively. We describe it as smashing-a-modern-apartment-into-a-barn because that is kind of what we did. Attention wasn&#8217;t paid to trends, design rules, or motifs. We picked what we liked, and things that would be forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love watching &#8220;<a href="https://youtu.be/t221YNSCFLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open House&#8221; NYC</a>, our normal weekend activity, and saw an ad for Sweeten come on. Knowing that work needed to be done on the place, we thought of this as a good sign and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/8578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed up on the site</a>. Looking through their bios and past work, we found a few contractors who we were matched with that we liked. After speaking to three on the phone, there was a good feeling with one Sweeten design/build firm. His pictures showed he could do nice work, and he seemed like a straight shooter. We met with him at his office and got a quote on the scope of work. My wife and I liked the Sweeten contractor and felt him to be honest. We never got another quote or met with another contractor. His price wasn’t cheap but I didn’t want cheap work. I wanted someone I knew would do the job right.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I discovered during this renovation that developers will often square things off and use preset sizes for things to make the job easier and cheaper. After we did some demo, we found a ton of extra storage space just behind the sheetrock in the kitchen—and built an 8-foot-tall <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry</a> into the wall to the left of the fridge. Don’t be afraid to knock a few holes in walls. It’s all going to be painted anyway. After all, ours ended up being floor-to-ceiling in the kitchen which rivals most suburban pantries. Lastly, we recessed all the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a> except pendants over the peninsula, which we replaced with classic handblown Simon Pierce light fixtures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the exposed brick in the living room—which had 11-foot-high ceilings—and looked to continue the theme. We walked around and knocked on the drywall—if it felt hollow, we put a hole through to see what was underneath. This method allowed us to find original beams and columns all over the apartment and expose them. The wooden beams were original to the carriage house, whereas the iron beams were installed to support the original structure at some point in the building’s history. Some of the beams had initials in them, and we even found a horsehair or two caught in the wood!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wood-burning fireplace was originally wrapped in an ugly stone, so we wrapped it in black steel and replaced the mantle with a natural soapstone. Behind the fireplace, we built a niche for all the electronics and hung a TV above the mantel. We stripped the yellow varnish off the wide-plank oak <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a> throughout the loft apartment and refinished them with an eco-friendly, non-toxic, two-stage fuming process. The ceiling was painted the color of the sky—Benjamin Moore Grey Sky—and recessed LED lighting was added. A large custom table was built for the space by RE-CO Brooklyn from a single tree that fell during Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I found the tall ladder in the boiler room of an old factory in the Bronx. I work for a company that owns a few buildings in Hunts Point, and there are generations of industries and companies that have come and gone in those buildings. In my downtime, I like to explore the old abandoned spaces. Sometimes you can find the coolest stuff if you aren’t afraid to get a little dirty. The ladder was blackened from the fumes and probably at least 40 years old. I sanded it down and now use it to reach for items and to add some vertical interest. For the plant hangers, I used various industrial parts I found at a supply store to create a way to attach and hang plants to the beam.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, we went for a classic look: white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> with Carrara marble countertops and backsplash, with pulls and knobs in silver. The original kitchen cabinets had a shiny yellow wood finish that was not our style, so they were stripped down and painted in a nice white. Various sections were distressed to better fit the style of the loft apartment. The counters and backsplash are 3.5-inch-thick Carrara marble—the distributor said it was too hard to deliver and install such a thick piece in one slab because of the weight. But we insisted and they had to use 10 men to bring it in and install it! We also enlarged the sink with a Kohler stainless steel model. The range is a Bertazzoni Pro. Next to the sink is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mini-fridge</a> that is stocked with the same items you would find in a hotel mini-fridge—even things I don’t like!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, in the master bath, we went with a large 4-inch <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hex tile</a> in Carrara marble, with a simple white subway tile on the walls to match. I found our sink at an old steel warehouse in the South Bronx—it was filled with debris and pigeon poop at the time but was in surprisingly good shape. It’s a 48-inch Kohler slop sink circa 1948, and our Sweeten contractor was able to create a custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> underneath to fit the unusual shape of the sink. Our contractor also custom-made the mirror above to match.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the kitchen, we found space behind walls in the bathroom and created three linen closets. This room also holds the thing that I’m most excited about in the whole renovation: the shower. It’s spacious and comfortable—I had to duck down to get into our old shower and I’m only 5’8” on a good day. My wife’s favorite thing about the entire renovation is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer/dryer</a>! I didn’t even have to ask what it was…at our old building, the washing machines looked so old, I swear they ran on steam power. Clothes would come out dirtier than when they went in.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom, we redid the floor-to-ceiling closets with custom wooden doors and hid a TV inside. We also added custom wood shutters to the windows, which accentuate the unique shape of the windows. They are super deep, tall and arched. Without many good options, we concluded this was the best way to address the arch without ruining the architectural interest of the windows. As for the rest of the bedroom, it feels very serene and relaxing. Sleep is important to my wife and me, and we wanted it to feel like a retreat from the city. We didn&#8217;t want any industrial elements in here. We wanted it to feel refined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the entire process, our Sweeten contractor stayed on budget, which was very important to us. He completed the project within the time frame we discussed, even though I kept adding more and more work. He was pleasant to work with and fixed every concern or problem I brought up. Even after the project was complete, he repeatedly checked in and fixed a problem or two that was missed during the renovation. Now that we’re done, I’d say that the hardest part was staying on budget with a project of this scope. We kept finding more things that we wanted to do. My advice to future renovators is to anticipate this and to make a list of things that need to be perfect. Don’t be afraid to move backwards or sideways. Better to take your time, and get what you want than rush and end up with something subpar.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Romuald had a dream: he wanted to live in a loft apartment. His current home, a 1,800-square-foot house in Elmhurst, was definitely <em>not</em> a loft, but it was ideal for him and his wife in many other ways. It was close to both of their jobs, as well as to both sets of parents, and they loved having a backyard right off the kitchen. So they decided to do the next best thing: make their home as &#8220;loft-like&#8221; as a house could be, most notably opening </span><span class="s1">up walls so the space would have an airy feel. Finally, it came time to tackle the tight, closed-off kitchen. Here are the details on a long-awaited kitchen renovation (and a few extras!) befitting two avid cooks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23870 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-Before-01-723x482.jpg" alt="loft apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23862 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="loft apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23860 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-01" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23865" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-09-10" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">After living in his home for close to ten years, Romuald knew that a new kitchen could dramatically change how his family used the space. He and his wife love cooking together, so they wanted to create a new kitchen in which two (or more!) people could comfortably work. Upon his wife&#8217;s recommendation, he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">turned to Sweeten</span></a> for help and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his <span class="s2">contractor</span></a> for the project. The original kitchen featured dark wood cabinets and felt cave-like because of a wall separating it from the main living space. Wanting to demolish the wall, it was necessary to regain the storage space by adding an island. It also afforded an extra work surface and an unobstructed sightline across the whole first floor of the house for a loft apartment feel. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Working with their contractor, the couple came up with a plan for their new kitchen. The original flooring was a tile that contrasted with the hardwood running through the rest of the first floor. They wanted to continue the wood look but opted for a gray “wood” porcelain that would be much easier to maintain (important for a kitchen that sees a lot of action!). <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semi-custom cabinets</a> made it possible for creative storage solutions like an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221; (details below) to be incorporated into the kitchen plan. The warm gray cabinets they chose from <a href="https://www.waypointlivingspaces.com/cabinets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Waypoint</span></a> coordinated with the new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a>. A white quartz countertop and classic marble subway tile for the backsplash brought a clean yet contrasting look. Above the stove, they installed a pot-filler to save the job of hauling a heavy pot of water from the sink on the island to the stovetop.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-11-12.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23866 mb-0 size-chrono" title="microwave" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-11-12.gif" alt="microwave" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Romuald and his wife started shopping around to replace all of their appliances with the exception of their investment appliance—a <a href="https://www.thermador.com/us/products/ranges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Thermador</span></a> range with blue knobs. After visiting appliance stores and making product choices,  he came across one of his favorite finds—the microwave drawer! A built-in microwave was placed high on their wish list so that it wouldn’t take up valuable counter space like their previous one did. When he came across the drawer, he knew that it was the way to go. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Next, their Sweeten contractor suggested the genius solution of an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221;—a much-loved-but-seldom-seen feature in city apartments. This storage unit would house their toaster, coffeemaker, as well as a few odds and ends, with outlets built into the back keeping a tangle of cords contained. With the “garage door” lowered, the counters would look instantly cleaner.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">In the spot where a dividing wall originally stood, they installed an island. While they had intended to build one about six feet long, it ultimately expanded to a 10-foot-long island—a decision that Romuald doesn’t regret one bit. “We can fit four stools along one side, while the other side has enough space for our farmhouse sink, microwave drawer, and dishwasher—and with storage room, too!” Given the space now has the open feel of a loft apartment, they can now watch the TV in their living room from the kitchen. Romuald explains, “We have it on a swivel, so we just swing it around and can cook and watch TV at the same time. This is great for unwinding after a long day’s work.” They also love the way that the breeze flows through the entire space when they open the door to the backyard—something that wasn’t possible with walls in the way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23861 mb-24 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">While the project took a bit longer than anticipated due to delays in delivery of materials, Romuald reports that they are very happy with the way it all turned out. And although they had intended on just renovating the kitchen, the project expanded in the end to include new floors throughout the entire living space, as well as a new railing for the stairs leading to the second floor of their house. All of these changes have made their house a dream home for the couple!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you, Romuald for sharing your new, loft-like space with us!</i></span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>A hunt for more space led Tina Ladd and her husband, Fletcher, from a one-bedroom on Manhattan’s Upper West Side to a garden duplex in a Cobble Hill brownstone. As an architect, Tina was thrilled to be able to customize their new home but was up against an urgent deadline: the imminent birth of the couple’s first child. The transformation was so remarkable, we&#8217;re telling the story in two parts, starting with the parlor. </i></span><span class="s1"><i>Here’s part one of Tina’s vision for the family home—and how she went into labor on moving day! </i></span></p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Guest post by Tina in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Coming from a one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side, we were eager to upsize to a two-bedroom and create a home for our expanding family. We had been looking at listings up and down Manhattan and in a couple of Brooklyn neighborhoods before we found out we were expecting a baby. Four months into the pregnancy (and into intensifying nesting instincts), we went into contract on a duplex in a historic Brooklyn townhouse. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">While we would have been happy with a turn-key apartment, we were both open to renovation work so I could exercise my skill set as an architect and design a more tailored home for our family. With the advantage of a network of design professionals and general construction knowledge, we knew we could take on an appropriately sized project. As we approached a fixed deadline—the due date—we eliminated any options that would require significant structural, electrical, or plumbing work. This would not only cut down on a construction timeline, but it would also eliminate the lengthy review process of obtaining permits from the Department of Buildings and the Landmark Preservation Commission.</span></p>

<p class="p5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s2">As an architect, I didn’t want a cookie-cutter apartment; luckily, my husband, Fletcher, was supportive in my pursuit of something unique. </span>When we attended the open house for our apartment, we were drawn to the high ceilings and 10-foot windows framing the living room. The sun-filled living space was located on the entry parlor level of the townhouse (about five feet above street level), with views directly out to the beautiful brownstone street. The bedrooms were located on the garden level, one floor below. While the 1,200 sq. ft, two-bedroom space checked many boxes on our list, we felt a few changes were needed to turn it into the home we were searching for. The living space was in good shape, and some of it was even recently renovated. However, the kitchen was small and closed-off. Unlike the parlor floor with tall ceilings, the lower, garden level had very low ceilings and felt like a basement. <span class="s2">The previous owners had added some modern touches, and while we both prefer the minimalist aesthetic in certain types of projects, we knew bringing back some familiar character would help make the historic apartment feel more inviting.</span></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Due to the seller’s terms for a closing date, we were in contract for nearly three months, pushing a tighter deadline. In order to be sure we could hit the ground running with construction upon closing, we discussed major design decisions, and I completed drawings for our anticipated work before meeting with contractors, and ahead of our closing date. At first, we had planned to open the kitchen and re-tile the bathrooms. By the time we were meeting with contractors, our list expanded to include refinishing the floors, adding molding/casing, and replacing all the interior doors. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I <span class="s3"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned to Sweeten</a></span> to find a contractor after seeing an ad during Open House NYC, my favorite Sunday morning TV show. We were matched with three general contractors and decided to move forward with the <span class="s3"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> who best understood our vision and could</span> help us strategically meet our goals. He laid out a six-week timeline—a more ambitious schedule than we had anticipated! To meet our budget, we chose to supply the materials and fixtures, taking advantage of my design industry discounts.</span></p>

<p class="p6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Our first goal with the apartment was to create an open </span><span class="s4">kitchen</span><span class="s1">. The existing kitchen was separated from the living room by a floating, non-structural wall. By removing the wall and turning the corner with new cabinets, we could transform the space from a narrow galley-style kitchen to an open L- shape with an island.</span></p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">From the first time we saw the space, I envisioned a transitional-style kitchen with navy blue <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a>. I considered both Ikea cabinets with custom fronts, as well as standard semi-custom options. In my first walk-through with the contractor, he suggested a custom cabinet maker that could execute my vision in a more cost-effective way than semi-custom options from a big-box store. Initially, custom cabinets were not in our budget. We were able to construct a kitchen perfectly fit for the space, maximizing storage vertically. We ended up choosing a shaker-style in Newburyport Blue. Simple, budget-friendly 2&#215;8 subway tile in white from Nemo Tile and white Frosty Carrina from Caesarstone allowed the color of the cabinets to really pop. We installed under-cabinet outlet strips and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a>, which added a level of sophistication.</span></p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The previous owners had installed top-of-the-line appliances—a Sub-Zero refrigerator, Miele dishwasher, Wolf range, and stove. Because we chose to keep the appliances, we designed around them. This was one advantage of a totally custom kitchen. We wanted a true <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exhaust hood</a> for the Wolf range with higher CFM (cubic feet per minute &#8211; a measure of the volume of air that moves heat, odor, moisture, and smoke per minute while cooking) capabilities than a typical over-the-range microwave venting system. The kitchen design didn’t really allow for an alternate microwave location, so we concealed it behind pocket doors in the island. The Sub-Zero refrigerator also impacted our design. The refrigerator door opened away from the cook and prep space in our new layout. Since the Sub-Zero design does not accommodate switching the door hinge side, the island footprint was rotated and narrowed from what we had originally planned in order to provide comfortable clearance.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing powder room design was very modern. To bring a more transitional feel marrying both traditional and contemporary elements into the bath, we replaced the tile, vanity mirrors and light fixtures for a more classic aesthetic. For the flooring, we chose Nemo’s Fluid basketweave marble mosaic; I love this pattern that was so common in prewar homes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, we got to work on the master bath and bedrooms which are located in the semi-subterranean lower level—and with shorter ceilings. Making the space brighter and restoring historic charm was the goal.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reorganize an awkward space</a> in this kitchen renovation</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: </span><span class="s1">Meredith and Jason’s apartment building in Chelsea was comprised of four townhouses that had been combined. The result was a kitchen with plenty of issues: Dark mahogany cabinets obscured the only window, blocking precious natural light. The kitchen island in a too-small space meant you could only walk around it if you brushed yourself up against a wall. A slightly raised floor made for regular toe-stubbing if you weren’t paying attention. A kitchen renovation was definitely in order.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: </span><span class="s1">The couple took some time getting an idea of what they wanted. Meredith took ownership of the aesthetics and Jason, the family cook, focused on creating a functional space. Despite the awkward island, Meredith still liked the idea of having one. After wrestling with the design, their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Sweeten contractor</span></a> suggested a wide peninsula. &#8220;As soon as I saw the drawing, I was on board with it,” said Meredith. This helped double the counter space and gives her a place to sit and work while Jason prepares dinner. The new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wood floor</a> was lowered an inch, eliminating the risk to toes, and now matches the rest of the apartment, making the kitchen feel “bigger, brighter and cleaner,” she said. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom cabinetry</a> freed the window for maximum natural light. The microwave was placed under the peninsula rather than above the range so Jason could install his dream <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hood</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: </span><span class="s1">The ceiling dropped about a foot in the old kitchen and a previous contractor said it could not be lifted. When their Sweeten contractor came in and found a way to lift it about seven inches, it was a big relief for the couple.   </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b></b>Here’s how to keep key materials—from countertops to appliances—performing at tip top</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">As your <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/">home renovation</a> draws to a close, you may experience feelings of relief and joy at the transformation from the old to the new. Decisions on materials turned out to be good choices, and daily life is now blending and flowing around your new space. Aftercare may be the last thing on your mind, or you may find yourself wondering: &#8220;How do I keep my newly renovated space looking great for years to come?&#8221;. Here are five ways to care for your new home.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="Range with white tile backsplash and open shelving" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56349" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/126635-Abby-Kitchen-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Consult manufacturers’ manuals for appliance care</strong></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">An obvious first renovation aftercare step that many homeowners skip. Most appliance manufacturers have a place on their webpage dedicated to manuals or product service and support. A model number will lead you to literature on cleaning and maintenance. Often, a simple Google search is enough. For example, a stainless wine refrigerator requires little attention except for periodically washing off fingerprints. This can be done with water and mild dish soap, then polished with a microfiber cloth dipped in mineral, cooking or olive oil. Note: Clean and polish with the grain. Look closely! Steel has grain just like wood. Here are extra tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://amzn.to/44JR5ag">Weiman Stainless Steel Wipes or Liquid Spray</a> work great</li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Register major appliances with the manufacturer through their website.</li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Make sure you know the model numbers for future reference &#8212; often they are on the back of the machine so take a picture or write it down for future reference.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speak with your contractor about how to maintain your equipment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Candid shot of Lia in her kitchen renovated with Sweeten" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56288" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Safeguard your kitchen countertops</strong></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">You probably reviewed pros and cons of different materials before you made your final decision of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/popular-types-of-kitchen-countertops/">kitchen countertops</a>. Ready to start cooking? Here’s a refresh!</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><strong>Quartz countertops</strong>, such as <a href="https://www.caesarstoneus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caesarstone</a>, are durable, non-porous and do not need to be annually resealed, but acidic foods or juices can erode the acrylic. This material is also more likely to be damaged by excessive heat than granite, crushed glass or concrete. Treat yourself to trivets.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Porous natural stones</strong>, such as granite and marble, may need to be resealed periodically and are susceptible to stains from oils and acids. Don’t let spilled liquids sit on your stone countertops. Spill? Swipe! Accidents happen &#8212; <a href="https://amzn.to/44LtExe">this etch remover</a> can be a lifesaver</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Laminate or solid-surfacing countertops</strong>, in this case, renovation aftercare means cutting boards are mandatory because both of these materials are easily scratched.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09.webp" alt="Shower with green and white patterned tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57255" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Tend to your tiles</strong></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-popular-bath-tiles-and-how-much-they-cost/">Bathroom tiles</a> get hazy with soapy residue, while kitchen backsplashes get splattered with oil, and floor tiles experience both! Regular cleaning will prevent the need to muscle through buildup, so break out a mild all-purpose cleaner and some basic cleaning equipment.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">For kitchen backsplash tiles, mix dish liquid with water and rub away the oily residue with a sponge or gentle cloth. White vinegar mixed with warm water is another option. A mild all-purpose cleaner will clean up bath tiles nicely. Mix the solution with water and wipe with a rag, a soft brush or sponge.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Sweep or vacuum floor tiles of any debris and grit on a regular basis to avoid dulling or scratching the surface. After clearing away large particles, use a mop and bucket with mild soap or detergent and warm water. If you wind up with a hazy film, consider switching up your mop material (sponge to chamois, for example) and/or wipe away the film with a fresh cloth and an all-purpose cleaner.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Seal your grout! Where there is tile, there is grout. <a href="https://amzn.to/3EusDPF">Use a sealant like this one</a>. For renovation aftercare for your grout, use gentle brushes to scrub it clean. And if your regular tile cleaning routine is not doing the trick on your grout, try a paste of baking soda and water, a mild bleach solution or store-bought grout cleaner. Remember to reseal grout periodically.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>4. Work with your wood</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Refinished or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brand new hardwoods</a> can be beautiful foundations for your home. If you are the type of family that takes off your shoes before entering the home, you are off to a great start! Even if not, caring for your floors can be easy with a few simple guidelines.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Begin your flooring renovation aftercare by placing indoor and outdoor welcome mats. Mats placed before and after the threshold of your door are an important first step in maintaining scratch- and stain-free floors even in the winter.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Area rugs cut down on regular wear and tear on the floors in the areas where they are positioned.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Little felt stickers (<a href="https://amzn.to/3Z7SqXp">like these</a>) do a good job protecting your floors from furniture-driven scratches.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are a few rules of thumb when cleaning your floors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sweep or vacuum debris on a regular basis</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Mop with water and a gentle soap and never leave water or other liquids sitting on your hardwoods. Water can eventually penetrate the finish and leave stains in the wood. If you are not sure what cleaner to use on your floors, manufacturers of wood sealants often offer hardwood floor cleaners, such as <a href="https://amzn.to/3RcK4vs">Minwax® Hardwood Floor Cleaner</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Laura-pantry-09-scaled.gif" alt="Moving image off renovator in custom cabinets" width="1706" height="2560" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57343" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Care for your cabinets</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although you likely will not be cleaning your kitchen or bathroom cabinets as often as higher-traffic surfaces (such as shower tiles and cooking countertops), don’t forget about them!  </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Knobs and pulls can harbor germs and cabinet doors can become grimy over time from moisture and oils in the air. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Similarly to hardwood floors, wooden cabinets don’t do well with water or other liquids resting on their surface.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1">Whether you clean your cabinets with soapy water, white vinegar water or mild all-purpose cleaner, remember these vital last steps: wipe away cleaner residue with a wet cloth and dry your cabinets with a towel.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Make a Brooklyn kitchen feel inviting</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Snug like a ship, a galley kitchen will maximize function in the smallest of spaces. Renovating an efficient galley layout can be as simple as upgrading appliances, lighting, and architectural details.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The room was earth-toned and hardly the apartment owner’s style. Its dated ceramic floor tile was a drab-looking tan and had been laid with wide grout joints that collected dirt. An uninspired backsplash with ugly, inexpensive accent tiles came down onto a counter that looked like mud-speckled granite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: The owners love cooking and entertaining, so they worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3250" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten contractor</a> to remodel not just for function but also to make the kitchen more welcoming. Walls have been brightened with white paint, as has the old radiator cover beneath the window. New white cabinets are taller than the former ones, and a small soffit conceals the leftover space above, simplifying the lines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crisp white subway tile updates the backsplash, and floor tiles were replaced with resilient material. Under-cabinet lighting supplements new halogen track lighting in the center of the ceiling. The stainless steel stove has a stainless combination hood-and-microwave above, and the new dishwasher is a pleasant addition. Cabinets now surround an efficient stainless french-door fridge; its freezer drawer conserves the cool air that otherwise would be lost when you open the door of a side-by-side model.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a bonus, creative space planning allowed the owners to repurpose an adjacent windowed alcove as a second bedroom.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kitchen expansion</a> in a studio apartment in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Giovanni, a Brooklyn-based doctor was looking to trade in his modern high-rise lifestyle for something with more history. This new studio, in a historic townhouse, offered original wood floors and the promise of exposing structural bricks beneath the plaster. The very basic and uninspired kitchen, however, was a distinct liability. Shoved into a shallow alcove, it had entry-level appliances and only a few inexpensive cabinets.<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Giovanni’s co-op approved his renovation proposal to combine a small closet and the alcove into an open plan for both cooking and laundry, so he turned to Sweeten for his project. His <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> helped shape the vision, and was “very good at telling me what was feasible.” Giovanni says. Breaking the plaster surface off structural brick walls proved an inexpensive way to add texture to the plain-vanilla apartment. Enlarging the kitchen footprint slightly, he added an eat-in peninsula to hide the washer-dryer while keeping pipes in roughly the same position. The backsplash is clad with matte gray subway tiles. To keep costs down, black-painted butcher block countertops offer a warmer temperature than stone. Overhead, a dropped ceiling provided space for new electrical wiring, for the high-tech pendants over the breakfast bar and for recessed lighting.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Glossy white cabinets look lush, and using stainless trim above lifts the dropped ceiling by helping it appear to float.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: <a href="https://www.geappliances.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE</a> appliances, <a href="https://www.lg.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG</a> compact combo washer-dryer, <a href="https://www.build.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kichler</a> pendant lighting from Build.com, matte-grey subway tiles for the backsplash.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tile revamps ho-hum walls and floors in an instant—from tile flooring to backsplash tile.</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are, your home has tiles somewhere—the bathroom and kitchen, or maybe a foyer or mudroom. While they serve a practical purpose—waterproof, easy to clean, protects surfaces—tiles have now emerged as a pivotal element in taking a space from flat to fabulous! Look to tile as a style and even a fashion choice, as manufacturing advances such as high-definition (HD) printing and slip-resistant finishes help to create a personal statement on floors, as well as walls. Consider these five trends:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Faux effects</h3>
<p>Improvements in HD printing have translated to tile with highly realistic interpretations of natural materials like wood and stone, as well as concrete, plaster, and metal. And the options don’t stop there. In addition to the oak or walnut look, these woods are coupled with different finishes and treatments—pickled, distressed, reclaimed (with the faux paint still intact), sustainable alternatives to exotic hardwoods like a mirror-polished cherry or mahogany that you might previously have found only in a palace or a yacht. This tile also lets you take “wood” where you previously might not have&#8230;inside a shower, for instance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for stone, you can install a luxurious-looking faux marble for your entire bath at a tenth the cost of the real thing, and without the habitual upkeep, such as sealing. No need to worry about scratches or water or wine stains with glazed porcelain. Why not combine a faux-wood and a faux-stone look in a bath? Most tile comes 3/8-inch thick, so it’s easier to combine these looks in tile than to align the differing heights of real wood planks with marble slabs on a floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a more industrial look for, say, a loft or home office, check out faux concrete in a super-size, like 24” x 24”—again, without the need to seal and with no risk of cracking, like poured concrete. If you crave color but don’t want those glossy 4” x 4” squares you remember from the school washroom, look for porcelain tiles that mimic encaustic cement tiles, with their luscious hues and patterns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Add various textures</h3>
<p>As described above, faux effects are achieved from highly realistic HD printing. Textures are also now being incorporated during the manufacturing process. Some faux weathered wood porcelain tile includes the dings and saw marks you’d expect to find in reclaimed planks, minus the splinters!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brick is making a comeback too, and with the introduction of faux brick tile comes a realistic pebbled surface. Consider paving your entryway with this tactile material—a perfect crossover from the outside in. Colored glazes in myriad choices give this brick fresh, contemporary appeal, and can provide a touch of texture to a space where a neutral color dominates like a shower or backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also expect to find tile with finishes that resemble fabric, from nubby linen to lace to fine twill. These styles look especially warm underfoot, and bring sophisticated depth when used on walls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Consider three-dimensional</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, 3D tile was very popular in those cool mid-century houses that were never renovated. If it was ever on your wishlist, you likely had to pay a lot for something that was hand cast or, alternatively, rough around the edges (literally). However, the demand for 3D has risen among designers for hotels and restaurants, and homeowners are now reaping the results. Manufacturers offer lots of interesting sculptural surfaces, from shallow recesses that resemble waves or indentations worn into stone by water to alternating raised and recessed hexagons to abstract and organic shapes that seem to spring from their surfaces. These tiles are good for feature walls and vertical areas, such as hallways that transition from one room to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Beyond basic shapes and patterns</h3>
<p>The hexagon is one of the more popular shapes to appear in kitchens and baths; it combines graphic interest with a classic outline, providing a strong motif around which you can play with size and color. One manufacturer created a wall tile with alternating rising and recessed discs. The 3” x 6” subway tile is seeing a renaissance, and reinterpreted in a thinner and longer dimension like 2” x 10” or even 2” x 20”. The rectilinear shapes lend themselves to a lot of different patterns when installed, like herringbone, chevron, and the running bond as an alternative to the traditional stacked. If you’re in the market for something more sensual, consider an arabesque-shape tile. Smaller versions will work on the floor, where the grout lines prevent slipping; it also makes a pretty backsplash or wall behind a vanity in a master bath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Choose your size</h3>
<p>If you’ve visited a tile store lately, you’ve probably noticed tiles are getting, well, bigger. Rectangular shapes can be found twice as wide as you may be accustomed to, such as 12” x 24”. Squares, too, have doubled in size, from 12” x 12” to 24” x 24”. Besides their fashion-forward appearance, there are several additional benefits: these larger sizes or formats actually make a small space, such as a bath, appear larger. There’s also fewer grout lines, which means faster installation and easier upkeep. However, the size trend doesn’t stop there. Designers are mixing sizes to create interesting effects, and you can, too. Combine wide and narrow wood planks, for instance, to achieve a custom effect, or alternate four small squares with one large square in the same size.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>A word about grout</h3>
<p>A decade or so ago, most tile installations used a white or off-white grout. It was adequate to blend into the tile’s appearance and still show the pattern. Now you can choose from dozens of colors to match your selection. Contrasting grout, however, has caught on, particularly with subway and other rectangular formats, to get a more graphic effect or to emphasize the shape of the tile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8212;<br />
Your choice in tile can influence the entire space it occupies. Here is how <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arthur and Kate</a> used stacked patterns in minimalist fashion, while <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kellys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-sweeten-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kelly</a> went bold with cement tile on the floor but subtly glamorous on the wall. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet’s</a> geometric backsplash become the kitchen’s centerpiece, while <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua’s</a> subtle 3D tile struck a perfect balance.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Brighten a galley kitchen</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>:  Anne, a <a href="https://www.studioparapluie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fashion illustrator</a>, bought her apartment in Brooklyn Heights over a decade ago and always knew she wanted to renovate the kitchen. The years went by and she &#8220;remained paralyzed at the prospect of finding a contractor and spending the money on such a large project.&#8221; She finally decided to treat herself to a complete renovation of the kitchen to make it more functional and beautiful. The tiny space (it was just 27 square feet!) had little light and was not enjoyable to cook in. She figured a wall between the kitchen and living space would have to come down. After interviewing a couple of firms that had been referred to her for the job that weren&#8217;t the right fit, she<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3801" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted her project </a>to Sweeten and was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Her Sweeten general contractor came up with a plan that offered practical solutions to reimagining her too-tight kitchen—including knocking down the wall between her kitchen and living room. They waited weeks for permits from the NYC Department of Buildings to remove the wall but finally got the approval to start demolition.</p>
<p>A peninsula replaced the wall, providing more storage and a space for entertaining. On the living room side, it hosts plenty of shelves and bookcases, perfect for Anne&#8217;s art supplies and book collection. There&#8217;s even a hidden outlet for a printer inside one of the cabinets and LED lighting underneath the unit too.  &#8220;The amount of storage that my contractor was able to include in the design–including shelving on the side for my cookbooks and a small wine rack—is truly miraculous,&#8221; Anne exclaimed.</p>

Instead of opting for the popular choice of white marble, Anne decided on a black marble countertop for most of the cook space. A hand-crafted maple wood countertop on the peninsula brings warmth, while brushed brass hardware and glass upper cabinet doors help set her desired tone of sophistication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;It feels as if I have moved into a brand new, luxury apartment! The abundance of light and the new functionality of this kitchen design have made me a very happy chef, and I am looking forward to making many hearty meals this winter from my favorite cookbook, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-Paris-Kitchen-Recipes-Stories/dp/1607742675" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>My Paris Kitchen</i> by David Lebovitz</a>,&#8221; she continued.</p>

<h2>&#8220;Sweeten connected me with an awesome, smart, and honest contractor, which is all you need to make it happen.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211;Sanaya K., Clinton Hill homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like a number of her <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/3-kitchen-renovations-in-brooklyn/">Clinton Hill Co-op neighbors</a>, homeowner Sanaya spent years living with decades-old cabinetry, outdated appliances, and unnecessarily cramped spaces before taking the plunge with a complete <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> renovation of her kitchen. &#8220;The kitchen was incredibly outdated,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;The cabinets were falling apart and I&#8217;m embarrassed to admit that there were cans of food holding up the shelves in one spot!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sanaya and her husband, Chris, had to contend with missing shelves and work around what looked like water damage from a prior leak. In addition, the original layout included a wall between the kitchen and pantry, which closed off both spaces and served no functional purpose. &#8220;It was tight,&#8221; Sanaya recalled. &#8220;Totally unnecessary, and made the space feel like a maze of walls.&#8221; Because of the placement of this dividing wall and the location of the refrigerator, counter space was seriously lacking. In her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/736">project post on Sweeten</a>, Sanaya did not mince words: &#8220;…everything must go.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After meeting with her Sweeten matches, Sanaya chose to work with Sweeten Expert, Alan, who helped bring together the homeowner’s renovation game plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10914 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/01_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/01_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/01_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10915 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/02_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/02_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/02_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10934 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/03_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/03_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/03_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sanaya took on three unconventional design choices to replace existing finishes: counter tops, the backsplash, and flooring. <span id="more-10886"></span>After plenty of online research, she was originally inspired by wood counters, &#8220;I love wood counters!&#8221;, she explained. &#8220;Alan was very helpful with pros and cons. I swooned over that idea but ultimately decided against them &#8211; I didn&#8217;t want to worry about the durability of the counters, near the stove and sink in particular.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alan helped to connect Sanaya with other homeowners who had considered similar choices and with an expert at Lowe&#8217;s in Red Hook who helped her determine the new kitchen layout. She ended up going with gray Caesarstone counters that beautifully offset the new, white shaker-style cabinets. For the backsplash, Sanaya chose a luminous blue-gray penny tile. Though they are more often used in bathrooms, here, the penny tile adds visual detail and pattern to the clean lines of the cabinets. Keeping with her goal of transforming and maximizing every last inch, Sanaya selected cork flooring, made in long planks, instead of the more typical square pieces. The natural accent brings warmth to the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10917 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/04_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/04_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/04_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10918 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/05_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/05_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/05_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10935 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/06_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/06_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/06_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sanaya and Chris (who, while renovating the kitchen, was simultaneously in the process of opening his second restaurant, <a href="https://www.centannibrooklyn.com/">Cent&#8217;Anni</a> in Crown Heights) were equal parts overwhelmed and happily immersed in the selection of these materials, and in the end, both are thrilled with the results. The new floor-to-ceiling cabinetry has dramatically increased the functional space of the kitchen. With the wall between the kitchen and pantry gone, Sanaya can easily access the additional storage and benefits every day from the counter space that was gained in the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10920 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/07_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/07_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/07_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10921 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/08_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/08_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/08_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10936 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/09_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/09_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/09_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;There are whole shelves that I haven’t even moved into yet! I feel like I can breathe and cook freely without chopping vegetables on top of my cookbook. I am obsessed with how awesome the deep and long drawers are for pots and pans – it makes accessing them so much easier.&#8221; The project&#8217;s obvious functional benefits also brought along welcome aesthetic benefits, as Sanaya noted, &#8220;I’m so glad that some of the cabinets are glass – we get to look at some of our beautiful things that don’t get used daily, but they’re not in the way. And I am equally glad that most doors are wood – I don’t want to look at my pantry and no one else does either.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10937 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/10_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/10_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/10_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While Sanaya and her husband are still playing with their new storage solutions and reveling in the new space, the completed renovation has left a hankering for more. &#8220;Now, I want to do so much more,&#8221; Sanaya says, laughing. &#8220;I want to rethink our living/dining room and perhaps install built-in shelves there and in the main hallway. And maybe it’s time to repaint our bedroom…the endless project!&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">This is certainly one of those renovations that I have been anticipating with bated breath. Partly because the amazing homeowners, Kyle, an IT professional at a law firm, and Angela, a freelance illustrator, have the style and the je ne sais quoi to totally charm; but also, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I love projects like this one</a>, where the homeowners have lived in the space, dreamed about what it will be one day, and saved up for years towards the goal of making that dream home their real home. It gives all of us who may still be far from that goal, a sense of possibility.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;We&#8217;d been living here for eleven years and things were starting to get a bit shabby. When we moved in, the apartment had been freshly renovated with all the cheapest materials available at Home Depot, which was fine back then, but we really wanted to make it &#8216;ours.&#8217; We saved up for renovations all the while and put a lot of thought into what we wanted to do.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;"> &#8211;Angela, homeowner</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">When the time had arrived early this year, Kyle and Angela (and their &#8220;mean, little chihuahua&#8221;) posted to Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to get started on renovating</a> their 900 sq/ft, 2 bedroom Clinton Hill co-op apartment. The road to selecting &#8216;the perfect contractor&#8217; was made a whole lot sweeter by our three suggestions; according to Angela, “we feel confident that any of the contractors Sweeten selected for us would have done a great job, but we&#8217;re really happy that we chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Kris</a>.&#8221; Kris and his team were able to take the homeowners&#8217; dreams of extra counter space for baking and a place that showed off their personal mid-century style, and turn them into a reality, on-time and within-budget!</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Kris&#8217; team worked closely with Kyle and Angela to meet their main objectives for the project: to create a modern, open apartment AND stay on budget. First order of business was making the &#8216;big moves,&#8217; which meant tearing down the non-structural interior walls and tearing up the outdated and damaged parquet flooring. With just these changes, the homeowners could already begin to anticipate their moment of, “I can hardly believe it&#8217;s the same place we&#8217;ve lived for the past decade!”<span id="more-10713"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10718 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/05_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/05_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/05_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">What I love about Kris and his team is that, not only are they exceptional at getting the work done well and on-time, but their custom millwork is always so impressive! They worked with Kyle and Angela&#8217;s mid-century modern aesthetic and came up with this gorgeous walnut custom cabinet system that I assure you will never wear out, but only wear in, as this lucky couple grows into their space. For their backsplash, the homeowners went bold with a bright green mosaic tile, <a href="https://www.mosaichse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R&#8217;ceef 5 in lime green</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Along with opening the kitchen came operation living-room-update-and-integrate. This meant that although that rich orangey/yellowish wall color is one of beauty, it needed to be refreshed and made more current with a clean, modern white. Underfoot, the old parquets were replaced throughout with new flooring in unstained white oak.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10721 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10722 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/09_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/09_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/09_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10723 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Although transitioning to a more modern aesthetic, Kyle and Angela wanted to keep a vintage vibe pulsing through their new space. The couple mixed mid-century based furniture, including a set of classic <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eames molded plastic/wire dining chairs</a>, a pair of vintage Heywood-Wakefield side tables, and a period-inspired <a href="https://www.radiusstore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elite Four walnut credenza</a> by Radius Innovative Design, with more current pieces like their <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble and stainless steel portica table</a> from Room &amp; Board.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10724 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">One of the best parts of tracking home renovations is seeing how people choose to highlight the art and objects that make up their personal collection. Throughout Kyle and Angela&#8217;s living area, the couple showcases their very impressive collection of prints by California-based artist, <a href="https://www.shag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shag</a>, and mid-century album covers by illustrator <a href="https://www.jimflora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jim Flora</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10725 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Over the dining table, they were able to bring some of that green from their backsplash out of the kitchen in another retro accent, <a href="https://www.rejuvenation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rejuvenation&#8217;s Astron Tri chandelier</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10727 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Kyle and Angela could not have been more excited to finally be rid of the outdated (Home Depot-centric) bathroom decor that they had come to love to hate (scroll to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see it here</a>), in exchange for their bright new, modern and material-rich space. The deep soaking tub from Kohler is cloaked, like the walls, in super white subway tile, and floating beside it is a dark oak Fresca Vanity with Versa faucet, both from <a href="https://www.decorplanet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decor Planet</a>. I personally love the texture that the carrera marble tiled floor adds to this sleek space.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10726 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">All in all, this home looks great and I can&#8217;t get enough of the true personality inside. Many thanks and congrats to the happy homeowners, Angela and Kyle! Also, big thanks to Sweeten Expert Kris, Natalia, and the rest of the team for the excellent work in making this home a whole lot sweeter!</p>
