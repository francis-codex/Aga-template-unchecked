			<h2>From condo to brownstone overhauls, a few of our favorite projects in the neighborhood</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Distinguished by its deep cultural and historic roots, Bedford-Stuyvesant, (aka Bed-Stuy) is a sprawling area also known for 19th-century brownstones, festive block parties, community gardens, and a lively culinary scene. Dough Doughnuts, anyone? The ever-changing neighborhood offers the best of what’s old and new, making it a place worthy of settling down and staying for a while. See how Sweeten renovators did just that and made Bed-Stuy home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32893 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-05-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, living room, brownstone" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having their hearts set on a Brooklyn brownstone led <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellamy and Zak</a> to a two-family home in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Restricted by the home’s layout and their budget, the couple focused on the structural changes that would most impact the flow. They flipped the house to make the top two floors the owner’s duplex and renovated the garden floor as the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-rental-in-a-brownstone-gets-fashionable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rental property</a>. Removing doors in the main entryway instantly opened up the space and created a larger living area. Two walls were torn down to expose the full length of the home—and two mismatched walls—which led to repointing and experimenting with painting techniques.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24342 mb-0 size-chrono" title="ktichen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, kitchen, renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/teacher-writes-lesson-kitchen-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ursula</a> loved almost everything about her recently converted two-bedroom condo—except the kitchen. Between the dark mahogany cabinets and flooring, the room felt anything but open. The space was revamped with white glossy cabinets, a geometric backsplash, and a sleek hood where the microwave used to be. Ursula and her Sweeten contractor got strategic when it came to storage: the new island featured three drawers for silverware, cutlery, and dishes, and they made the most of an underutilized area next to the oven by installing a pull-out spice rack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29885 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-11-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedforod-Stuyvesant, living room, brownstone" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It all came down to location during <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marsha and Adam’s </a>house hunt for their family. They searched across Brooklyn and at one point, New Jersey, before realizing the borough was the place for them. The two-family home they finally found in Bedford-Stuyvesant offered the space and light they were looking for, and just had a “good feeling about it.” A full renovation proved necessary to bring the 2,000-square-foot townhouse up to snuff. Taking inspiration from their #1 must-have—white oak floors—the couple set out to create a simple, clean vibe to carry throughout the home, including the all-white kitchen. The rest of the project centered on knocking down walls to open the living room, dining area, and kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_KV_Yard-03-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20478 size-chrono" title="backyard" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_KV_Yard-03-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn backyard, renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>Every New Yorker’s dream? An outdoor space to call their own. Inspired by the gardens of Mexico and Brazil, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-expert-santiago/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K.V. Harper</a> set out to turn the once unusable outdoor space behind her two-bedroom Bedford-Stuyvesant duplex into a lush retreat for entertaining. A framed cedar fence became the defining element of the oasis, encompassing different seating areas and gardening plots. Another fun bonus: The crew found bluestone during the demolition and repurposed it to build out a pathway leading to the yard.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-25524 noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25524 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedford-Stuyvesant, renovation, brownstone, home design" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-15-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-15.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry</a> weren’t expecting a gut renovation when they purchased their single-family home in the Bedford Historic District. While trying to sort out the mechanicals and ductwork, however, they came to the realization starting from scratch would be more efficient overall. To build a home that would grow with them over time, accommodate guests, and most importantly meet their day-to-day needs as a family, they set priorities. For him: the bells and whistles necessary to create a smart home, and for her, the flow and design crucial to making the house fit their lifestyle. The result? A welcoming, open home thoughtful of visiting and family friends. Seriously, the guest room was the first one ready!</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29878 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Marsha and Adam with daughters Sophie and Mila" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-04-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-04.jpg 999w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marsha and Adam searched long and hard for almost two years before they found the townhouse that would become their family home in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The pair—she, the CFO of a division at Siemens, and he, a manager of software development at Spotify—looked all over the borough, and even ventured into New Jersey before realizing that Brooklyn was where they needed to be. They found a brick two-family home that needed a lot of work, but the couple had a good feeling about it. It was “sunny, just the right size, and of course, within our budget,” says Marsha. Having lived for a while in a 720-square-foot Park Slope apartment with their two daughters, Sophie and Mila, they were excited for all the new space—just over 2,000 square feet on three floors, plus a basement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While the duo knew that they needed to gut the townhouse, the renovation and total timeline stretched across a year and a half. They moved into the home in the summer of 2015, pre-renovation, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors. They were matched with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect</a>, who worked with them on the plans for the renovation lasting close to a year. (A possible relocation to North Carolina for work delayed the project for three months, just as construction was about to commence.) Once the demolition began, the family of four moved into the garden apartment and camped out there for about half a year, until the work in the upstairs duplex was completed in December 2016.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The first must-have on the couple’s list was white oak floors. The rest of the design took inspiration from the simplicity of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardwood</a>. For the kitchen, Marsha and Adam decided on an all-white color palette, an unfussy, modern look inspired while scouring Pinterest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the main floor of the duplex (the second floor of the house), the couple knocked down the walls that chopped up the spaces, so that the living room, dining space, and kitchen were all connected as one open room. A hallway, which took up precious space, was removed, while a full bath was converted to a powder room (with a fun <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patterned tile floor</a>!) all to give more square footage to the kitchen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Working within a limited amount of space, their Sweeten architect came up with two solutions that would maximize the function and beauty of the kitchen, which faced the back of the house. She suggested that they add another window to the rear wall, and remove a non-functioning fireplace that was causing an awkward flow. The revised layout featured an L-shaped white Caesarstone countertop and white ceiling-height Shaker-style cabinets, as well as a new island. A large <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen pantry</a> held the recycling and appliances from view. A marble hex-tile backsplash added some variation while furthering the theme of modern simplicity. Three simple wood-clad steps lead to a deck and down to the backyard.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Each of the three bedrooms were <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/skim-coating-in-5-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coated</a> and painted in Benjamin Moore Super White, a perfect backdrop to the pops of color that the girls added to their rooms. The resulting home is modern yet warm and allows the couple’s mid-century modern-inspired furnishings, lighting, and art to take center stage.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-23.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29904 size-chrono" title="hallway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-23-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation Brooklyn" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-18.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29903 mb-0 size-chrono" title="washer/dryer closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-18.gif" alt="renovation Brooklyn" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the top floor of the duplex, the floor plan remained mostly the same, with a few minor changes. The hallway was widened for a more spacious feel. The two smaller bedrooms were evened out so that both Sophie and Mila would have similarly-sized rooms, and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer/dryer closet</a> was created so that they wouldn’t have to “schlep laundry up and down the stairs.” The original staircases were in terrible condition and a priority to be replaced. They now feature clean vertical lines—white posts framed by straight wooden rails that echo the white oak floors.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29906 size-chrono" title="basement landing" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation Brooklyn" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Marsha and Adam have put away the paint cans, they reflected on what was most difficult about the renovation: “The biggest challenge was living in a construction zone for five months,&#8221; the couple agrees. &#8220;It was tight, dusty, and messy. But it was a great way to keep track of the progress and make sure everything was being done as we expected. [Another] challenge was keeping our wish list reasonable. It is so easy to spiral out of control and decide you want every square inch renovated.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They were glad to have a Sweeten architect by their side. “The team was pleasant and easy to work with. I still can&#8217;t believe how great our experience was considering we were gutting our house. The key is communication, and we all worked very well together. Our advice is to find people who are easy to communicate with, and who have worked together in the past. When people know each other, they can more easily deal with issues that come up.” What do they love most about their new home? For Marsha, it was the sunny kitchen and backyard. And according to the children: all of it. &#8220;I think they truly love the house,&#8221; says their mother.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, they also wanted to share this nugget of wisdom: “Paying more for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproofing</a> the bathroom (so you don&#8217;t hear anything from your bedroom) is worth every penny. We really appreciated our Sweeten architect telling us that we ‘needed’ those more expensive items—she was right.”</p>
