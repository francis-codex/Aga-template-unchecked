<h3>An unwelcoming basement</h3>
<p>Proud. Calm. Organized. It was hard to imagine a trip down to our cellar—a dark, dank space that I never wanted to set foot in—summoning these feelings. But renovating this space into a fully functioning basement gave us a dedicated workspace for my business while adding an entire floor of living space to our home. It also satisfied some serious storage needs and gave us an occasional guest room for family visits.</p>

<div><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48715 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/49870-Danielle-Basement05.jpg" alt="" width="1110" height="740" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/49870-Danielle-Basement05.jpg 1110w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/49870-Danielle-Basement05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/49870-Danielle-Basement05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1110px) 100vw, 1110px" /></div>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We live in a three-family Brooklyn brownstone built in the early 1900s. We&#8217;ve owned it for three-and-a-half years. I am Danielle, owner of <a href="http://www.revampinteriordesign.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revamp Interior Design</a>; Jevaun is my husband and a design director; Zidane is our son and Katara is our dog. We occupy the parlor, garden, and cellar levels of the building, and the top floors are rental units. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47071" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-06.jpg" alt="basement remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/sweeten-brownstone-renovation-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we bought the place</a>, we have been redoing it one section at a time, and this was the last of the major projects. We wanted to do a renovation in the basement, which the previous owner had never refinished after a flood years ago. It wasn&#8217;t in great shape: the drywall had been ripped out to prevent mold, and the room had no ventilation or natural light. Junk was accumulating down there. The laundry area was way in the back, and we (I) had to walk through hell to do a load. It was sad.</span></p>

<h3>Organization for a basement remodel</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The space needed to become a beautiful workhorse of an office. But it had to function, too, as a standard basement and store our family’s things in an organized way. We needed places for coats, tools, luggage, and linens. I came up with this gallery idea with </span><span class="s8">a modern, open look, </span><span class="s1">and we posted our basement remodel project on Sweeten</span><span class="s8">. I wanted one wall to retain the exposed masonry, for texture and grit. For the floors, I planned to pour an epoxy layer over the existing concrete. My</span><span class="s1"> running joke: If I could walk through the basement barefoot, mission accomplished! </span></p>
<h3>Finding new general contractors</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I work in the renovation business, so I initially bid out the job with contractors I’ve worked with. But they were all tied up with projects. I didn’t want to have competing deadlines. Through Sweeten, I met some <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced general contractors</a>. We chose a contractor who seemed most capable and most excited about the job. The cherry on top: He was insanely easy to work with. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47066 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-01.jpg" alt="basement seating" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Lighting takes centerstage</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The goal was to make it bright and spacious. When we moved in, our vision included a den and guest bedroom in the basement. Then I started having this recurring (and prescient!) dream in which I was working from home, and the conversion plan shifted: I wanted to turn it into a design gallery and studio. I needed a workspace with a big, open surface to work with materials and review large drawings. Because of this, lighting would be key. Color is a big part of what I do and it felt critical to have a bright, blank canvas as the backdrop for my work.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47075" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-10.jpg" alt="washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>I knew that lighting was the aspect of the redo that would have the most impact. We put in 18 recessed LED ceiling lights; there was not a dark corner in the room. Susan Chan, a specialist at <a href="https://fengshuicreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feng Shui Creative</a> and a friend, recommended I add “uplighting”—fixtures that direct the light upwards—to lift the room’s energy. I thought she was crazy and couldn’t think how to make that work—the ceilings are barely eight feet high. But boy, was she right! The gorgeous pendant fixture I chose made a huge difference in the space, adding both diversity to the light and focus over the island.</p>
<h3>Epoxy floors for a chic basement remodel</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After we cleared out the stuff, the team sheetrocked the walls and poured the epoxy floor. The exposed masonry wall didn’t turn out as naturally beautiful as we’d hoped it would, but we went with it. The contractors built out closets under the stairs, installed a storage island for a work surface, and hung lots of open shelving. We painted the walls, floors, and stairs in a perfect white—not too cool, not too warm. The furniture plan was the toughest part. I find a “bonus room”—an everything space with 10,000 functions—the hardest to get right for my clients, and it was no different for me. I created a wide-open room and didn&#8217;t want the things I put in it to make it feel cramped.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47076" style="font-size: 16px;" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-11.jpg" alt="basement storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting to the finish line</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the room came together, our contractor stopped by often, checking on progress and clarifying details. He gave me a six-week project schedule. The basement remodel was finished the day he promised. The usual setbacks occurred—construction delays, order lags—and our project had surprises, but the crew kept pace and we didn’t go over budget. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten also offered support</a> throughout the project, if needed.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Looking at the finished project, I have so many favorite bits, beginning with the added space. Each floor of the building is about 900 square feet, so we increased usable space by 50 percent—we now have 2,700 square feet. The very best reward downstairs: the perfect lighting. I can work around the clock and never know what time it is. I jokingly call it Vegas!</span></p>

			<h2>Sweeten homeowners make work-from-home spaces permanent fixtures</h2>

<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sally and Aaron&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/office-kitchen-becomes-a-family-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home office remodel</a></p>
<p>Homeowners have been earnest in creating home offices for keeps. No longer just a temporary notion, working from home requires a dependable go-to space to fit an organizational system.</p>
<p>Whether you have a whole room or a nook to use, creating a functional space is possible. Below, Sweeten homeowners transform closets, basements, and small sections in kitchens into productive workspaces.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Kitchen office space</h3>
<p class="p1">As the hub of the home, a home office in the kitchen makes it available to the whole family. Even the most compact desk with a drawer is useful to sit and jot a note or look through a recipe.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg" alt="open kitchen with home office and dining space" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40958" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Out of the whole apartment remodel, Chris’ favorite part was the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/family-homecoming-hudson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in home office desk</a>. Erin and Chris’ design-build firm created an organized drawer and cabinet system matching the finishes of the kitchen. It was just right as a creative space. An organized system handled the constant flow of homework, art supplies, and collections.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A separate office wasn’t in the cards for Laura and Randy, but they </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found a solution: a kitchen desk niche</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s right off the main kitchen area and matches the rest of the white cabinetry. Bold, patterned wallpaper gives the desk a sense of separation from the rest of the kitchen, too.</span></p>

<p>With both Sally and Aaron working from home, a proper <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/office-kitchen-becomes-a-family-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen office space</a> would have a major impact on their daily lives. The layout they planned gave the galley a continuous flow and a large desk for their kids to use while the parents cooked. In addition, built-in cabinets surround the desk above and along the sides doubling the storage. Pull-out pantry-style doors hold stationery and desk supplies. Sally and Aaron spent $45,000–$50,000 on their new kitchen renovation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="patterned-floor-blue-wallpaper" class="alignnone wp-image-44769 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mollie-Office.jpg" alt="black and white patterned flooring and blue cabinets and a white desk space and blue wall paper and open white shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mollie-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mollie-Office-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mollie-Office-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With climbing prices in her Fort Greene co-op building, Mollie faced a problem. She could cash out (but deal with moving) or stay where she was. The neighborhood was ideal, but the look of her outdated 500-square-foot studio apartment was not. She decided to remain and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned to a Sweeten contractor</a> to help update her kitchen. Along with bright blue cabinets and dishwasher drawers, the contractor found space for a desk nook. As a result, Mollie chose bold wallpaper to set it apart as an &#8220;office.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="patterned-floor-kitchen-study" class="alignnone wp-image-44770 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Barbra-Office.jpg" alt="patterned black and white floor in a white kitchen and small study with white desk and white closed cabinets after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Barbra-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Barbra-Office-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Barbra-Office-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Barbra and Sean waited almost 10 years before renovating their 1,100-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home in Kensington, Brooklyn</a>. They knew exactly what they needed to make their space work better for their family. Their kitchen had an existing spot for a desk so it seemed <span style="font-weight: 400;">natural to carve out a similar area in their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully remodeled kitchen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as well. The renovators found a desk that fit right into the opening. They also used leftover wallpaper from their foyer to give it a finished look.</span></p>
<h3>A home office remodel transforms spare bedrooms</h3>
<p>If you have a spare bedroom, you can turn it—or just a part of it—into a beautiful workspace like the homeowners below. Bedrooms usually have good lighting, natural or overhead lights.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="wooden-table-brown-chest-of-drawers" class="alignnone wp-image-44765 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jenifer-Office.jpg" alt="wooden table and a brown chest of drawers in an office space with large window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jenifer-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jenifer-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jenifer-Office-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenifer Herrmann, a media executive, and her partner, Mitzie Wong, co-founder of creative design firm </span><a href="https://roarandrabbit.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roar + Rabbit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, found a two-bed, two-bath apartment for sale at a price that left them with a renovation budget. In addition to a kitchen and two bathroom renovations, creating a home office space for Mitzie was a priority for their remodel. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned the second bedroom into a home office</a>. It was the perfect space for Mitzie to separate work from personal life. She decorated it with her art materials, books, and growing plant collection. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="black-highlight-wall-office-space" class="alignnone wp-image-44766 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eric-Office.jpg" alt="black highlight wall in an office space with white desk and black chair and natural wooden floor after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eric-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eric-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eric-Office-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a work-from-home space was essential for first-time renovators Maria and Eric. They planned to include a home office in their 850-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment in Woodside, Queens. The couple worked with their Sweeten contractor <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/scandinavian-kitchen-renovation-crown-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to convert the second bedroom into a small office.</a> They designed it to keep with the Scandinavian-chic aesthetic featured in the other rooms in their home. </span></p>
<h3>Consider a home office remodel in unexpected places</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a saying: &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing that can&#8217;t be done.&#8221; That is just what these Sweeten renovators believed when trying to incorporate a home office into their living spaces. With out-of-the-box thinking, they envisioned spaces that would make working from home more comfortable. We love seeing how they squeezed their desks into creative places!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-16.jpg" alt="home office remodel from a bedroom closet" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44563" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Sweeten homeowner Beth required a fully functional <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-check-all-the-boxes-apartment-for-empty-nesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home office</a> in a dedicated space. In a clever swap, the master bedroom’s large double-door closet was flipped to be used in the second bedroom next door as a home office.</p>
<p>Discuss with your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a> if a work-from-home space is possible with your home layout.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="light-wooden-floor-white-bedroom" class="alignnone wp-image-44772 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cody-Office.jpg" alt="light wooden floor in a white bedroom with tiny study nook with white cabinets after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cody-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cody-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cody-Office-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>This beautiful corner apartment in Hudson Heights, Manhattan was a perfect spot for Marisa and Cody&#8217;s growing family. They turned to Sweeten to help renovate the space, with the goal of joining the kitchen and living area. They wanted the apartment to &#8220;feel open <span style="font-weight: 400;">and modern, but warm and homey at the same time.&#8221; They were able to fit into the design a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/open-kitchen-design-architect/">desk nook in the corner of one room</a>, utilizing the ceiling height by installing storage cabinets above the desktop. </span></p>
<div></div>
<p>What do you do with that little bit of extra room on your stairway landing? If you are creative like Dianna, an advertising agency director, and Todd, a college professor, you create a small office. The couple lives in a 440-square-foot studio alcove apartment, so space efficiency is critical. The office space is made possible by using a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/small-space-renovation-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corner table that fits perfectly on the landing</a> and floating shelves for storage and aesthetic interest.</p>
<h3>Multipurpose rooms combine work and play</h3>
<p>Sometimes you just can&#8217;t justify allocating a whole room to an office. Instead, you have to rethink the traditional concept of a home office and utilize what you have. One way to do this: turn parts of other rooms into your work area. Here, a look at Sweeten renovators who worked with that they had to make efficient, convenient work areas.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Millennial sisters Deanna and Daria found a one-bedroom in Manhattan that they could <span style="font-weight: 400;">convert into two. They worked with a contractor from Sweeten&#8217;s network to <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/millennial-sisters-buy-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revamp the awkwardly laid out floor plan</a> into a charming home. They reduced the size of the master bedroom to make way for a shared 7’ x 10’ closet workstation. The walk-in fit a home office decked out with a simple white desk, blue-fabric chair, and a desk lamp.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44777 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Toby-Office.jpg" alt="a multipurpose room provides work from home space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Toby-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Toby-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Toby-Office-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Since homeowner Toby had working knowledge of design and architecture, he was was very involved in his Manhattan co-op renovation. The living/dining area was open and spacious. Therefore, he set out to lay out a seamless space with multiple functions. He split the room into a dining area, office space, and sitting lounge (not pictured). A truly multi-purpose room!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="green-sofa-pink-pouffe" class="alignnone wp-image-44778 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gordon-Office_DixonProj-NotOurPhotography.jpg" alt="green sofa and pink poufee and cushions in an office space with white open shelves and white desk after renovation" width="1000" height="692" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gordon-Office_DixonProj-NotOurPhotography.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gordon-Office_DixonProj-NotOurPhotography-300x208.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gordon-Office_DixonProj-NotOurPhotography-600x415.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Gordon and Tracy looked to Sweeten to help them find a general contractor who they could trust to turn their townhouse in the Sunnyside Historic Garden District into a more family-friendly space. They knew they needed to use all three floors so, with the help of their contractor, they <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-basement-remodel-boosts-a-petite-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transformed the basement</a> into a dual living and utility/storage space, complete with an office area. The floating desk and shelves enlarge the room, leaving space for an entertainment area, laundry room, and second bathroom.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03-600x400.jpg" alt="conference office table" width="900" height="600" class="alignnone wp-image-45503" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Piper-Office-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>(Above) A <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/an-nyc-office-renovation-to-expand-working-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new commercial office remodel with Sweeten</a> for an NYC-based tech brand</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps you have outgrown your home office or coworking space or maybe your business is in need of a fresh location or configuration. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office renovation</a> will give you a chance to dream long-term about where your business is heading and interpret that direction into blueprints for a space that will facilitate growth. In this guide, we&#8217;ll consider the many pieces of your office renovation cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An office renovation can be as simple as an improvement project that is negotiated between the landlord and the tenant before signing a lease. Often these are very basic renovations such as fresh paint and some new walls that the tenant ultimately pays for in the cost of the lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are after something more custom, there are, of course, many variables that will determine the cost per square foot. Is the location a new or old building? Was it previously an office? What part of the country will your office be in? What are your business needs? And what quality of work will match those needs?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new building with a basic build-out of carpet, paint, and lighting, including equipment such as a photocopier and coffee machine costs about $40 a square foot, according to <a href="https://42floors.com/us/nv/las-vegas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42Floors</a>, a national search engine listing real estate for office space. On the higher end of the scale, a build-out with finishes such as wood veneer doors and a stone reception desk could hit $100 to $150 a square foot. The office renovation cost could also increase if you are renovating in an older building where quirky spaces and issues, such as slanted floors, must be taken into account. Whatever your tastes and needs, here are budget line items to consider.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs to hire an architect for an office renovation </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people will choose to hire an architect or designer. Expect that to take 20 percent of your renovation budget, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Carla</a>. That could mean $40,000 of a $200,000 budget. Bringing in a design professional early on may save heartaches in the long run. Along with the overall look and feel of the project, architects can also take care of code issues, assess if the workspace size will be comfortable for the number of employees, ensure handicap accessibility, design custom work areas, and more. “You can express creativity and individuality,” said Carla.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office lighting and electrical costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While planning an office remodel, first consider who will be coming to your office, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3218">Anthony, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. If clients are making regular visits, “you don’t want it to look like you’re working out of a bomb shelter,” he said. Decent lighting is one of those elements you can use to impress your clients, an impression that will hopefully lead to more business. Basic lighting can cost about $250 a point (a light with a switch is considered two points), according to Anthony. For each 110 volt outlet, put $150 in your budget, and don’t forget things like lighting for emergency exit signs, which are about $300 each, according to the website <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Move Your Office</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for millwork and finishes in an office</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is another area where you can keep costs down while still wowing potential clients with your new office space. “I’ve done work in lawyer&#8217;s offices where inside it is a vanilla box with cubicles that the clients never see,” said Anthony. “Then you have a lobby and conference room that is decked out with custom woodwork and imported marble.” One sample office budget at Buildings.com put the cost of millwork and finishes at about $25 a square foot. The total office renovation cost for that build-out came to $90 a square foot.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs to build walls</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similar to lighting and millwork, walls can differ greatly in cost. A basic partition wall that is ten linear square feet could cost around $60. Glass walls are not often priced per square foot and are instead sold as a package. However, using executive design elements such as glass walls could push the entire cost of your office renovation towards the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/64oqcghu49v4txd/Kirksey_ConstructionCostUpdate_2015_0.pdf?dl=0%20Paint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$150 </a>a square foot range.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office flooring costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commercial-grade carpet or a vinyl tile can cost <a href="https://naiglobal.com//journal_item_attachments/000/551/662/original/construction_costs.pdf?1421682262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as little</a> as $4 a square foot to supply and install. Wood plank floors can <a href="https://www.remodelingexpense.com/costs/cost-of-plank-flooring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost</a> around $7 a square foot for a 5,000-square-foot office. If there will be an industrial theme in your new office, then concrete flooring might be an economical option starting at $2 a square foot, according to the <a href="https://www.concretenetwork.com/concrete/interiorfloors/cost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concrete Network</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office bathroom costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many office buildings will have a communal bathroom area on each floor for tenants. If there is no bathroom, you must install at least one. <a href="https://americanrestroom.org/the-united-states-code-of-federal-regulations-for-toilet-facilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US code</a> requires one bathroom per one to 15 staff members. That climbs to six bathrooms for 111 to 150 staff.  A single restroom could cost a little under $15,000, according to <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Move Your Office</a>. If your staff likes to shower at work after jogging or riding into the office, a shower (make sure it is handicap friendly as per the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>), will cost just shy of $6,000.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Office kitchen costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An office kitchen can help team members feel appreciated. In the office renovation cost outline at the end of this article, Sweeten contractor Anthony installed an office bathroom and kitchenette. The total budget for those two items was around $16,000. The kitchenette, which consisted of a sink and fridge, took about 25 percent or $4,000 of that budget. Because the kitchenette and the bathroom were near each other, the project made double use of the plumbing to reduce overall costs. “It really depends on how much plumbing and millwork you need,” said Anthony. “You could have a simple cabinet or a whole countertop with a microwave, fridge, and sink.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fire protection</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on the building you are leasing, this could (hopefully) already be in place. If there is a sprinkler system, it is well worth spending a few hundred dollars to have an engineer inspect it to ensure it works and that it is up to current code. Installing a system from scratch in a small to a medium-sized office could set you back between $5,000 to $10,000, according to Anthony. He estimates that a sprinkler system will cost about $200 per sprinkler head, plus an additional $2,000 to have a plan drawn up as well as permits and inspections.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HVAC for offices</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping an office well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature can have a big impact on employee productivity. So, installing an HVAC—heating ventilation and air conditioning system—might be worth it if there isn’t already one in your new location. An HVAC system could cost between $15 to almost $30 a square foot or 15 to 20 percent of your entire office renovation cost, according to the Builder’s Association.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Labor costs for an office remodel </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a typical office renovation, labor should take about <a href="https://www.howtomoveyouroffice.com/tenant-improvement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ten percent</a> of your entire budget. However, consider the geographic differences in labor costs. For example, the cost of labor in New York City is 70 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/costs/kitchen-remodeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr</a>. Philadelphia is 40 percent and Dallas ten percent above the national average. Charleston, South Carolina, and Scottsdale, Arizona, are both one percent below the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certain factors in individual cities can add another variable. For example, in New York City, there are union and non-union buildings. For union buildings, tenants are required to use union labor, which can almost double the office renovation cost of a project, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. The basic build-out of an office in a non-labor building can be as little as $40 a square foot or as much as $100 a square foot in a labor building, according to <a href="https://42floors.com/edu/space-buildout/gauging-the-cost-of-an-office-build-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42Floors</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These small home office spaces &amp; design ideas show us how working from home has never looked better</h2>
<p>With more of the American workforce staying home for their 9 to 5 than ever before, having designated office space is important. Of course, not everyone has room for an entirely separate workspace, which is where small home office spaces come into play. Ahead, a few of our favorite inspiring spots for getting the job done from the comfort of your own home.</p>

<h3>Remodeling a brownstone for the future</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My wife B and I loved our little one-bedroom duplex in Hell’s Kitchen, but it had two drawbacks. It was small and the spiral staircase was a safety hazard we suspected would only worsen as we got older. Our budget was tight for the two-bed, two-bath apartment we wanted, but we felt it was time to make the move.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Focusing on Park Slope, we were outbid on two apartments: one that wasn&#8217;t perfect and another with a cute balcony. It became clear that we needed to look at apartments below our budget so we could bid higher, but there wasn’t much in that range.</p>

<h3>Finding a solution in a fixer-upper home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, I expanded my search to include places with only one bathroom, and saw an apartment pop up that fit our budget—the listing said, “Bring your contractor.” It was a big mess, but at least it was big! I rushed to an early open house on a Wednesday morning so I could be one of the first to see it. As I left, I texted B, “It needs a lot of work, but it just feels like home.” She came back with me that Sunday and was equally smitten with the place. We had to outbid 11 other offers, but this time, we got it!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18.jpg" alt="Living area with window nook alcove and open door to the office" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52131 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three-bed, one-bath (now two-bath) co-op is on the 2nd floor of a brownstone building in the center of Park Slope. The bathroom was in desperate need of an update, and the kitchen was more or less non-existent (there were a few cabinets and a sink). We didn’t know if we needed an architect, a contractor, a designer, or all of the above. After speaking to a few of each, none thought they could complete the work we needed in the range of our budget. That&#8217;s when we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/15942" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project</a> on Sweeten to find a contractor who had the experience to take on the work. We were matched with a few and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired our general contractor</a>.</p>
<h3>Opting for a full-home remodel in Brooklyn</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to take the plunge and do a full-home remodel on the Park Slope brownstone apartment, including installing new 5&#8243;-wide oak floors in a cherry stain, replacing crumbling plaster walls with drywall, and adding a washer/dryer in the hallway closet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17.jpg" alt="Office with black desk, book shelves, and large window" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52132 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16.jpg" alt="Living room with gray couch, gray walls, and a blue wall niche" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52130 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the sense of history in the home and wanted to save as many of the original features as possible. Some <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">molding was salvaged</a> and matched as closely as possible. The majority of the tin ceiling was saved along with the exposed brick walls and the Deco-style fireplace in our living room. The fireplace has a fresh coat of paint. Sadly, we weren’t able to save the beautiful French doors, but one now hangs horizontally on the living room wall as a piece of art.</p>

<h3>Making the space personal</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond matching the existing style, we wanted an apartment that felt cozy and creative. For me, as a writer, that meant lots of space for books. The existing small study, where one of the two doorways was removed and a transom was added, was the perfect spot for our collection. In addition, the writer in me also loved the bay window. I envisioned a banquette underneath for writing and lounging and storage as an added bonus. <span style="color: #333333;">Sitting curled up on that bench with a book is now one of my favorite activities. (Editor&#8217;s note: the owners added the banquette </span>after the photoshoot.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-52126 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="View of the open plan kitchen with counter space and seating, and adjacent hallway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="Kitchen with stainless steel appliances and gray cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52127 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen was probably the biggest transformation. The only appliance in the kitchen was a small, cheap stove that the sellers brought in for the inspection, a small sink, and a few metal cabinets. Luckily, that area needed very little demo! <span style="color: #333333;">Our contractor gave us a 3D rendering of our wishlist—a large peninsula for bar stools, ample storage space including deep drawers for our pots and pans, and the triangular configuration for our stove, sink, and fridge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="Kitchen counter with white marble countertops and white tile backsplash" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52129 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Finding the right accents and patterns</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We tried to bring in our “cozy and creative” feel through the fixtures and furniture. Our contractor sourced most of our materials⁠, besides the lighting and appliances. As a result, this gave us more time to focus on finding the right accent pieces.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_AimeeWalker_Apt04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-05.jpg" alt="Bedroom with colorful sham on the bed" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52117 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor helped us to figure out the best layout in the apartment. Since we were planning to put in a second bathroom, we wanted to create an ensuite master bedroom. Consequently, we removed a wall between the two rear bedrooms so the master would be next to the large walk-in closet. That closet became the master bath. As a result, we were able to build a new clothes closet. This also enabled us to annex some hallway space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Bathroom with blue walls, white tile, and glass shower door" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52113 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bathroom-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bathroom-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Rolling with the remodel process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though we love the end result of our new home in Brooklyn, the full home renovation process <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took a lot longer</a> than we had originally hoped. This was partly due to waiting for city permits, changes to our original plan, and the general busy schedule of our contractor. We were able to stay in our old apartment for some time because we had low carrying costs, and held off selling it as long as possible. When we finally put our old place on the market, it sold quickly and we moved into the new place with only a few weeks&#8217; notice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07.jpg" alt="Light blue bedroom with a striped bed sham and Florida poster" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52119 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">Our contractor&#8217;s team got it to a “move-in ready” state in time for our move, but we realized that our idea of move-in ready differed from theirs. The floors were dry enough to put our furniture down, but none of the kitchen appliances worked. We had one functioning toilet with the only working sink in the kitchen. B and I had an interesting experience making ramen with our coffee maker and eating tuna out of a pouch.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, that rough patch just made us appreciate our wonderful new kitchen and the whole apartment even more. And we still love all the little details that make this apartment uniquely ours.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Aimee and B, for sharing your cozy Park Slope brownstone remodel with us! </em></p>

<p><em>In our month-long Organizational Blitz, see how Sweeten homeowners have whipped their homes into shape.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30038 mb-0 size-chrono" title="newsletter-banner" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2-723x482.jpg" alt="newsletter banner" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to keeping your home in good shape, every space—from the bedroom to the bar—has a role to play. Even if you’re a minimalist, you’ve got plenty of stuff to store (perhaps a little less than the rest of us), and creating storage that can accommodate everything is crucial. If you find yourself closer to the maximalist end of the spectrum (count us in!), whether you’ve got a growing pile of books or an impressive liquor collection, getting organized is possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25922 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bookshelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-13-723x1095.jpg" alt="home organization" width="723" height="1095" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With bookshelves, you don’t have to consolidate your collection of books to maintain order in your home. Any room can host your library—and we’ve got 5 ways to prove it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_MarioApt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22188 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_MarioApt-06-723x517.jpg" alt="home organization" width="723" height="517" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best organization strategy takes into consideration every room in your home, including the bedroom. From floating shelves to custom built-ins, find spots for all of your personal belongings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30096 mb-0 size-full" title="desk nook" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="home organization" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-723x482-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-723x482-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>

			<h2>Need WFH space? Add a nook desk to any kitchen or studio apartment, like these homeowners did</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2.jpg" alt="living room desk nook mid century" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38155" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost two years after the global shutdown, it seems likely the workplace will never look like it did before COVID-19. More companies and employees are exploring the hybrid model of work (part work-from-home, part in-the-office) or full remote on a permanent basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Makeshift &#8220;lap offices&#8221; are upgrading to become permanent home features. And limited square footage is no longer a hindrance. The creativity of carving out a nook desk is growing. Whether a built-in nook desk or a desk area for a studio apartment, see how these Sweeten homeowners have reinvented their workspace.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches residential renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering know-how, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Built-in kitchen office nook for ultimate convenience</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-25.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39893" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-25.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-25-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-25-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura and Randy first saw their Upper East Side</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-op, they weren’t impressed. It felt cramped and not their style. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with their contractor, they decided to open the space between the kitchen and dining room, adding a large island. A built-in desk niche would be accessible for when they worked from home. It would also serve as a homework station for their daughter, Mor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gan, as well. The result is a stylish and convenient small nook that holds court in the kitchen.</span></p>
<h3>A kitchen office nook with maximum organization</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg" alt="open kitchen and dining space" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40958" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08.jpg" alt="desk niche" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40964" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/family-homecoming-hudson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erin and Chris&#8217; 1950s co-op</a> left a lot to be desired.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It was on the smaller side, so they got creative with the layout to ensure they could get all the “extras” they wanted. They worked a built-in desk and cabinet system into their plans. This allowed the couple to organize their work as well as have a neat and tidy place for the kids’ schoolwork and art supplies. Even with a full kitchen and bathroom renovation, the new kitchen office nook is still Chris’ favorite part of the home.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A former closet turns into a desk in a studio apartment</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27739 size-chrono" title="desk nook in Lauren's studio" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg" alt="home office" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>After relocating her clothing storage to a larger space, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren&#8217;s Sweeten contractor</a> added a custom desk nook to the spot where her old closet stood. Three simple slabs<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>two deep shelves above and a desk surface<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>do the job.</p>
<h3>A modular desk in a living room adds functionality to a wall</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27740 size-chrono" title="Vitsoe modular unit" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="home office" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>A Vitsoe modular unit was the perfect way for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/mid-century-mad-men-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom and Alex to create an organized desk nook</a> in a sunlit corner of their living area. Its clean lines and silhouette blend seamlessly with the home&#8217;s mid-century style.</p>
<h3>Creative nook desk in a studio apartment</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27741 size-chrono" title="desk nook in Emily's studio" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="home office" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily&#8217;s new office nook</a> desk replaced two small, unusable closets. The desk in the studio apartment, which provides storage for papers and books, is an ideal workspace in her small home since it’s down the hallway from her sleeping area.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-24-v2.jpg" alt="Kensington, renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38725" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-24-v2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-24-v2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-24-v2-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-24-v2-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/featured-slider/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbra and Sean lived in their apartment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a while before deciding what to renovate. Their kitchen would be completely updated. In the existing kitchen, there was a desk area already so it just felt natural to carve out a similar area specifically for this use. Luckily, they were able to find a new desk that fit the opening perfectly. They spruced it up even more with leftover wallpaper from their foyer refresh. Now, they have an inviting place to work.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I was helping <a href="https://sweeten.com/about">Peter</a> with his new home office,  there were tons of issues that came up that needed to be addressed, and Peter took to saying &#8220;let&#8217;s ask my architect what to do.&#8221;  That phrase, &#8220;my architect&#8221; is one of those statements that implies so much, without really saying it. Like &#8220;my country home,&#8221; &#8220;my nanny,&#8221; and &#8220;my interior designer&#8221;&#8211; only the rarified few dare even think of having such things.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I love these fabulous resources that offer design help for the rest of us. And at Swee10 when you post your project you get estimates from many fantastic interior designers at once!<span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #0000ff; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #ff0000; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><br />
