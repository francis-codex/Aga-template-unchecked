<p style="text-align: justify;">After posting last week&#8217;s look at <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-interior-design-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interior design in NYC</a> and scouting the photos our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation/follow-us-sweeten_home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">50,000+ @SWEETEN_HOME Instagram followers</a> love most, I have been thinking about the relationship between beauty and function in a home. Hat tip to <a href="https://www.designsponge.com/2014/04/wise-words-by-william-morris.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Sponge</a> for reminding me of this quote:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Have nothing in your house that you don&#8217;t know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.&#8221;</h3>
<p style="text-align: right;">~ William Morris, writer, artist, designer (1834-1896)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First thought: YES! So true! And such a smart antidote to our collective tendency for accumulating stuff. Second thought: perhaps if Mr. Morris had lived in 21st century New York City, he might have amended his statement to require that things be both useful and beautiful, and not one or the other. When you only have a few hundred square feet to yourself, you start to realize that beautiful things should be functional, and functional things should be beautiful. Whether you&#8217;re contemplating a renovation, enjoying a recently completed project, prepping your home to put it on the market, or just looking to make the most of what you have, may I humbly suggest a few ways to edit, de-clutter, and organize to get you out of your home and into the world this summer! With William Morris&#8217;s sage words in mind, here are three tips to get you started.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. Take a look in each room of your home and separate clutter into two categories: things you can display and things you need to stow away.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lots and lots of everyday household items are really lovely. You don&#8217;t need to buy pricey accessories to make your home welcoming and useful. Open up your cabinets and grab things that don&#8217;t need to be hidden away &#8211; glassware, tea canisters, books, jewelry, plants &#8211; you are probably using storage space for things that would add visual interest and detail to a room if you took a few minutes to arrange them. To be clear: my coffee table is hardly a model for a design vignette, but after rooting around for some items that were stowed out of reach, re-purposing a glass container from a neighborhood juice spot, stacking odd books I&#8217;ve collected along the way (a French comic book, an anthology of fairy tales, a design book that was a housewarming gift from an old friend), finding a succulent that needs zero care, and moving a serving tray out of a cupboard, I have a passable little gathering spot made entirely of things I already had.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11500 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/02_Sweeten_KerryEditting-600px.png" alt="decluttering-home-nyc" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/02_Sweeten_KerryEditting-600px.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/02_Sweeten_KerryEditting-600px-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, I keep reasonably beautiful and functional items on the counter so that they are within reach, and so that they aren&#8217;t taking up storage space. Pastas are in glass jars on the counter along with olive oil, tea &#8211; all things I use daily (or, you know, when I cook on a quarterly basis) and don&#8217;t mind looking at frequently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now the reverse is perhaps a bit more challenging:<span id="more-11493"></span> are there items laying around that just don&#8217;t work as carefree design accessories? If those items are neither functional nor beautiful, consider getting rid of them. If those items are functional but not beautiful, find them a new home that is out of sight. Your dining table, kitchen counter, and floors are not options, so don&#8217;t even think about it! If you must, proceed to tip #2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. If your home&#8217;s existing storage options are bursting, invest in storage that is worth displaying. </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11499 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/01_Sweeten_KerryEditting-600px.png" alt="declutter-home-nyc" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of my tea (enough with the tea? sorry!) comes in decorative canisters; some of it comes in messy boxes. I found these delightful white ceramic storage containers to store the non-glamorous tea and other cooking needs. They are stylish and functional and under $30. Below the coffee table, I stow&#8230;.wait&#8230;I can&#8217;t remember what I keep in those boxes because I never open them. Nevertheless! I have easy access to things I might be keeping in those simple Muji boxes, without having to see those items daily. I also found these Ankasa trunks that double as a side table and as a guest-bedroom (extra bedding and towels in there). If you are looking to replace furniture or re-work the lay-out of your home, hiring an interior designer will help ensure that you find pieces and accents that are both functional and beautiful. Which leads me to the third and most extreme de-cluttering tip&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. Find double-duty furniture and build custom storage.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are contemplating using the oven for storage (it is SO spacious in there!), please pause. There are a handful of furniture options that take our William Morris mantra to new heights and there are ways to maximize your home&#8217;s square footage with custom storage. Benches that double as trunks, trunks that double as coffee tables, media consoles that double as benches and trunks&#8230;behold: I found this Jonathan Adler gossip bench which expands seating in my eight foot living room and simultaneously conceals winter wardrobe options. Also, I have a vacuum stored underneath, because that seemed to be the best alternative to hiding it behind my living room curtains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11501 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/03_Sweeten_KerryEditting-600px.png" alt="decluttering-home-nyc" width="600" height="412" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/03_Sweeten_KerryEditting-600px.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/03_Sweeten_KerryEditting-600px-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The goal here is not to have a home that looks like it found its way out of a magazine cover, the goal is to spend less time managing the things you have so that you can spend more time doing the things you love.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten experts spend all day, every day, creating smart and beautiful spaces that are unique to each homeowner. For inspiration from fellow New Yorkers who went all in with gorgeous and super-functional custom storage solutions, take a look at this <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/west-village-studio-shelving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simple Sweeten shelving solution in the West Village</a>, our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pricing guide to custom built-ins</a>, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/portfolios/1733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this swoon-worthy project by Sweeten Expert Daniel</a>:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday <a href="https://sweeten.com/about">Jean</a>, Becky and I visited <a href="https://www.bklyndesigns.com/">Bklyn Designs</a>, the annual showcase at St. Ann&#8217;s Warehouse for local designers and craftspeople. There were upholsterers, woodworkers, carpet makers, and metalsmiths there, all showing off the beautiful things they produced in their Brooklyn studios.</p>
<p>Two rising furniture-makers with very different sensibilities made a big impression.</p>
<p><a href="https://colleenanderic.com/">Colleen and Eric</a> design lovely, playful home furnishings inspired by far-fetched ideas. Small brass rivets are recessed into the dark wood top of the &#8220;Northstar Table&#8221; like stars in the constellation. If you locate the northstar and press down on it, a secret side drawer slides open. It&#8217;s the perfect place to stash a diary, jewelry, or contraband.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1306/4609972374_d29e761b2b.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC NIGHTSTAR TABLE" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3580/4609972472_cb9653e2ff.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC NIGHTSTAR TABLE DETAIL" /></p>
<p>Colleen and Eric&#8217;s &#8220;Hold on Tight Bookshelf&#8221; takes unlikely inspiration from the image of books toppling sideways off an open shelf. This simple maple shelf is capped at one end and has a brightly-colored, sliding metal stop at the other. The toy-like mechanism is a pretty accent and also a lot of fun. Becky couldn&#8217;t stop playing with the display model and Jean and I finally had to drag her away.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1188/4609972250_b3539e1cfa.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC HOLDONTIGHT" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3538/4609972550_fcf110dd4a.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC HOLDONTIGHT DETAIL" /></p>
<p>Colleen and Eric also make accessories like tote bags and keychains. Their product lines are sure to expand further as they&#8217;re struck by new ideas. It &#8216;ll be fun to see what they&#8217;ve come up with at next year&#8217;s fair.</p>
<p>In contrast, the pieces from Kai-Wei Hsu&#8217;s shop <a href="https://www.kwhfurniture.com/">KWH Furniture</a> take inspiration from the elemental qualities of the woods that they&#8217;re made from. The furniture in the new &#8220;Vice&#8221; line doesn&#8217;t shout out for attention. Each piece has a clear, modern sensibility and yet is so restrained so that it wouldn&#8217;t feel out of a place in a traditional interior.</p>
<p>The elegant &#8220;Bar Cart&#8221; is made from white oak with a cerused finish. The first thing you&#8217;re drawn to is the fine grain and stain of the wood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3587/4609973164_ba67d01791.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART" /></p>
<p>Then, as you lean in closer, you understand the exquisite workmanship of the piece. The outer corners of the frame are held together with wood splices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1404/4609972720_04fb2bdf7e.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART DETAIL 01" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4019/4609973430_5fff0ce9ab.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART DETAIL 02" /></p>
<p>The similarly elegant &#8220;Vanity Table&#8221; is made from black walnut with an oil finish. Its proportions are perfectly balanced. The first think that strikes you is the sumptuous finish in the wood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1317/4609363631_a18322cabf.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY" /></p>
<p>Then when you move in closer, as you&#8217;re bound to do, you see how subtly and precisely the drawers are fitted.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1274/4609363865_1d49899a26.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY DETAIL 03" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3332/4609363461_74f96200a4.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY DETAIL 02" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how Kai-Wei&#8217;s designs evolve as he explores new materials and details. Whatever direction the pieces take, I&#8217;m certain they&#8217;ll all have the same immaculate craftsmanship.</p>
