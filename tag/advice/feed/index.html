<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-11.jpg" alt="kitchen with white waterfall island" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45705" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></h3>

Photos by Kate Glicksberg.</span></p>
<h3>Why is the scope of work important?</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Scope of work” or &#8220;scope&#8221; is construction lingo for the list of work that needs to be done in a remodeling project. When a contractor asks for <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your project scope</a>, they’re really asking, “What are all the things you need me to do?” Sweeten breaks it all down below.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Sweeten</span><span class="s1"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is the scope of work?</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Early in your planning, like when you first post your project on the Sweeten platform or start talking to general contractors, your scope will likely be vague. For example, “I want to renovate the master bathroom, including retiling and replacing cabinets and fixtures.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Later, when it comes time to ask general contractors for estimates, you’ll work with them to fill in the details. These important details make up the scope of work! The details will cover the exact work that needs to be done, including materials and fixture specifics, and plans drawn for any changes to the layout, pipes, or wiring (see “Renovation scope of work example” below). </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All the specifics need to be in writing by the time you ask for a contract. Once you’ve signed, additional changes to the scope of work are considered “change orders,” and will bring additional costs.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Finessing your budget and scope of work</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Often, you won’t be able to move from a general to specific scope until you know the cost of all the options. We suggest making a list of everything you want, divided into <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“must-haves” and “nice-to-haves.”</a> Your general contractor can help you decide on a specific scope that fits your budget, including as many “nice-to-haves” as possible. </span></p>
<h4>My scope exceeds my budget. Now what?</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If your contractor makes <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/can-i-ask-my-contractor-for-a-revised-estimate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an estimate that exceeds your budget</a>, it’s time to negotiate. Please don’t just ask for a discount. General contractors operate on very low margins; you’d be asking them to lose money. Instead, ask questions about how to adjust the scope to fit your budget. You might get some surprising and imaginative ideas. Sweeten general contractors are often wizards at this kind of creative problem-solving to make potential clients happy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A remodeling rule-of-thumb: The more rigid your budget, the more flexible your scope should be. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">If a scope of work isn’t possible</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Occasionally a general contractor will tell you that something in your scope is impossible. This can be disappointing—but we promise, they’re not just being difficult. Sometimes there will be structural reasons that something can’t be done. Other times there will be strict national or local building codes that have to be obeyed. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pro tip: Always ask why something in the scope can’t be done. You might start a conversation with your contractor that leads to ideas that are just as satisfying as the original.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Prep scopes before the estimate</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You might want to consider more than one scope. For example, one version might be a kitchen remodel that includes changing the floor plan and opening a wall. Another version could be a simple rip-and-replace of the existing cabinets and finishes. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s fine to present these alternate versions to your general contractor, as long as you do so before asking them to create any estimates. And you should keep it to just two variations. Beyond two, your contractor might ask for an additional deposit—because drawing up detailed estimates is time-consuming work.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Example of a scope of work in construction</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Replace toilet<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Replace vanity cabinet<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Change out sink<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Retile floor<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Relocate shower—see plans<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Install cement board<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Tile shower/tub surround<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Replace light fixture<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Add outlets—see plans<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Paint walls and ceiling</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The scope of work, in summary</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Start with a general scope, with your must-haves and nice-to-haves. Moving on to your final, detailed scope requires negotiating many variables. Your Sweeten general contractor can be a valuable resource in this process. Be sure to communicate clearly, ask questions, and give as much information as possible before requesting a bid. And remember: the details in a contract finalize your scope. Any additions to the scope after you’ve signed the contract will be considered a change order, which might push you over budget.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Sweeten matches you with vetted general contractors</h3>

<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/live-through-kitchen-remodel-1.jpg" alt="Kitchen in the middle of a renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52709" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/live-through-kitchen-remodel-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/live-through-kitchen-remodel-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/live-through-kitchen-remodel-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Remodeling your kitchen is a smart move and you’ll be pleased that you took the leap and did it. However, for a short time during the project, you might feel some&#8230;frustration, especially if you are accustomed to being at home most days.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s all manageable, however, and you’ll do fine if you know what to expect. It’s all about adaptability and making as many choices proactively as possible. Get things set up before it feels like an emergency. You’ll be inconvenienced for several weeks or so, if the project goes as planned. Sweeten outlines how to live through a kitchen remodel below.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Set up a temporary kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1">Naturally, you’ll have to feed the family and clean up after meals and snacks, so you’ll need some sort of temporary kitchen. If you have room for a temporary kitchen, old dismantled kitchen cabinets could create a makeshift mini-kitchen space. Even some of the old countertop could be used.</p>
<p class="p1">If you don’t have an extra room, where can you carve out some space for, say, 2–4 weeks? You might use the patio/deck and grill for a lot of cooking and the default dining table, if the weather cooperates.</p>
<p class="p1">Moving the refrigerator to a space where it’s still usable is typically mandatory. Go over changes like these with the contractor so you don’t block a space they’ll need to access.</p>
<p class="p1">You might wonder if the fridge can move to the deck or patio, and it’s possible, but it&#8217;ll depend on the weather. Refrigerators have an ambient operating temperature range, and if the outdoor temperature goes below ~40 degrees, the compressor won’t run. If the compressor doesn’t run, then the freezer won’t work. Likewise, avoid setting a refrigerator in full sun. The heat will force the compressor to work much harder and more often, which will shorten its life.</p>
<h4>Cooking without a normal kitchen</h4>
<p class="p1">Cooking is really pretty easy. You can use a camp stove, toaster oven, microwave oven, instant pot, and/or grill for numerous meals. You probably can’t move and use your freestanding range, as they require a 240v outlet and dedicated circuit for power.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Staying at home during a kitchen remodel</h3>
<p class="p1">If you are accustomed to being at home quite a bit, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process of construction might unnerve you</a>. Naptime for the kids will be tough to keep going, as will any work duties you plan to accomplish. Going to the office a bit more may turn into an attractive option, along with coffee shops and shared office spaces.</p>
<p class="p1">Do the daily work hours work for you? Tradespeople often start early and their work is often noisy. If you like to sleep in, you will probably chafe at having workers at the house early in the morning, but that’s what it takes—temporarily.</p>
<p class="p1">Talk with your contractor about the daily schedule to set shared expectations. Surprises happen and everyone has to roll with them. An organized and professional contractor will set you up as well as possible.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Living in a hotel during the remodel</h3>
<p class="p1">Another option that has unique benefits is staying at a hotel. You can choose a standard stay or an extended-stay suite, which may even have a mini-kitchen. These offer clear and compelling advantages: low commitment and high flexibility, as in booking and leaving with little notice.</p>
<p class="p1">Cost may seem high but it may be well worth it to avoid the chaos of living in a remodeling zone. You will have to live somewhere during the work, so a hotel could be just part of the project budget.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Create a contingency plan to cover surprises</h3>
<p class="p1">Finally, have a contingency budget plan of 10-15% if something goes awry. The worst-case scenario would be something like discovering asbestos or mold, which must be professionally remediated. Those professionals are specialty crews, not your contractor or subcontractors. That could stop other work until they are done. There’s no good way to estimate how long that work could take, but your general contractor will know how to find the experts and rearrange the schedule and sequencing.</p>
<p class="p1">Other common scenarios are occasional shortages of materials or <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mistakes in ordering or fulfillment</a>. Special-order items, for example, can be subject to delays. Luckily, a good contractor can peruse your plan and spot potential bottlenecks quickly, but it’s good to be prepared.</p>
<p class="p1">There’s a lot to consider for a kitchen remodel, but the hassle is temporary and the benefit is long term. With preparation and a flexible mindset, you’ll be on the way to your dream kitchen.</p>

			<h2>Want an eco-friendly remodel? Consider these methods to improve your L.A. home&#8217;s energy and water efficiency</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-02-1.jpg" alt="Remodeled dining area in Los Angeles with wood flooring and fresh white walls" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-49426 size-full" title="Sustainable home remodeling in Los Angeles" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-02-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-02-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Renovating a house in L.A.’s extreme climate requires special measures. </span>Heat is intense during the summer and water is always in a shortage. Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractors offer advice on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainable home remodeling</a> in Los Angeles with energy and water conservation in mind.</p>
<h3>Energy conservation in L.A.</h3>
<p>“Energy conservation and cool conservation are the same thing,” said L.A.-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5914" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor Chen</a>. If you can adequately cool the home, you have gone a long way toward conserving the heat, too. The best place to start conserving heat is with airtightness.</p>
<h3>Airtightness</h3>
<p>“Think of your house as a bucket of water,” said Chen. “If you have any holes in the bucket, that’s water escaping from the bucket. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/weatherize/air-sealing-your-home">Airtightness</a> is the same with your home.”</p>
<p>The aim is to prevent conditioned interior air from escaping—whether cool or warm air. There are airtight home products that can help with this. For instance, caulk is used around stationary home elements like door and window frames. Weatherstripping is also used for movable components, such as the door itself or the window sash.</p>
<h3>Home insulation types</h3>
<p>Home insulation is a requirement for all new construction and remodeled homes. Whether holding in heated or cooled air, a wide range of home insulation projects can help.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6071#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor Jose</a>, also based in Los Angeles, noted that spray foam insulation is becoming increasingly popular. Spray foam insulation is especially good for vaulted ceilings since it conforms to voids in the building envelope.</p>
<p>“More people are adopting spray foam insulation,” said Jose, “though it is a little bit dirtier than some other types of insulation,” meaning that foam will off-gas. But in the end, he noted, when you do a cost-benefit analysis, you might come out ahead environmentally.</p>
<p>While fiberglass is still the main type of home insulation used in remodels, it’s not the only product out there. Every so often, he will use denim insulation, mainly because it is eco-friendly and excellent for soundproofing.</p>
<h3>Home heating and cooling systems</h3>
<p>That traditional feature of Southern California side yards—the hulking HVAC unit—may soon pass into oblivion.</p>
<p>VRF (variable refrigerant flow) units are far smarter and more green than central units, which heat or cool the entire house at once. “These are far better than traditional central air,” said Chen. “These products adapt to the areas of the house where you need the heat or cooling.”</p>
<p>As an example, you might have <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 5-bedroom house</a> with separate variable refrigerant flow units in each room. All units are connected to one large outdoor unit. This unit senses the needs and knows how to provide each unit with the right amount of heating or cooling.</p>
<h3>Underfloor heating</h3>
<p>In extremely cold climates, underfloor heating exists only to make your bare feet more comfortable on tile. But in moderately cool climates such as L.A.’s, underfloor heating can be used for heating rooms. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most common installation</a> of underfloor heating is in <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathrooms</a>.</p>
<p>Sweeten contractor Chen said, “When you think about the physics of heating, heat goes up. So heat that starts at the floor is most effective.” Chen finds that the most efficient and sustainable type is water-based (hydronic) radiant heating systems, rather than electric cable systems.</p>
<h4>Using solar power for home heating and cooling</h4>
<p>The final and necessary component of home heating and cooling is solar power.</p>
<p>Los Angeles general contractor Jose does a lot of solar installations but it always depends on the clients’ budgets. He added that many clients like to go off-grid in terms of power. But off-grid doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re isolated out in the country. These are homes in the metro area.</p>
<p>Solar power helps reduce the power draw for heating and cooling systems. Robust solar power systems even allow the homeowner to sell back credits to the power company.</p>
<h3>Water conservation at home in L.A.</h3>
<p>With water being so precious in L.A. and across all of Southern California, water conservation in <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home remodels</a> is no longer a choice; it’s a given. Luckily, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractors have a number</a> of weather-conserving initiatives to use during remodeling.</p>
<h4>What is greywater?</h4>
<p>Greywater is any residential wastewater that isn’t septic waste (water from toilets or urinals). Greywater can be drainage from bathtubs, showers, kitchen and bathroom sinks, washing machines, or dishwashers.</p>
<p>Depending on clients’ budgets, Sweeten contractor Jose often does greywater reuse installations. At this time, greywater reuse is only approved for irrigation in Southern California.</p>
<p>Tax credits for greywater reuse may be available. But he cautions that credits likely won’t cover the cost of the greywater reuse installations—at least not for the first few years.</p>
<h4>Rainwater collection</h4>
<p>Contrary to popular thought, it does rain in Southern California. Just ask a resident during one of the El Niño periods from September to November. Some years get up to <a href="http://www.laalmanac.com/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 to 40 inches of rain</a>, according to the Los Angeles Almanac.</p>
<p>Rainwater collection can be as easy as purchasing rain barrels on your own to collect water runoff from the roof. Or you can speak with your contractor about larger capacity water harvesting systems as a sustainable solution.</p>
<h4>Los Angeles water conservation rebates &amp; credits</h4>
<p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has <a href="https://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/faces/ladwp/residential/r-savemoney/r-sm-rebatesandprograms;jsessionid=KyJZhcbFtkrjGLg79Lp998y7rMQYm8CLfVTnKsr2vcnsJJHJ2p55!415314039?_afrLoop=298325548010414&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_afrWindowId=null#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D298325548010414%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dy0dogbh89_4">rebate programs that may help compensate</a> you for water conservation remodels. You may be able to be rebated for drought-tolerant landscapes or high-efficiency eco-friendly washing machines. Read up on the full range of credits and rebates and discuss what your <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">options are with your contractor</a>.</p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Deciding whether to convert a bathtub into a shower</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bathtubs have their place, but most of us take many more showers than baths. So why were most bathrooms outfitted with a bathtub rather than a walk-in shower over the last few decades? The simplest answer is flexibility. You can take a shower in a bathtub, but not vice-versa. Also, families with children do well with a bathtub, and they’re useful for bathing dogs. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, stepping over the tub rail every time you shower is not ideal, and is not possible for many people. If you&#8217;re ready for a change, this guide by Sweeten lays out how to convert a bathtub to a shower (luckily, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward!)</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Showers are ideal for aging and multi-generational families</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Converting a bathtub into a shower has become much more common as our population ages, aided by the increasing popularity of accessible and<a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> universal design</a>. These design concepts are aligned with the Americans with Disabilities Act and include features such as entry ramps in place of stairs, rocker-style light switches, and lever-style door handles in place of knobs. The magic of this approach, even when not mandated, is obvious with multigenerational families, or when you find yourself with an injury or chronic health condition. These thoughtful home designs can accommodate your needs however they may change.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a bathroom remodel, the shower can use a curbless entrance that doesn’t impede a wheelchair user. (Another benefit of the curbless design is its streamlined, modern look!) Another popular feature y</span><span class="s1">ou can specify is a built-in or removable bench. Even better, there is a multitude of design and hardware options to add these elements.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="light-tiled-bathroom-with-mirror" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19.jpg" alt="light tiled bathroom with large mirror and shower glass for walk in shower area after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-35033 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p2">(<em>Above</em>) A Sweeten remodel for an <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-grandparents-renovate-kensington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accessible bathroom</a></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Figure out if a shower will work for you</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Before ordering materials and fixtures, <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post your project</a> on Sweeten and discuss with your contractor whether your desired shower size will fit in your space. </span><span class="s1">Create an overall plan that includes the finished size of the shower, location of existing or desired windows, lighting, exhaust fan, and the condition and location of existing plumbing. If the shower drain stays in the same location, the connection is simple and fast. If the drain must be moved, you’ll see the cost rise, depending on how extensive the work is. Items like the faucet and showerhead will come in later. </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Materials for converting a shower</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the shower unit itself, you can choose a good-quality pre-formed pan and walls, but high-quality tiled pans and walls have become prevalent and usually have a better “feel.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom tiles</a> are also one of, if not the most, powerful <span class="s3">aesthetic statements in the room</span>. This is where you can really get creative. Ceramic, glass, stone, and even metal tiles are available in any color, multiple textures, and finishes. You can truly have any look you love with tiles, and apart from normal cleaning and sealing, their maintenance is low.</span></p>
<h3>Costs to convert a bathtub to a shower</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Costs to convert a bathtub into a shower are usually quite reasonable. If you’re starting with a bathroom that’s in good condition, you can plan for $1,500 or so for a quick and basic conversion. If you upgrade to a tile pan and walls, you’ll be looking at $3,000 and up. These figures are for standard materials. However, when you make changes to the room size, or add windows that require new framing, your costs will increase. </span></p>

<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Megan + Zak&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/carnegie-hill-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk-in shower</a> remodel</p>
<h4>Costs for faucets and showerheads</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Faucets and showerheads are available in countless styles and finishes, and you’re probably aware of rainfall showerheads. Full-body jets are another popular and luxurious feature, but definitely are considered an extra. Good faucets will cost $100 and up and they’re worth every penny.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One item you mustn’t overlook is the shower door system. You’ll find clear glass, frosted glass, and so on, but the aesthetics are less important than the quality. Like the shower pan, the door keeps the water where it belongs and should seal completely. A tiny leak, unnoticed for five years, is a disaster in the making. Fortunately, you can prevent this scenario easily with a high-quality door system installed by your contractor. A good unit will cost you $500 and up, depending on the size you need.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">A remodeling team to guide your bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just like kitchens, bathroom remodels can be more complex than other rooms. This is due to their heavy, daily usage and the requirement for more fixtures in a small space. Toilet, sink, shower, and storage all have to be integrated into one of the smallest rooms in the house. That’s where interior designers and general contractors shine. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find the right general contractor</a> to help you navigate these decisions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><i>A note on fixture and appliance deliveries</i>: If you’re on a tight timeline, <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100545793-15162279"><span class="s1">Appliances Connection</span></a> has over 50,000 items in stock and ready to ship nationally. If you’re in the NY/NJ metro area, in-stock items typically deliver within 2-3 days.</p>

			<h2>Yes, revised estimates are possible, but be ready to compromise and collaborate</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="living-room-with-doors" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision.jpg" alt="Living room with doors and room view before renovation" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51371" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you’ve received a remodeling estimate from your Sweeten general contractor. What if the total exceeds your budget—can you ask for a revised estimate?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short answer: Yes, with limitations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>When can I ask for a lower or revised renovation estimate?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can generally expect a single round of minor revisions for free. If you need major scope changes or multiple versions of the estimate, expect your contractor to ask for money up-front. This is because calculating estimates requires substantial work. If you hire the contractor, this fee will typically be treated as a deposit and will count toward the total renovation cost. You won’t be out-of-pocket unless you ask a contractor for extensive revisions and then decline to hire them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What revisions are considered minor? Minor revisions involve eliminating part of the project or making simple substitutions (switching from custom imported tiles to standard subway tiles, etc.).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you negotiate for a lower price, you must always think in terms of reduced scope or lower-priced materials. Don’t just ask for a discount! General contractors don’t leave room for discounts in their estimates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely ask your contractor for advice on how to meet a lower budget. Their experience can be invaluable in strategizing where to cut costs<span>—</span>and where not to. </span></p>
<h3>Ballpark quote vs. formal remodeling estimate</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind the difference between a contractor’s initial ballpark quote and their formal estimate. That first quote may be based on your posted Sweeten project and a brief conversation. The formal estimate will come after a site visit, a longer discussion, and hours of behind-the-scenes research and calculation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you receive your initial quote, this is the time to discuss your budget limits and to be clear about your must-haves vs. your nice-to-haves. Giving your <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor the important information up-front</a> will help you avoid major revisions entirely.</span></p>
<h3>Do:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discuss your scope and budget with your contractor before they draft an estimate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After your site visit, feel free to postpone requesting an estimate. If you need time to think about your budget, ask for it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask your contractor for advice on reducing the scope to meet your budget</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect to pay for major estimate revisions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect to wait a few days for major estimate revisions</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Don’t:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask for a discount without a change in scope or materials</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask for a formal estimate before you’re clear on your budget</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect major revisions for free</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect major revisions quickly</span></li>
</ul>

			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Considering laminate wood flooring for your home? The benefits abound, from costs and style to durability</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="brown-laminate-wood-flooring" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide.jpg" alt="Brown laminate wood flooring with beige bench and side stool" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-51403 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With lumber prices skyrocketing, many homeowners are rethinking their material choices for renovations. One alternative to hardwood flooring, that deserves a second look, is laminate that looks like wood. Although lumber prices are starting to drop back to normal levels, Sweeten lays out what the benefits are beyond price alone to choosing laminate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is laminate flooring?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Lamination is a process of uniting layers of material by an adhesive (or other means.) Laminate wood flooring is just that–it is three material layers pressed together, using heat, to create a strong product. The base layer of laminate flooring is wood particleboard, followed by a layer with a wood image, known as the design layer. Over top is a protective transparent wear layer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It is easy to confuse laminate wood flooring with vinyl wood flooring. The main difference is their composition: laminate is 99% wood product, and vinyl wood flooring is all plastic.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Pros and cons of laminate wood flooring</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As with everything, there are tradeoffs when choosing one material over another. However, laminate flooring has a lot going for it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">Pros:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">Less expensive than hardwoods</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Durable: kid- and pet-friendly</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Comes in many styles and color options</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Is easy to install as a DIY project</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Can last from 10 to 25 years, depending on quality, care, and amount of use</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Generally eco-friendly: Made of post-consumer wood products; no need for glues or adhesives in installation; can be removed and re-used; can be recycled </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">Cons:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">Unlike solid hardwood flooring, laminate can’t be refinished when it begins to show signs of wear</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">It&#8217;s not 100% waterproof (not recommended for kitchens, bathrooms, or over cement slabs, as in basements)</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Difficult to repair</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Features of laminate wood flooring</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring has been around for more than 40 years. Over that time, manufacturers have improved on both the product’s performance and style. Today, there seem to be endless variations of the types of laminate available. Here are some of the features to keep in mind when choosing the right kind of laminate floors for your renovation.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Style and design</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Because laminate flooring is manufactured, the sky’s the limit on styles. With advances in technology, laminate wood flooring can very closely imitate the look and feel of real hardwoods. Today’s laminate includes grooves and ridges in the texture that create a natural-looking character. Boards come in all sizes: short, long, thin, or wide-plank. Want that hand-scraped wood look? No problem. Working on a coastal look? Laminate comes in gray and white-washed stains. You can choose your look by color variation, wood species, style theme, and size.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Underlayment</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring is installed as a floating floor. As a part of proper installation, a separate underlayment is required. The <a href="https://www.builddirect.com/learning-center/flooring/laminate-flooring-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s8">type of underlayment</span></a> varies depending on the subfloor. However, some laminate wood flooring products come with attached underlayment. In this case, a separate underlayment is not necessary. Pay attention when you buy as to whether or not your planks already come with or without this feature.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Waterproof</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">No laminate wood flooring is truly waterproof; for that, look to vinyl wood flooring. Despite this, you will see laminate wood flooring on the market, advertised as being waterproof. This tends to mean it is “spillproof.” Read the warranty closely. In the case where water gets under the flooring, either due to standing water under an appliance or installation over a previous cement slab, the wood material can still be damaged.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Noise resistance</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Some laminate manufacturers market features to reduce sound transmission underfoot. This can include attached backings, or the option to pair the flooring with a specific additional underlayment pad. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Use with radiant floor heating</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Radiant heating is a type of in-floor heating system that goes below the floor covering. Just as some solid wood species are better than others for use with radiant heating, the same goes for laminate. There are laminate wood flooring products designed for use with radiant heating. Discuss with your contractor what humidity levels you need to maintain to avoid gapping between the boards. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Durability rating</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring is known for being durable. Just how durable? Check <a href="https://www.builddirect.com/learning-center/flooring/laminate-flooring-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s8">its AC rating</span></a>. Short for Abrasion Criteria, the rating ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most durable. AC1 is suitable for low-traffic areas. For residential uses, AC3 or AC4 is generally advised for high-traffic rooms.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring cost vs. hardwood</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Obviously, solid hardwood flooring comes from planks milled from real trees. And that explains why, generally speaking, solid hardwood floors cost more than laminate flooring. The price is tied to factors such as weather, the rareness of wood, <span class="s8">and export costs</span>. Conversely, laminate wood flooring costs are based on its quality and style features: thickness; durability of wear layer; and presence of underlayment.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While laminate overall is less expensive than hardwoods, high-end laminate wood may cost more per square foot than low-end hardwoods. When choosing your laminate flooring, think about your durability needs, in addition to the other features we covered. (And, keep in mind, there are other variables to consider overall <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s9">when choosing a flooring material!)</span></a></span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much does hardwood flooring cost?</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/how-much-does-flooring-cost/"><span class="s9">Forbes</span></a>, hardwood flooring costs can average from $3–$12 a square foot. Add to that $26 (or higher) for 500 square feet of the required underlayment. Labor costs for hardwood flooring installation add an extra $3–$9 a square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The type of wood you choose affects the cost. <span class="s9">For example</span>, an exotic hardwood, like Brazilian walnut, can range from $8–$14 a square foot. A softer, more plentiful wood, such as pine, averages from $3–$6 a square foot. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Adding together materials and labor averages, total hardwood flooring costs can range between $6–$21 a square foot. For perspective, costs to install real hardwood flooring in a 500-square-foot area would be between $3,000–$10,500.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much does laminate flooring cost?</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s10">Most laminate flooring comes with an interlocking tongue-and-groove system. </span><span class="s1">Being a very DIY-friendly option, it’s helpful to focus on material costs alone. Laminate flooring can be purchased for as low as $0.59 a square foot, and can range upwards of $6 a square foot. Purchasing laminate with an attached underlayment will cost you more up-front, but will save on labor later.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s11">Breaking <span class="s12">this down further, laminate</span></span><span class="s2"> with a thin wear layer is available for as low as under $1 a square foot. Medium-quality laminate ranges from $2–$4, and high-quality sells for $3–$5+ a square foot.</span></p>
<h4>How much does it cost to install laminate wood flooring?</h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">If you’d rather have a pro install your laminate wood flooring, labor costs average between $1–$3 a square foot. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Altogether with materials and labor combined, laminate floors can cost as low as $1.59 and as high as $9 a square foot. That means it would cost between $795 and $4,500 to install laminate wood flooring in a 500-square-foot area.</span></p>
<h5>Choosing laminate floors for your home</h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The advances in laminate flooring technology over the past several decades have made a once-eschewed flooring material a strong contender to hardwoods. With its lower cost, durability, eco-friendliness, and wide range of style options, more people today are happily picking laminate hardwood flooring for their homes.</span></p>

			<h2 class="p1">Creating an ADU in Chicago is possible with existing structures or building new</h2>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" title="white-open-kitchen-in-an-adu" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Chicago-ADU-Cover.jpg" alt="White open kitchen overlooking the living area in an ADU after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51232" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Chicago-ADU-Cover.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Chicago-ADU-Cover-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Chicago-ADU-Cover-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Thanks to a decision by the City Council, accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, are now allowed in five areas of the city of Chicago. The new <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/doh/provdrs/homeowners/svcs/adu-ordinance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Chicago ADU pilot program</span></a> removes the ADU ban in place since 1957. The benefits of Chicago ADUs include creating more affordable housing units while providing income for homeowners. They also offer space for family members at different life stages, also known as multi-generational housing. In this guide, we review how<span> to build ADUs in Chicago</span> and how they could be an asset for homeowners.</p>
<h3 class="p1">What are ADUs?</h3>
<p class="p1">An ADU is not one type of structure, but a variety of types. They can be unattached, as with a carriage house located in the alley or at the back of the lot. They can also be new construction in an existing space in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main residence</a> on the property. Chicago’s ordinance calls these “conversion units.”</p>
<p class="p1">A crucial consideration is the planned use of the unit. If the plan is for rentable living space (thus the term “dwelling unit”), it will need a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen</a> and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. These are the most expensive spaces per square foot, with toilets, sinks, and electrical.</p>
<p class="p1">An ADU without a kitchen or bathroom could be a home office, studio, or a personal retreat outside of the main residence. These are simpler and cheaper than living space, as they’re not dwelling spaces. An ADU, by definition, will also have a separate entrance from the main home, even if attached to or part of the main home.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Why were Chicago ADUs banned?</h3>
<p class="p1">Restrictions on ADUs in Chicago often followed complaints from homeowners who wanted to prevent “undesirable” change in their neighborhoods. Overcrowding and parking issues are still cited, but a nationwide housing crunch has affected many Americans. As a result, more homeowners want a rental unit on their property for income. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/grannie-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Multi-generational housing</span></a> is also seen as an efficient solution financially and for caregiving. More city governments view ADUs as a way to alleviate a very tight housing market.</p>
<h3 class="p1">How to get a legal Chicago ADU on your property</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Renovate an existing building into an ADU</h4>
<p class="p1">First, is an ADU <span class="s1">legally allowed</span> on your property? If so, do you have an <span class="s2">existing building? </span>Some remodels to consider include a granny flat or in-law space or rental.</p>
<p class="p1">If there’s existing space, what is it currently used for? Is it a good candidate for renovation for housing? Some older buildings would require a good deal of renovation work that it would be cheaper and faster to remove and replace. A crumbling foundation is a good example of this type of hurdle.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Build a new Chicago ADU</h4>
<p class="p1">Does your lot have sufficient space for <span class="s2">new construction</span>? New space that’s attached to or part of the existing home can involve some complex planning. For example, consider the interface between new electrical, plumbing, foundation, roof, and the existing components. Fortunately, that can all be figured out but requires careful planning.</p>
<p class="p1">When you&#8217;re ready to consider either type of project, it’s wise to consult with a licensed <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/chicago-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor in Chicago</a> who has experience with these complexities. <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> can help connect you with local contracting firms in your area. Whatever one you build will have to meet all applicable codes. In other words, you don’t get a free pass on anything. The exception is the parking minimum. The pilot program doesn’t require new parking for an ADU. The benefits: new useful space; may increase your property value; and you’ll have a legal, income-producing space.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Chicago ADU pilot program</h3>
<p class="p1">Chicago’s ADU pilot program delineates some regulations by area. For example, under the Chicago ADU pilot program, you cannot remove existing parking to make way for ADUs. Additionally, some areas are limited to two ADU permits per block per year. Some properties are required to meet affordable housing requirements with rent restrictions. Coach houses are limited to a maximum of 700 square feet and a height of 22 feet above grade.</p>
<p class="p1">You might be able to build more than one ADU, as well. Here’s what the program says:</p>
<p class="p5">“The number of ADUs allowed depends on the number of existing legal units on a property:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5">For properties with 1 to 4 units, the property owner can add one coach house unit to any property, or one conversion unit to properties that are at least 20 years old</li>
<li class="li5">For properties with 5 or more units, coach houses are not permitted, but the property owner can create up to 33 percent more units as conversion units.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">Short-term rentals</h3>
<p class="p1">That brings us to “short-term rentals,” Airbnb, or VRBO. In some locales, ADUs are a flashpoint, as owners can make substantially more money from vacation rentals than traditional rentals. As a result, homeowners with ADUs are switching to short-term rentals. This has caused the supply of traditional rentals to plummet, and that’s led to many restrictions on the number of short-term rentals permitted. Since this is a local issue, you’ll want to do your own research to see what’s happening where you live. At this point, Chicago’s ADU pilot program specifically prohibits short-term rentals permitted under the pilot program.</p>
<h3 class="p1">How much does an ADU cost?</h3>
<p class="p1">A major factor on the cost of a Chicago ADU will be based on what you have to work with. For example, are you <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">converting a garage</a> with a good roof that is close to electrical and plumbing hookups? Do you have an already empty space available, or need to remove trees to make space?</p>
<p class="p1">These factors make ADUs more complex than you realize, considering they tend to be small spaces. In fact, in places where they’re legally allowed the maximum square footage is usually limited to a fixed percentage of the square footage of the main house, as mentioned above.</p>
<p class="p1">Again, the cost will depend on multiple things: your existing property, the general <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor you hire</a>, plus options like hiring an architect. Your best bet is to work with an experienced professional to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build your new Chicago ADU</a>.</p>

<p>Competitive bidding means inviting three to five general contractors to submit an estimate, or bid, for your remodeling project. Then, after carefully comparing the bids, you can hire the right contractor with confidence.</p>
<p>This is standard practice in the wider world of construction. At Sweeten, our roots are in the construction industry—our founders are trained architects—and we believe competitive bidding is the ideal approach to planning home renovations. We suggest you ask for bids from at least 3 general contractors before hiring one. When it comes to getting estimates for your remodel, having multiple options gives you more flexibility and choice.</p>
<p>Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Competitive bidding empowers you to:</h3>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Know you’re getting <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/qa-with-jean-should-i-take-the-lowest-bid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a highly competitive price</a></li>
<li aria-level="1">Know you’re getting the specific services you need</li>
<li aria-level="1">Compare contractors’ design ideas and solutions</li>
<li aria-level="1">Compare contractors’ communication styles and personalities</li>
</ol>
<p>You’ll feel assured that you’ve chosen the right contractor, that you’re getting the right services, and that you’ve been quoted the right price. It’s a magical way to find peace of mind, without any second-guessing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Get an edge by installing connected smart home technology during your home remodel</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48936 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech.jpg" alt="Image of smart home technology in a shower" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart home technology is everywhere today. It has made its way into our vehicles, our workplaces, and our pockets. With smart tech’s skill at automation, it’s no surprise that it has found a perfect place in the home. Nearly<a href="https://cta.tech/Resources/i3-Magazine/i3-Issues/2020/January-February/The-Ringing-Future-of-Smart-Home-Technology"> <span class="s2">70-percent of homes</span></a> already own some type of smart home tech. And that number is only growing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some forms of smart home tech are more permanent. Sweeten outlines which ones can best be incorporated during a home remodel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart water heaters and controllers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Far from being smart, the average water heater is more like a blunt tool. It maintains hot water even when you don’t need hot water. Or if you turned it down before a vacation, you’ll need to manually turn it back up when you return. It can take hours for the water to heat up again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart water heaters connect to your home’s internet through Wi-Fi. This gives you remote access to all of the water heater’s functions. You can adjust temperature and set schedules. You can even monitor the status and shut it down if there’s a problem. This gives you a chance to call in a technician and avert disastrous water leaks.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart electrochromic (self-tinting) glass windows</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you live in a sunny climate, you know the constant routine of lowering and raising blinds to control inside temperatures. Even northern zones experience peak sunny periods during the summer.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Self-tinting glass darkens or lightens automatically in response to solar changes throughout the day. No blinds are required and nothing physically moves. While the windows require power for this operation, the amount of power is minimal. For 2,000 square feet of glass, the electricity required would only power a 60V-watt light bulb.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Self-tinting glass is truly cutting-edge smart home technology. It is still not widely available. But it is worth looking into if you live in places with heavy solar and heat demands.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart connected appliances</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Do all of your home’s separate appliances work as one? Probably not. Likely, they perform their own duties separately. A new and smarter option is to consider them as components of a larger system. According to<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/smart_home_tips"> <span class="s2">EnergyStar</span></a>, appliances with connected functionality use less energy than conventional appliances. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a two-part system. One, you’ll need to purchase smart appliances with that next big remodeling project. That includes refrigerators, freezers, washers and dryers, and dishwashers. Two, you’ll need a unifying management system that can recognize and operate those appliances. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EnergyStar’s SHEMS program is one program that is available for free. Google Home is another popular program that acts as a hub for an ever-growing number of smart devices.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart home security systems</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a long time, “smart” was the missing link of home security systems. Home alarms would report to an off-site monitoring center. From there, a call would be placed to local police and to the homeowner. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But smart security systems put homeowners front-and-center and keep them informed. That information is dually shared with the monitoring center and homeowner in real-time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While wireless security systems are popular, wired systems do have strong points. Cameras with wires running through attics or behind walls are difficult to tamper with. A hidden or locked-up digital video recorder (DVR) records hundreds or thousands of hours. Wireless cameras with SD cards record a few hours before rolling over and erasing.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart radiant wall heating</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On cold nights, hot air gushing from the central heating system’s vents is a welcome feeling. But if you were to watch with a thermal imaging camera, you’d see just how inefficient this is. Orange and yellow areas of warm air build up in some areas. Blue and green spots indicate places where the heat does not reach.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Large radiant heating panels mounted on the walls evenly distribute the warm air. A thermostat notices that the room is cold. It signals to a smart controller located in a separate area. That signal is relayed to a manifold, which sends hot water from a boiler to the radiant heating panels.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart water monitors</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your home may already have a smart water meter on the street. Installed by the water company, this meter reports the level of your usage wirelessly to the company. This is what generates your monthly bill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can install a similar device that you own and control. A licensed plumber splices the smart water monitor (not meter) into your home’s water supply line. The monitor communicates with your home’s Wi-Fi system. With an app, you can track your water consumption and can make adjustments to save water.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most importantly, a smart water monitor can sense unusual fluctuations in the water flow. These fluctuations may indicate a break in one of the pipes. Since the monitor is located at the start of the pipes, it can shut down all water to the house. This can stop devastating water line breaks before they happen.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart garage door openers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Garage doors remote controls are helpful, but they have a very limited radius. With a smartphone, you can control a smart garage door from anywhere you have a cell phone connection. You might be halfway to work and you think that you forgot to close the door. With the app, you can verify whether you did. If so, you can shut it remotely. Or you might need to open the garage door because a neighbor wants to borrow your mower. Smart garage doors expand the reach of the old remote control.</span></p>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is here to stay but choosing a few or even just one device or smart home technology system can offer a convenient way to stay on top of the inner mechanics of your home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>COVID-19 brings opportunities if you want to remodel your home, but you’ll need to know how to navigate</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48721 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4.jpg" alt="Image of a room in the middle of painting" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>When the global pandemic of 2020 hit, few homeowners were thinking about home remodeling. Yet as the pandemic wore on, life returned to (some) idea of normal and home remodeling once again became a topic. It was top of mind for homeowners who had already started a remodel before COVID-19 spread. Homeowners who had only considered remodeling also started to plan their projects in earnest.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to remodeling, COVID-19 has impacted material costs and changed the supply chain. Sweeten outlines what a homeowner might expect to encounter while taking on a remodel during COVID-19, and how to navigate those obstacles to get your renovation plans back on track.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>We&#8217;re noticing our homes in new ways, every day</h3>
<p>Homeowners now spend more time than ever at home. Flaws that were merely annoying with that bathroom or kitchen are now magnified. Homeowners who only wondered if their home was ready for a remodel now know.</p>
<p>This need isn’t just imaginary, either. More people at home means that renovation is a necessity. Even if only a couple of people live there, everything in the house is being used more often.</p>
<h3>Savings from 2020 allow for renovations in 2021</h3>
<p>The pandemic has hit many people hard—the job market, businesses, people’s health. Some homeowners have been lucky, and employers have found ways to keep workers employed from home.</p>
<p>However, there is a rare upside to the COVID-19 pandemic for some Americans. Many homeowners’ expenses have shrunk dramatically. What has contributed to this? With less driving, gas and vehicle expenses drop. Less dining out and entertaining means lighter credit card bills. Vacation plans have been canceled.</p>
<p>This has caught many experts by surprise, too. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies had previously predicted a slowdown in home remodeling in 2021. But as 2020 wore on, the group revised its prediction. They now<a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/home-remodeling-set-stronger-growth-2021"> indicate that home remodeling</a> is going stronger than ever, with a projected uptick in home renovation and repair spending from 2020 to 2021.</p>
<p>Indeed, at Sweeten, we saw an increase in home renovation projects. Our fourth quarter saw 110% growth year-over-year from 2019 to 2020. The trend is continuing into 2021 as well, with 99% growth for January 2021 vs. 2020. We attribute this growth to homeowners realizing their homes need to be so much more than a place to just sleep. More than ever, we&#8217;ve needed our homes to provide us space for work, play, self-care, and recovery.</p>
<h3>Act fast, or prepare to wait for building materials</h3>
<p>Homeowners intent on remodeling may find themselves blocked due to a severe slowdown in the supply of materials. In many sectors, the manufacturing of building materials drastically slowed or came to a complete stop. Even if manufacturers are functioning again, they are doing so at a reduced capacity due to social distancing.</p>
<p>The pandemic shows how much the U.S. depends on overseas building products like lumber, roofing, and windows. For one, many homes’ kitchen and bathroom remodels use ceramic and porcelain tile. However, over<a href="https://www.floorcoveringweekly.com/main/topnews/2019-us-ceramic-tile-market-update-29623"> 81% of U.S. tile</a> comes from China, Mexico, Spain, Italy, and Brazil. Both Spain and Italy were hard hit particularly by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Home centers are ordering up to 300% more product due to the high level of DIY home repairs and remodels. This has a significant impact on the supply chain for builders.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Don&#8217;t wait! For homeowners interested in renovating, it&#8217;s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up.</p>
<h3>Labor lag-time is a reality</h3>
<p>Soon after the pandemic hit, over<a href="https://www.agc.org/sites/default/files/Files/Communications/Recap_Current_Construction_Business_Conditions_Final.pdf"> 25% of building projects</a> came to an immediate halt or were delayed, according to an industry group. For any homeowner thinking of a remodel, this means that all other projects in the queue must come first.</p>
<p>Even materials that are acquired and on-site do no good unless there are workers to install them. Workers who have had to tend to family members affected by COVID-19 have left the workforce or even the U.S. At the same time, other workers who are eager to work have filled in the vacuum.</p>
<h3>Tips on handling your COVID-19 remodel project</h3>
<p>The future is unclear, but one thing is certain: COVID-19’s effects are long-lasting. Even after vaccines are widely dispensed, there will be an effect in building and remodeling. Here&#8217;s what proactive homeowners can do to position themselves well for a remodel during COVID-19 recovery.</p>
<h4>Book a contractor now</h4>
<p>The desire to remodel has increased, and in many markets, demand outstrips supply. If you delay speaking to a contractor, you’ll have<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/16/what-you-can-do-now-plan-manage-home-renovation-once-conditions-are-right/?arc404=true"> even more orders</a> jump into the line ahead of you. With vaccines being widely distributed, there will only be more people booking a contractor. Begin setting up appointments to meet general contractors for site visits.</p>
<h4>Conduct virtual site-visits</h4>
<p>Sweeten offers a streaming video conference on the platform. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-renovate-safely-with-a-virtual-site-visit/">virtual site visit replaces</a> both the general contractor’s walk-through of the property and the face-to-face conference between contractor and homeowner.</p>
<p>If done effectively, it can give the contractor enough information to begin drawing up an estimate. This allows for both parties to safely review the renovation project virtually, without meeting in person.</p>
<p>Take note: a physical site visit will need to be done at some point for the contractor to take their own measurements and account for every detail. Virtual site visits are a good option, however, if an initial in-person site visit isn’t possible or safe.</p>
<h4>Expect higher costs, but shop smartly for savings</h4>
<p>Some<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/always-expect-home-remodeling-to-cost-50-percent-more-take-50-percent-longer-finance-expert.html"> experts predict</a> that home remodeling not only will take longer but will cost up to 50% more than in pre-pandemic times. Don&#8217;t worry: this gives motivated homeowners the chance to shop for items on their own. Make sure to seek the best possible prices out there, and select your contractor carefully.</p>
<h4>Make the most of your space with clever design</h4>
<p>Speaking early on to a general contractor or designer will help you solidify your ideas. Hone your design with care and avoid waste.</p>
<p>The transformation of under-utilized spaces is a trend here to stay. Basements, attics, or garages are performing in new ways. At Sweeten, we&#8217;re seeing attics turn into places for children to learn and play. Basements are mostly getting turned into gyms. Garages are becoming studios or offices that could be rented out in the future.</p>
<p>With multiple family members at home during the day, the installation of glass panels has gained traction. People aren’t looking for visual separation—they need acoustic separation when working from home.</p>
<p>Outdoor spaces and outdoor kitchens will be popular. It’s unknown if we’ll still be social distancing through the summer. Being able to host the whole event outside, not having to run back and forth inside, makes the event a better experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>During COVID-19, certain renovation projects became even more important for homeowners</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44610 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4.jpg" alt="Image of the interior of a renovated Hamptons ranch home" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) A Sweeten homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/southampton-home-renovation-transforms-garage-into-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #76808f;">turns the garage into a living room</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic forced us to take a hard look at our homes. Many were grateful for the security and comfort our homes offered. But many more made note of the features that their homes lacked. At a time when almost half of the workforce was working from home and schools relied on distance learning, renovation projects became top of mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the renovation mindset may be a little different going forward. Jean Brownhill, the founder and CEO of Sweeten discussed the current state of renovation on <em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sweeten-founder-jean-brownhill-on-new-rules-renovation/id1520457603?i=1000504585856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Time</a>,</em> a podcast hosted by <em>Domino</em> editor-in-chief Jessica Romm Perez. One trend they discussed is the emergence of practicality and functionality.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone&#8217;s goal is to make their finished project picture perfect. But to actually live in the space, other things may be more important. Here are some top projects Sweeten saw grow in popularity over the last year.</span></p>
<h3>Top COVID-19 renovation projects</h3>
<h4>Creating new living areas</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With people spending so much time at home, they adapted their living spaces to new uses. Many people upgraded their outdoor living areas by adding outdoor kitchens and other living spaces. Also, it wasn&#8217;t clear if a vacation away would be possible, so outdoor living space became more important. It also makes it possible to socialize with others if indoor entertaining isn’t an option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because health clubs and gyms were closed, many people looked for ways to squeeze a workout space into their living areas. People <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-modern-basement-renovation-produces-a-clean-slate-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adapted spare rooms or unfinished areas</a> like basements to create home gyms. </span></p>
<h4>Kitchen and bathroom remodels still in the spotlight</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchen and bathroom renovations are still popular. Although kitchens have always had many uses, their multitasking ability became more important during the pandemic. Kids often did their remote learning there, and adults used them for makeshift home offices. That&#8217;s in addition to the regular cooking, eating, and cleaning that goes on in a kitchen. The National Kitchen and Bath Association reports that in addition to upgraded appliances, there was an increase in requests for easy-to-clean surfaces, video watching ability, and device charging stations in the cook space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bathrooms became personal sanctuaries more than ever before. After a few weeks that turned into months into the pandemic, people came to value self-care more than ever. Even those who had not considered bath renovations undertook them to improve on their self-care routine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some bath update trends include oversized showers that feature multiple spray heads and body sprays, as well as a steam option. Voice commands can activate preset water temperatures and start music from a personal playlist. Ventilation fans do more than removing moisture: some have LED lighting that helps prevent mold growth. Others feature multi-color lights to change the mood of the room. Many spa-like features can be controlled by smartphones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that most renovations had in common was ease of maintenance. You can renovate a space that looks great, but you have to live in it. &#8220;I think that is one reason why porcelain tiles and planks are so popular,&#8221; said Jean. &#8220;They are easy to clean and they can be made to look like any material. &#8220;</span></p>
<h4>Reworking existing spaces</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, we can relate to how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our work habits. The typical household can get hectic with everyone vying for counter space where they can work, as well as computer time. The problem was frequently solved by setting up work and play areas throughout the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jean mentioned the trend of installing temporary glass panels in the home. These solve the noise problem that happens when someone is on a video call while someone else is unloading the dishwasher, other people are having a conversation, and kids are running around playing. Panels and interior windows give people acoustic separation. &#8220;We’re not looking for visual separation, but what we do want, and need, is acoustic separation,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A closet organizing system that lets you store things neatly and efficiently may be of more use than a room straight out of the pages of a magazine. &#8220;As someone doing a renovation, you don&#8217;t rise to the level of your goals so much as you fall to the level of the systems you put in place,&#8221; said Jean. While we usually want our homes to look fashionable, the emphasis for homes was on function for 2020. </span></p>
<h4>Using unused space</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As floor plans were reconfigured, any unused or underutilized areas became prime real estate. Guest bedrooms became home offices or study lounges. But the real stars were spaces like basements, attics, and garages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attics became playrooms for children. Basements were also used as play areas, but many were converted to home gyms. Some drywall and flooring, and maybe a little weatherproofing, turned these storage areas into useful living spaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some places, such as Los Angeles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people are adding ADUs</a>. An ADU is short for accessory dwelling unit. It is a new living space added to an existing building. Garages are being converted to home offices, but also studio apartments. The apartments can be rented out in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic presents new reasons to think creatively about our living spaces. Although we hope the pandemic will stay a once-in-a-lifetime event, we can all take cues from these COVID-19 renovation projects to inspire our own spaces at home.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom Reber, founder of The Contractor Fight, reveals why stats and client trust are important</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47553" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1.jpg" alt="Tom Raber Contractor Fight" width="2000" height="1334" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When owning your own contracting business, day-to-day questions or larger issues will come up where answers are uncertain or the path forward isn’t clear. A contracting community as a sounding board can be helpful in your goal to keep your business moving and growing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this second of two blog posts, <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> gets advice from Tom Reber, founder of <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">The Contractor Fight</span></a>, on what stats to focus on, what he tells his coaching groups to initiate change, and how to sell for a higher profit. You can also hear more on his podcasts. <span style="color: #333333;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-do-i-grow-my-general-contracting-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to read Part 1</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten matches general contractors</a> with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are the most important stats for contractors when they’re looking to grow their business? </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First off, don’t be intimidated by the numbers—it is just scorekeeping. Think of it like fantasy football stats &#8211; you need to run the plays that get the most yardage. Using data will help you make better decisions. Like fantasy football or baseball, work on your “stats” weekly and be objective. How many times did the phone ring? Where did your leads come from? What was the size of the job? How much did you spend to get that lead? What is the close rate of all the leads from that source, how many closed?</span></p>
<p>The numbers tell you where to focus. Don’t shy away from them.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><em>Note:</em> Tom discusses more about stats on <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">his podcast.</span></a> You can also <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/general-contractor-performance-stats-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">monitor how your business is doing</span></a> when you are part of the Sweeten network.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are the top three things you encourage GCs to start doing when they join your program?</span></h3>
<h4><span class="s1">1. Engage with a like-minded community</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It may sound remedial but, first and foremost, I encourage general contractors to join our online community. The first step is to get engaged—don’t be a wallflower. It is like joining a gym, and then not going—that won’t get you any closer to your goals. Get in, ask questions, engage, be present. This is a like-minded community, so share your story and listen to the stories of others. If you follow the system, it will work for you. </span></p>
<h4><span class="s1">2. Define the first problem</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Get clarity around the very first issue you want to fix. You need to define that first problem. Focus on one issue and go all-in on that. Use the frameworks provided to double down and knock down that first domino. You have to dedicate time and energy to the problem, which means you won’t be able to fix everything at once.</span></p>
<h4>3. Focus on your first problem every day</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Once you have defined that first domino, build consistent habits around tackling that problem, so it always stays top of mind. Then create a checklist of three things and do it every day. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are the most important things to do when looking to start selling jobs with a higher profit? </span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Take a hard look at your numbers</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">First off, you need to give yourself a reality check (via the job-costing exercise). At least 75% of general contractors do not know or understand their own numbers. In my program, when we take them through their numbers, it is an eye-opening experience. It&#8217;s possible to sell jobs with a 50% profit. It doesn&#8217;t sound possible but it can be done.</span></p>
<h4>Sharpen your communication skills</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Get your sales process in order. How you communicate with a prospective client makes a huge difference. Most contractors think it is about the scope of work or price, but it is absolutely about human connection and understanding the homeowner’s motives. Practice by role-playing with the online community. Oh, and listen when people talk; don’t just think about what you plan to say next!</span></p>
<h4>How to build trust with clients</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lastly, “mind the gap”—this is the time between the sale and the work being done. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Don’t go silent:</strong><span class="s3"> Continue to add value during this time by educating them so they feel great about their decision to hire you. This builds trust and makes it a great experience.  </span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Do what you say you will when you promise to do it:</strong><span class="s3"> Being trustworthy and having integrity is critical to this business and being able to charge higher prices. </span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Don’t blame customers for being cheap: </strong><span class="s3">Ask yourself first “have I done everything I can to make sure this customer feels heard?”</span><span class="s1"><i><br />
</i></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When owning your own contracting business, day-to-day questions or larger issues will come up where answers are uncertain or the path forward isn’t clear. A contracting community as a sounding board can be helpful in your goal to keep your business moving and growing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this first of two blog posts, <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> talks with Tom Reber, founder of <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/"><span class="s2">The Contractor Fight</span></a>. Tom explains how to start job-costing, discussing profit and overhead with clients, and common issues that general contractors are facing within his coaching groups. You can also check out <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/category/the-contractor-fight-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his podcast</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten matches general contractors</a> </span><span class="s1">with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is the easiest way to start job-costing?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> A lot of general contractors overcomplicate this. It is as simple as doing the math on a regular basis. Ask yourself, “What am I spending per day to do this job?” “How many guys worked today, and what did I pay them?” “What did we spend at Home Depot?” Most people are just afraid to do the math, but if you do it daily or even weekly, it can be a lot less overwhelming.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How do you recommend GCs discuss profit and overhead with clients? </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> On occasion, a customer might ask, “How much profit do you make?” I typically respond with “That is a great question! We make X, which allows us to attract top talent, pay good salaries, benefits, and allows us to honor warranties.” Don’t skirt the question or get defensive—answering honestly and openly shows that you are transparent, run a tight shop, and have integrity.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s3">What are the most common issues facing GCs in your coaching groups? What do you recommend to address these issues? </span></h3>
<h4>Problem: Limited access to new ideas</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> Hands down, the number one issue is just looking at the symptom, like not making enough money or poor employee retention, and not figuring out the root cause. This problem is caused by how you think &#8211; they [contractors] get advice from their other unsuccessful contractor buddies, which continues to limit their thinking. </span></p>
<h4>Solution: Expand your network</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> You are the average of the five people you spend time with. Make sure you surround yourself with people who can help you, rather than hold you back. </span><span class="s1">By joining our group, you get access to different ways of thinking, including the Daily Challenge, which encourages you to test and learn. You will get comfortable with the uncomfortable—and <em>that</em> is when real change can happen.</span></p>
<h4>Problem: Not tackling the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right</span> issues</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> </span>The second biggest issue I see is a lack of clarity and consistency. As I mentioned in a previous answer, you need to get clarity on your biggest issues and then consistently attack it. You dug this hole over time, so don’t expect it to be solved overnight! You need to have grit and stick with those good daily habits that lead to progress.</p>
<h4>Solution: Focus on the numbers</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> </span>One of my favorite suggestions is to install KPI Fridays. This means dedicating some time at the end of the week to focus on your numbers, whether it be job costing or goal setting and tracking.

<h3>How to pay your general contractor during a renovation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/pay-safely-for-home-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Secure Pay</a></span><span class="s2"> lets you pay your home renovation deposit digitally, right from your Sweeten dashboard. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Until now, many contractors only accepted cash or paper checks, with all the associated inconveniences and delays—and complete lack of protections. Hiring and materials purchases would often be delayed until the check cleared.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Sweeten Secure pay links to your bank account or credit card. It lets your contractor know immediately when funds are on the way, and completes the transfer in 1–2 business days.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s2">Benefits of Secure Pay:</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s2">Pay for home renovations safely, with confidence. Transfers are handled by our trusted banking partners, Dwolla and Stripe—leaders in the financial industry. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Pay by credit card or bank transfer (ACH) </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Pay easily, right from your Sweeten dashboard </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Payments clear in 1–2 business days; your contractor sees instantly that funds are on the way. You can quickly make your hire official, and secure your place on the contractor’s calendar. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Your banking information stays private. Sweeten and your contractor can’t see or store any financial information. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></span></h3>
<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637075677893"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Why is Sweeten Secure Pay better than writing a check?</strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You get the convenience of paying for home renovations digitally and responding directly to your contractor’s deposit request. You&#8217;ll avoid delays, and can secure your place on the contractor’s schedule as quickly as possible. Receive a permanent record of your transaction alongside your other renovation information. And if you pay by credit card, you get all your card company’s perks.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637075732129"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Do all Sweeten general contractors accept deposits through Sweeten Secure Pay?</strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Sweeten Secure Pay is new; general contractors will have to set up their accounts before they can receive funds. Ask your contractor if they’re ready to receive Secure Pay deposits.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637075768647"><strong class="schema-faq-question">How do I sign up?</strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Go to the Secure Pay tab on your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/login/renovator">dashboard</a> and follow the simple instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637075792347"><strong class="schema-faq-question">How do I know when or how much to pay?</strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Your general contractor will send a deposit request, which will appear in your Sweeten dashboard. It should match what you and the contractor have already agreed on. If you have questions about the deposit request, you’ll have as much time as you need to discuss with your contractor. No funds will transfer until you explicitly approve the payment.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637075823777"><strong class="schema-faq-question">How will my bank account and personal information be protected?</strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Sweeten and your general contractor will never see your account information or social security number. We work with industry-leading 3rd party payment systems that are built around security and privacy. They use strong, end-to-end encryption for all transactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637075836164"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Do I have to keep funds in my Sweeten Payments account?</strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">No. We transfer the funds directly from your bank or credit card.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44973 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brownstone-Boys-Profile.jpg" alt="Brownstone Boys renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brownstone-Boys-Profile.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brownstone-Boys-Profile-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brownstone-Boys-Profile-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brownstone-Boys-Profile-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (Above) Jordan (<em>left</em>) and Barry (<em>right</em>) of the Brownstone Boys</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When the Brownstone Boys<span>— </span>Barry Bordelon and Jordan Slocum<span>— </span>began renovating their 130-year-old brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, they decided to document the journey. Their multi-story home seemingly squeezed in bedrooms wherever they could (five!), a kitchen sat in the middle of a living room, and the kitchen needed an upgrade. Ready for the deep-dive, the pair had original woodwork restored, overhauled the cooking space and modernized the home throughout. The room they&#8217;re most proud of? A bedroom-turned-guest-bath. &#8220;</span><span class="s1">We went classic New York all the way—subway tiles, hex floret floor tile, and claw foot tub,&#8221; the duo said. &#8220;We added a reclaimed door adding chicken-wire glass and stenciled &#8216;WC&#8217; into it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Brownstone Boys shared some do’s and don’ts with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a </span><span class="s1">free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects</span><span class="s1">. Read more about how the 15-year Brooklyn veterans transformed their home on their <a href="https://www.thebrownstoneboys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Brownstone Boys blog</span></a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Brownstone Boys: The &#8220;Do&#8217;s&#8221; of renovating:</span></h3>
<h4><span class="s4">1. Make sure you have the right team</span><span class="s1"> (contractor, architect, specialists)</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/VrQ4mS7dRo8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44984 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-PlasterMolding.jpg" alt="Brownstone Boys renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-PlasterMolding.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-PlasterMolding-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span class="s1">It’s one of the first things you’ll do. You’ll be spending a lot of time with these professionals. Make sure they understand the project, have the skills needed, have a good track record, and are easy to communicate with.</span></p>
<h4><span class="s4">2. Get together a solid budget and leave room for contingency</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/90TDAm-UtHE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44985 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-PocketDoors.jpg" alt="Brownstone Boys renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-PocketDoors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-PocketDoors-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span class="s1">Surprises can be waiting when you open up the walls. Decisions you make in the design phase can also impact the budget. Making large structural changes can require the need for a structural engineer. HVAC plans may call for a mechanical engineer. Be prepared to set your priorities and create a budget that leaves room for the inevitable surprises. Depending on the size of your renovation, leave about a 10-20% contingency.</span></p>
<h4><span class="s4">3. Get 3-5 estimates from contractors</span></h4>
<p><span class="s1">You’ll learn something with every walkthrough you have with a contractor. Quotes can vary greatly. Some contractors have crews of their own rather than subs for certain things which can lower costs. Some have more experience in areas that might especially help in your project. You could easily see some quotes come in double from others. Getting 3-5 estimates will help you understand the full range and put you in the best position to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">choose the bid that works for your project</a> the most. (Hint: that is often not the cheapest one).<br />
</span></p>
<h4><span class="s4">4. Plan on a lot of things taking longer than you expect</span><span class="s1"> </span></h4>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/hF68zFmWLyA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-44983 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-KitchenAfter.jpg" alt="Brownstone Boys renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-KitchenAfter.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-KitchenAfter-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-KitchenAfter-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Photo: Dave Sauerhoff</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">City approvals, landmarks approvals, plumbing inspections, finishes selection, and material delivery are all part of the process. Things along the way will also create delays. If you build in extra time, it will be much less stressful.</span></p>
<h4><span class="s7">5. Organize your inspiration photos so you have a good sense of what you want</span><b> </b></h4>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/B9fujQEGX5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-44982 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-GuestBath.jpg" alt="Brownstone Boys renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-GuestBath.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-GuestBath-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-GuestBath-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Photo: Dave Sauerhoff</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">For many people, going through a renovation will require making more decisions in a short period of time! It will take time and you’ll want to think about details and materials carefully. Start organizing your thoughts early so that you know what you want later.</span></p>
<h4><span class="s7">6. Have<b> at least weekly meetings with your contractor</b></span><span class="s1"><b> but remember they need their space to work </b></span></h4>
<p><span class="s1">Hopefully, you selected a contractor who is easy to communicate with and responsible enough to be given some autonomy. You likely won’t be on-site daily, but it’s a good idea to set a weekly walkthrough to review what has been done the previous week, what issues have come up, and what will be done over the following week. At the same time, it’s probably not the best idea to micromanage your contractor on a daily basis. You want them to work efficiently and you should be able to trust them to get the job done. If you don’t, then you might not have the right team.<br />
</span></p>
<h4><span class="s4">7. Order finishes with proper lead times and the right quantities</span></h4>
<p><span class="s1">Some finishes have longer lead times than others. If you don’t have enough of that custom tile to finish your bathroom, you might have a 6-8 week wait for more (whoops!)<br />
</span></p>
<h3>Brownstone Boys: <span class="s1">The &#8220;Don&#8217;ts&#8221; of renovating</span></h3>
<h4><span class="s4">1. Don’t live in a construction zone.</span><span class="s1"> We know it’s tempting.</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PBOqdbPvZtM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-44991 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-ParlorAfter.jpg" alt="Brownstone Boys renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-ParlorAfter.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-ParlorAfter-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-ParlorAfter-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Photo: Bridget Badore</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The budget is tight and a month-long camping trip in your own house might sound fun, but the process can be stressful. It can easily spill over into the unmanageable. Don’t have a hard deadline to finish. Whether it&#8217;s a lease expiring, a previous home sold, a due date, have a backup plan should the project go over. It will be less stressful for you and your family and your contractor can focus on completing the renovation. </span><span class="s1">It will likely be worth the expense to have some lease overlap or temporary living arrangements so that you have some breathing room.</span></p>
<h4><span class="s4">2. Don’t change your mind<span>—</span>and your plans<span>—</span>throughout the process</span><span class="s1"> </span></h4>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/VpUYH6XBuBY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44986 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-StairRailing.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-StairRailing.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-StairRailing-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span class="s1">It’s one of the biggest causes of delays. Changing finishes, configuration, and plans mid-renovation will slow things down to a crawl. Make decisions early so that you have time to let them sink in so that any changes are made well before that phase starts.<b></b></span></p>
<h4><span class="s4">3. Don’t put off work that can easily be done while walls are open and unpainted</span><span class="s1"><b> </b></span></h4>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/TjbuyyLT2CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44981 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-FrontDoor.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-FrontDoor.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BrownstoneBoys-FrontDoor-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span class="s1">Your budget might require you to push some items to the future, but make sure they are projects that make sense to do once the main renovation is complete. For example, don&#8217;t add an AC system or move walls. You will destroy a lot of recently finished walls and floors. While your walls are open, do the projects that require any electrical or plumbing changes. </span><span class="s1">Before the floors are finished, this is the time to move walls. Adding new windows or putting in that steel deck are items that could be put off for later. They likely won’t require you to undo what’s already been done. <b></b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So you’ve fallen for a condo with a fabulous city, water or beach view. The floor plan and square footage suit your needs and the price is right. What else do you need to know?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One huge factor that may even impact securing a mortgage is the cost of monthly fees associated with a Homeowners Association. Here, Sweeten outlines the important elements to consider <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">before you purchase</a> an HOA property. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What is an HOA?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">High-rise ownership means sharing in the maintenance of common areas and all those amenities you love—swimming pool, green space, exercise rooms, etc. Whether it’s a condo, co-op, or townhome that’s part of a complex, all homeowners who buy in become members of their building’s Homeowners Association. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a board, typically made up of 5 to 15 residents elected by owners, to govern the rules and regulations (specifically, CC &amp; R or Covenants, or Conditions and Restrictions), usually for a two-year term. This group of directors meets annually, with some meetings throughout the year, open to homeowners except for voting. The board assesses budgets, services, any business that involves day-to-day operations, and making sure that established rules and regulations are met. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The goal of an overall yearly plan is to decide how much monthly HOA fees (aka assessments) need to be in order to cover expenses.  Part of the expense is a property management fee as well as salaries for on-site personnel, like a building manager, assistant, engineer, and cleaning crew. The HOA also is a sounding board for issues homeowners may have, either in the building or surrounding neighborhoods.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>HOA fees, explained</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fees range from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars. This depends on the age and size of the building (how many units), amenities and total expenditures, prorated according to the size of the apartments—studio, one, two or three or more bedrooms, with the largest at the top end of the sliding scale. Also factored in are particular unit features like larger balconies, private penthouse roof decks, and parking spaces. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“By law, I’m required to list capital expenditures for the next two years,” says one condo manager in Chicago’s South Loop. That requires keeping tabs of utility prices and expected hikes as well as phone and cable charges, with periodic negotiating—in one case, that saved almost $100,000 and significantly upped the building’s internet speed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While fees sometimes stay static, they usually rise yearly, sometimes up to 4 percent or more. Also, unexpected city hikes, such as an 8 percent water increase, are difficult to anticipate. Your HOA fee is a constant, just like property taxes. Your home may be foreclosed by the association, if you don’t pay..</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What do HOA fees cover?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HOA fees generally are part of monthly assessments, which basically address what it costs to maintain common areas. Here is what they may cover depending on your building’s property:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Vacuuming and cleaning in lobbies, hallways, and mailrooms, and general building maintenance.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Trash pick-up (by the city or private companies).<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">For buildings with pools, there’s cleaning and maintenance.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">For green areas, there may be landscaping contractors who keep an eye on planters so they don’t leak, water plants (either by hand or with an irrigation system), and weed on a regular basis.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Garages are power washed, usually at least twice a year, to maintain the membrane of the concrete floor, limiting deterioration.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Property management fee and on-staff salaries, as well as insurance and a reserve account.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Before you buy, what you need to know about HOAs</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even if everything seems perfect about your prospective home, it’s crucial to check out the financial health of the building, just as you might examine all the mechanicals and exterior components of a single-family home. Meet the management and ask questions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a good idea to consult with a real estate lawyer (even better, one who specializes in HOAs) to take a look at the history of assessments over the course of the last 5 to 10 years. How many raises have there been, and what is the percentage of those raises? Check for any red flags. One could be an unusual number of apartments for sale at a given time. Or special assessments—what they were for, how much they were. Ask how much capital is in reserves. This is a critical point.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ask how much capital is in reserves. This is a critical point. Some associations will set aside at least $50,000 each year for the what-ifs. Owners obviously don’t want to see assessments rise. “But,” says one manager, “what if the gas contract goes up a lot? What kind of electricity contract has been negotiated?  What if union or non-union paying health benefits rise? It has to be run like a business,” with an eye on the bottom line and ever-changing rates, just like the cost of living.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If there’s a major breakdown—a roof, a boiler, an elevator issue, and there’s not enough in reserves, you’ll get hit up with a special assessment. Some condos hire attorneys or specialists to lobby for lowering property taxes. That might translate to a one-time monthly upcharge, like $75. But a major issue, like a burst pipe or a mechanical issue with an elevator, can mean big bucks.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Is it sustainable?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You may also have concerns about sustainability, energy-saving, and using eco-friendly materials. Many buildings are switching to longer-lasting LEDs, which will cut down on costs. Some buildings use enzyme and plant-based cleaning products, organic materials for flower and community herb gardens, and stay away from harsh chemical treatments for weeds. Pet-friendly buildings also are mindful of keeping snow off of sidewalks with salt that doesn’t harm paws. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How do you work with an HOA?</b></span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>If you want to rent out your unit: </b>This<b> </b>really falls under rules and regulations and some buildings have taken a stricter stance against rentals, because of Airbnb. Many now require long-term contracts with a minimum of six months, and the prospective renters need to be thoroughly vetted, with references and credit histories. Liability is a serious issue.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>While remodeling: </b>So, about that kitchen? The cabinets and countertops really aren’t your style. The appliances need updating, and so do the sink and faucet.<b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even if you had a contractor ready to start tomorrow, that probably can’t happen. Why?</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">First, you need the approval of the HOA. That means you need a written game plan, detailing everything that is proposed. Spell out the kinds of cabinetry you’ll use, appliances, floor covering, backsplash and counter material, electrical and plumbing plans. In many instances, you can’t change the site of plumbing. There are some restrictions on materials. With flooring, there might be sound considerations (with a baffling subfloor for tile, for example), so you need to ask. Familiarize yourself with rules and regs before you hire an architect or contractor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Hire a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed general contractor</a>. A general contractor will have licensed and insured plumbers, electricians on board, tile and counter installers (or people they work with), plus painters, so you can source all through one person. The contractor needs proof of licensing, bonding and insurance, and generally needs to add your condo building address to that insurance. The reason for this is if something goes south in a major way, not only will you be sued, but so will the building for not doing due diligence.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once the board reviews your proposal and sees no red flags, you’ll be given approval. This may take some time. Obviously, you need to coordinate time for work, respecting other homeowners by sticking to daytime work, limiting noise as much as possible. Also, freight elevators must be reserved in advance for deliveries of larger items like appliances and cabinetry.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The bottom line with HOAs</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Obviously, HOA fees can hugely impact your bottom line, as you need to factor in assessments along with mortgage payments, utilities you are responsible for (electrical, phone/cable, for example), your own property insurance, as well as property taxes. With the right research and proper planning, you can be on your way to finding the right home with a sound Homeowners Association to work with.</span></p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Welcome to #15 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a> with any reno questions or dilemmas you’d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: Why should I move out during my renovation? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>The answer is, because you love yourself, and you want to stay healthy. There are so many airborne particles in the air during a renovation, from paint to sometimes, asbestos. We highly recommend that people <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">move out of the space when they&#8217;re gut renovating</a>, although it&#8217;s not necessary for every project or to move out for the entire time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If, for some reason, you can&#8217;t, whether it&#8217;s financial or otherwise, we suggest that you put some kind of vapor barrier between the space where you are living and where the renovation is happening. You want to make sure that you are healthy throughout your entire renovation. Think about it: while someone is demoing, they usually have a mask on and they also leave the property. You don&#8217;t want to be sleeping in a room filled with dust particles. We definitely suggest to at least move out of your space during the dusty demolition phase.</p>

<span class="img-label"> Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Welcome to #12 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:team@sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">team@sweeten.com</a> with any reno questions or dilemmas you’d like addressed.</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>QUESTION: How do I document change orders? </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>Each general contractor has his or her own methodology when it comes to documenting change orders (changes that alter the original scope agreed and signed upon), but they should definitely be documented in some way. Change orders can be as simple as a contractor opening up a wall and discovering that pipes or electrical wires need to be replaced or updated before installing an appliance. Another common change order is when a renovator chooses materials that require special installation, such as a tile that has a complex pattern or is very small or large-format.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Documenting can be a quick snap of a photo with a written description and the cost; just make sure that changes are documented, understood, and approved on your end before they move forward. Have that conversation up front with your general contractor because inevitably (or I would say with most projects), there are at least one or two change orders.</p>
