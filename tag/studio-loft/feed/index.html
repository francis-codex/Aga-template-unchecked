										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A renovation gives a design-obsessed owner the ultimate pad</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>For a lot of singles in New York City, a 500-square-foot Greenwich Village studio with both a lofted bedroom and an outdoor balcony would sound like a pie-in-the-sky find. But new homeowner Carly Schulte had a higher vision for this downtown co-op—she knew when she saw it that she could improve on it. She snapped up the apartment and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/26202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors. Here’s how Carly literally raised the lofty studio’s roof, with a Sweeten general contractor, making it a party-friendly place that feels larger than it really is.</i></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Carly</i></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I was lucky in the apartment hunt. I’d only been to a handful of showings, but when I saw this place, I knew I wanted to make an offer. I have a soft spot for lofts, and the balcony made it a must-have. I’d been <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planning—and saving—to buy</a> an apartment for years, and it was a good thing I waited. The sellers were motivated. I put in a bid and pulled off the purchase.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I’d envisioned an overhaul that included renovating the kitchen and bathroom, modernizing the loft and stairs, and adding a giant wall-to-wall built-in of shelves and closets in the living room,</span><span class="s1"> but it was once I was there that I clarified my goals. I realized I wanted to expand the kitchen, since I love to cook; I needed a larger kitchen peninsula that would serve as both a work and eating surface. </span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Although I left things like cabinet dimensions and stair specs to the professionals, I selected all the flooring, cabinets, [and other finishes].</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It dawned on me, too, that I wanted to raise the ceiling. One of the apartment’s previous owners had actually <i>dropped</i> it by at least five feet, wasting space and blocking light. In my mind, high ceilings are pretty much universally beloved and will definitely add value when I ultimately go to sell the apartment. I saw that by reclaiming the height, I could enclose the sleeping loft, allowing it to feel private but still be bright. I designed the windowed loft wall by looking through Instagram and showing the drawings to my Sweeten contractor. He found a way to make the enclosure with sliding glass panels that transmit both air and light.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I knew when I hired my contractor that I wanted to work this way, doing my own design work, and I was happy to find a contractor who would work with me. To say I was hands-on would be an understatement. Although I left cabinet and stair specs to the professionals, I handled most of the materials including the cabinets, tile, and appliances, as well as the layouts for each room (which was surprisingly time-consuming). </span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">When it came to aesthetics, I stayed neutral, particularly in more permanent elements like flooring and cabinetry. But I have a huge interest in texture, and I was excited about mixing flat, modern, cool elements, such as the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/stairs-that-are-a-real-design-treat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">steel staircase</a> and black cabinetry [a <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/home/photo-gallery/45662050/image/45662053/Deep-Dark">great way to create depth</a>], with warmer ones, like the wood-grain floors and golden-brown leather and upholstery. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To achieve the look I wanted, we had to do the work. It was a challenge, with bumps. The worst came early, when we demolished the kitchen and found asbestos. Remediation cost about $6,000 and added three months to the timeline. I would strongly recommend asbestos testing during the diligence phase to any potential buyer. Had I tested up-front and knocked some of the abatement costs off of the purchase price, I would have saved money.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">From start to finish, excluding the asbestos work, my renovation spanned five months. I moved out for several weeks when the contractor knocked down walls and raised the ceiling. For much of it, though, I was there. I had no kitchen for six months and lived out of suitcases and boxes. Luckily, my bedroom remained mostly untouched, so once the enclosure was finished, I spent my home time up there. I don’t regret slumming it. The money I saved on short-term housing enabled me to buy the gas stove of my dreams!</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I heavily underestimated how long the approval process would take. The time it took just to obtain the co-op board’s approval for my plan was nearly six months. Staying in my rental apartment in hopes of a fast renovation was a big mistake. If I had it to do again, I would move in right after closing, live in my new space, and use that rent money for something meaningful. Hindsight is 20/20!</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">People have asked how I lived through the project. I think I blocked some of it out, but I do remember leaning on the Sweeten team after a few long construction delays made me feel frustrated and uncertain. They offered me a sounding board and helped me adjust my expectations, and as a first-time renovator struggling to parse out the delays, their guidance was immensely helpful. When needed, Sweeten contacted my contractor and helped to keep things moving smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Despite the difficulties, I love the way the place turned out. The raised ceiling, now about 16 feet high, changed the entire feel of the place. The library ladder, a functional addition facilitating access to the high cupboards, added a fun touch, and the loft enclosure made the bedroom feel cozy and intimate. My new kitchen has made cooking every meal a pleasure, and even the bathroom is beautiful, which is rare to say about a bathroom. There was stress and sweat, sure. But designing the space was one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever worked on.</span></p>
