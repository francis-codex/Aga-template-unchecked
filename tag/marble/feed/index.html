			<h2>From granite to quartz, different types of kitchen countertops can deliver on both looks and performance</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41793 mb-0 size-full" title="Caesarstone countertop in Statuario Maximus" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Image of granite countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>Updated on October 14, 2021</em></span></span></p>
<p>After <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen cabinets</a>, kitchen countertops have the most style impact in the kitchen. There are many types of kitchen countertops to choose from—stone, quartz, solid surfacing, wood, to identify the most popular—so you’ll want to take a few factors into consideration before pulling out your wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where will it go? Will it be attractive if it’s visible from adjoining living areas as well as the cooking space?</li>
<li>How will you use it and how often? Can it stand up to common spills and daily impact with cooking tools?</li>
<li>What other features will it connect to? Will it look good and stand up to adjoining elements, like a sink or a stovetop?</li>
<li>How often do you clean? Besides the after-meal swipe with a sponge, are you up for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ways-care-renovated-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taking the time for regular maintenance</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Happily, whatever your answers are to the questions above, there is a countertop for you. Today’s eclectic kitchen styles also welcome a mix of materials, so don’t worry about everything matching. You can have one material for the island and another for the countertop, or treat yourself to a small slab of marble for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar space</a>, for instance. For best results, always hire a professional certified to fabricate and install the particular material you choose.</p>
<p>Below are popular kitchen countertops that Sweeten homeowners have installed, along with the pros and cons of each material.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Marble kitchen countertops</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25997 mb-10 size-full" title="Carrera marble countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="Image of marble kitchen countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Carrara marble kitchen countertops in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lia and Chris’ kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Sought for its classic beauty and variety, marble still draws its fans among homeowners who want to have stone in the kitchen. However, it is more porous than granite, and this factor—combined with a high price tag—limits its application to a few areas of the kitchen, like entertaining or baking areas. Remember that this particular material enjoyed pride-of-place in grand homes in the last two centuries, so if you are up for classic elegance that yields a timeworn patina, this could be the stone for you.</p>
<h4>Cost of <strong>marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at more than $100 per square foot (which does not include fabrication)</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Pros of marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Withstands high heat</li>
<li>Adds a high-quality, luxury look suitable for traditional or contemporary kitchens</li>

<li>Limited in color choices—whites, grays, blacks</li>
<li>Stains, scratches, cracks, and chips more easily than other stones</li>
<li>Requires monthly sealing and may still discolor</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soapstone countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43650 mb-10 size-full" title="Blue/green soapstone countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15.jpg" alt="Image of soapstone countertop and backsplash" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Soapstone countertops in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janet and Jerry&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Soapstone’s resistance to heat and water, along with a muted color palette marked by subtle veining, makes it an appealing alternative to granite and marble. It also comes with a slightly lower price tag, which is attractive to budget-conscious homeowners. However, soapstone countertops do require care, like all stones.</p>
<h4>Cost of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $70-$100 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resists heat and water</li>
<li>Color tends to be uniform throughout the slab</li>
<li>Suitable for sinks, too, if you want a blended look</li>
<li>Comes in at the lower price spectrum of natural stone</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scratches easily and will show stains, which can be sanded out</li>
<li>May crack or chip if you aren’t careful when working on it</li>
<li>Requires regular sealing and will show stains if not wiped up immediately</li>
<li>Develops a patina over time, which you may or may not like</li>
</ul>
<h3>Engineered stone countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45708 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14.jpg" alt="Image of townhouse kitchen with engineered stone counters" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Engineered quartz countertops by Caesarstone in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellamy and Zak&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Of all the types of kitchen countertops, engineered stone is probably the toughest surface on the market. This material is typically 90 percent quartz mixed with pigments and polyester resin, then manufactured under pressure into highly dense slabs. Manufacturers such as Caesarstone offer a vast array of looks, including many faux granites as well as the whitest whites, blackest blacks, and some brilliant colors like red and blue. Claims that it won’t stain or fade or succumb to high heat make them <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;popular kitchen countertops&quot;}">popular kitchen countertops</span>, edging out granite, despite the fact that the cost is roughly the same or higher than natural stone.</p>
<h4>Cost of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $100 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most impervious of all surfaces; resists heat, stains, scratches, bacteria, fading</li>
<li>Huge selection of patterns and colors, including faux stones and custom colors</li>
<li>Can be manufactured into nearly any shape you want</li>
<li>Requires no sealing or special maintenance</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Faux stone doesn’t appear to look like real stone</li>
<li>May crack on sudden impact with a heavy object</li>
<li>Costs as much as real stone</li>
<li>Solid-colored slabs will show seams</li>
</ul>
<h3>Granite countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41793 mb-10 size-full" title="honed black granite countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Image of granite countertops in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above) Granite countertops in </em><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/kitchen-renovation-east-hampton-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ann&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Granite landed on the kitchen scene a little over two decades ago and remains popular. It’s a close second behind the number one choice, engineered stone, according to a survey from the National Kitchen and Bath Association. Why do granite countertops endure? Simply put, they combine unique beauty with durability and low maintenance. The natural grain means no two slabs will be identical. While very hard and impervious to heat, granite is porous, so it needs to be sealed at least annually—easy enough with hand application by sponge.</p>
<h4>Cost of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts around $60-$100 per foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resists high heat</li>
<li>Comes in a range of colors and grains</li>
<li>Each slab has a unique appearance</li>
<li>Maintains its value if well cared for, including sealing annually</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Expensive, but popular colors come in lower prices</li>
<li>Shows wear from knives and spills like vinegar, citrus juice, and oils, so use a cutting board on top</li>
<li>Requires regular maintenance, which a DIY project with a sealant and a sponge can accomplish</li>
<li>Will crack if improperly installed or a heavy object makes an impact</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solid surface countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49495 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen with black and white floor" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/an-architect-guided-art-deco-renovation-for-a-queens-townhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Architects Can Vu Bui, Lane Rick, and Matthew Storrie&#8217;s kitchen remodel </a></span></p>
<p>Twenty years ago, solid surfacing was the darling in the world of kitchen countertops. It still deserves consideration, as many qualities have been improved over time by brands like <a href="https://www.corian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corian</a>. It is heat- and stain-resistant and comes in a range of looks, including faux stone, and lots of fashion colors. Because it has a little give, due to it being made of acrylic or polyester or a blend of the two, objects dropped on solid surface counters are less likely to break. It also can be molded into many shapes, including intricate inlays, edge and backsplash treatments, as well as furniture.</p>
<h4>Cost of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>$80 to $100 per square foot, depending on the pattern and color</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Heat- moisture-, and fade-resistant</li>
<li>Enormous choice of colors and patterns, including custom</li>
<li>Seams fuse together so joints don’t show</li>
<li>Molds into just about any shape including integrated backsplash or sink</li>
<li>Does not require sealing; clean with mild detergent</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can’t take high heat; will lose shape</li>
<li>Vulnerable to scratches, cuts, and prolonged exposure to stains like wine or catsup; requires a cutting board</li>
<li>Faux stone looks don’t exactly resemble stone</li>
<li>Not recyclable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wood countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44120 mb-10 size-full" title="walnut wood countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13.jpeg" alt="Image of kitchen with wooden butcher block countertop" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Wood countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovate-railroad-apartment-home-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lavanya and Regis&#8217; kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Probably America’s earliest type of kitchen countertop, wood is still desired for its natural beauty and warmth. Wood countertops can take moderate heat, but it will show burns, dings, and knife cuts. Fans consider the patina part of the appeal. Most damage can be sanded out; be sure to reapply food-safe mineral oil after any repair. Avoid installation in areas like the sink with prolonged exposure to moisture, which will cause it to swell. Clean with a damp sponge and a mild detergent. Hardwoods such as maple and oak are most commonly used as kitchen countertops, in a butcher-block pattern, which provides additional strength. Another pro of wood countertops: they&#8217;re a thriftier choice than many of the other types of countertops described above.</p>
<h4>Cost of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $35 per square foot; rarer woods can be more expensive</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easy to clean and repair</li>
<li>Good for cutting and chopping; knives won’t dull with contact</li>
<li>Won’t chip and objects dropped on it are less likely to break</li>
<li>Provides a rich look for a price lower than many other kitchen surfaces</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable to moisture, chemicals, and high heat, which cause permanent damage</li>
<li>Immediately shows signs of use</li>
<li>Expands or contracts with extreme swings in a moist environment</li>
<li>Requires food-safe sealant and regular care to preserve the surface</li>
</ul>
<h3>Laminate countertops<b></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26004 mb-10 size-full" title="Dekton laminate countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg" alt="Image of laminate kitchen countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Laminate countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan and Mike’s kitchen remodel</a></span><br />
<b></b></p>
<p>While not so rugged as most types of countertops today, laminate countertops still have plenty of upsides. To start, laminate countertops come in loads of patterns and colors and have a thrifty price tag. Made of resin-covered paper backed by plywood or particleboard, laminate does come with its share of synthetics. To ensure your indoor air quality, look for laminate countertops certified by Greenguard, like <a href="https://www.wilsonart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilsonart.</a> This indicates they are made from low-emitting materials that use formaldehyde-free paper and low- or non-toxic glues. This fashion-friendly surface can mimic the look of stone, wood, or fabric, or any graphic the manufacturer can think of. It will last for a few decades with proper care, which includes no direct cutting on the surface or exposure to acid or chemicals.</p>
<h4>Cost of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at $10 to $20 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Requires minimal care and no sealing</li>
<li>Available in a vast selection of patterns and colors</li>
<li>Easy to cut and install in tight spaces</li>
<li>Well-priced, particularly for a product with so many style options</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scratches and burns easily; sometimes impossible to repair</li>
<li>Seams show, particularly on solid colors</li>
<li>Allows only drop-in sinks, due to their construction</li>
<li>Anything other than the simplest edge treatment will drive up the price</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stainless steel countertops</h3>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44554 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg" alt="Image of stainless steel countertops in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></strong><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Stainless steel countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-check-all-the-boxes-apartment-for-empty-nesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beth and Bob&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Of all the types of kitchen countertops, stainless steel countertops are commonly used in commercial kitchens. This is because stainless steel can take a beating: from knives, high heat, most spills, and it’s completely anti-bacterial. You must avoid caustic chemicals, but since it’s water- and stain-proof, that’s not an issue unless you use it for something other than food prep. It comes in a number of finishes, including polished and brushed, which help hide scratches. Dings and dents will show up and are impossible to remove without displacing the countertop. But if you want a pro-style countertop, those battle scars can be shown with pride.</p>
<h4>Cost of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $70 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Super-resilient material is water-, stain-, fade-proof and resists bacteria</li>
<li>No need for sealing; cleans with simple detergent and water</li>
<li>Integrates seamlessly with features like drainboards, sinks, and backsplashes</li>
<li>Manufactured to exact specifications, so potentially seamless</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not suitable for cutting; must use a board to protect from knives</li>
<li>Shows the smallest scratches and dents, which are very hard to remove</li>
<li>Noisy when kitchen tools come in contact</li>
<li>Fabrication will drive up the price unless you buy a ready-made sink and drainboard unit</li>
</ul>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The names are similar, and the products are even quarried from the same region. Yet Carrara and Calacatta marble are so different, that you won’t ever mistake the two once you see them side-by-side. Carrara and Calacatta marble are highly valued as building products in bathrooms, kitchens, and in other areas of the home. </span>To help clarify the distinction between these two Italian marbles, Sweeten lays out the pros and cons of Carrara vs. Calacatta, and why you might choose one over the other.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Carrara vs Calacatta Marble: What are they?</span></h3>
<h4>Carrara marble</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Carrara marble is an off-white or blue-gray softly veined marble from the Apuan Alps in northwest Italy, near Carrara. Historically, Carrara marble can be seen in statues and in large public and commercial buildings. However, Carrara marble is now more commonplace in residential homes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The core, or field, of Carrara marble is light-gray, with vague bluish tones. The streaks, called veins, are light-gray, too. The veins are slightly darker than the field. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The veins found in Carrara marble are subtle, not pronounced. Instead, they are soft, watery, or feathery. Carrara marble veins seem to continue and dissipate into the field.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41699 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-14.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen sink with Carrara marble backsplash" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Tina and Andrew&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen with Carrara marble</a></span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble is a type of Carrara marble. It comes from the same overall region of Tuscany, Italy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble tends to have a white field. Usually, the whiter the field, the more expensive the marble.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The feature that distinguishes Calacatta marble is its veining. Calacatta’s veins are thick, bold, defined, and often colorful. Calacatta marble’s veins range from dark-gray and beige up to darker browns and even gold.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta has few veins, but those veins stand out in sharp contrast to the white field.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Should you choose Carrara or Calacatta marble?</span></h3>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Carrara marble</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Homeowners who desire the overall look of marble, but want a more understated look, should choose Carrara marble. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Carrara marble does an excellent job of blending into the room as a whole rather than calling attention to itself. Because Carrara takes more of a backseat, it can be used across large expanses for walls and flooring.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble is for homeowners who want to show off this unique, gorgeous stone. It’s a marble that truly looks the way marble should look.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Because Calacatta marble is all about its veins, it is well-suited to bookmatching. Bookmatching pairs two marble slabs from the same cut so that adjacent slabs mirror each other. This gives the appearance of an open book. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble’s distinctive veins make bookmatching possible. With Carrara marble, you can bookmatch slabs, but the effect may not be evident.</span></p>
<h3>Calacatta vs Carrara Cost: Which is more expensive?</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nobody can call marble a &#8220;bargain&#8221; building material. However, Carrara marble is far less expensive than Calacatta marble; around half the price.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34229 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated bathroom with Calacatta marble walls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></h3>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Pros and cons of marble</span></h3>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Pros</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Premium building material<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">High resale value<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Unique, every slab is different<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Natural building material<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Lasts long with proper maintenance<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Cons</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Expensive<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Soft, chips easily<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Heavy<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Stains<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Requires maintenance<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why is marble popular?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">All building materials have their trends. But <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/room-decorating/kitchens/a8981/cons-marble-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble’s popularity remains more stable</a> than other materials. In fact, no other material looks quite like it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For some homes, marble isn’t just the best choice, it’s the only choice. Marble is frequently the go-to pick for high-end houses with a classic or traditional style. It doesn’t hurt that marble’s history is rich and deep, as marble is associated with Roman buildings and classic sculptures.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Functionally, marble is dense, heavy, and permanent. It resists heat well. It’s also more commonly found than one might think. Italy produces Carrara and Calacatta marble, but Spain, India, China, Turkey, Greece, and the U.S. also produce other types of marble.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45056 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Image of a bathtub with Calacatta marble walls" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></h3>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Best uses of marble in the home: </span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><b></b>Kitchen counters: Use marble as your main kitchen countertop material.</li>
<li>Kitchen island counters: Pair the main kitchen counters with a slab of <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble on the kitchen island</a>. Or use marble alone here.</li>
<li>Kitchen or bathroom backsplashes: Marble works well for backsplashes in the kitchen (though not behind the stove) or behind the bathroom sink.</li>
<li>Entry or foyer hallways: Marble has long been used in foyers, lobbies, and other entry rooms as a show-stopper to welcome visitors.</li>
<li>Bathtub or shower surrounds: Marble is waterproof when sealed, making it a perfect fit for shower or bathtub wall surrounds.</li>
<li>Bathroom floor tile: Marble is a hardy floor covering for bathrooms, plus it stands up well to water.</li>
<li class="li3">Fireplace surrounds: Polished marble can be used for fireplace surrounds as it can be wiped clean.<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to clean marble and maintain it</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You should always seal marble used around the home. Keep the stone regularly sealed. When drops of water no longer bead up on the surface, it’s time to seal the stone again.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Acidic liquids can etch marble. Avoid having vinegar, citrus, or tomatoes sit on the marble for very long. Clean them up quickly. Use cutting boards.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Clean marble with gentle methods. Vacuum or sweep up crumbs or dirt. Every so often, use a damp mop or cloth. Look for a good cleaner designed just for marble. Never use abrasive powders or abrasive materials on the marble.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with the Sweeten homeowner. </i></span><span class="s1"><i>&#8220;After&#8221; photos by Jaksnap Photography. Stylist: TFStyle Homes, LLC.</i></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Deciding to </span><span class="s1">remodel an uncomfortable small bathroom</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We initially looked for a move-in-ready home, but didn&#8217;t find many in our budget in Clarkson where we wanted to live. The bathrooms in our new split-level house were built in 1982. They would need to be remodeled eventually but we’d tackle them as we could afford them. Three ye</span><span class="s2">ars later and with a toddler in our midst, we were ready. The master bathroom would be our first big project.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We had many problems with the original en-suite bathroom. Mainly, it was hideous. I disliked the color scheme on the wall, the warped laminate vanity, and the stick-on floor tiles. Not only was the pattern terrible, but the tiles were coming unglued. The plastic-insert shower was the worst offender. It was small and claustrophobic, and no amount of scrubbing would remove the mold and mildew stains. Even if it was just cleaned, the bathroom still felt dirty. I couldn’t stand showering in there.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">The search for a compatible contractor in Atlanta</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I’d already gotten a few estimates, but we were looking to work with a Black-owned contracting firm and hadn’t found one with availability. In addition, not many contractors want to take on a small space bathroom renovation, not to mention on a minuscule budget. Then I stumbled on a Sweeten blog post featuring <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/support-black-owned-general-contractor-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black-owned general contractors</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted my project</a> on Sweeten and found one that was also a <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woman-owned general contracting firm</a>. I felt really good about her, and she was willing to squeeze us into her schedule.</span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Finding solutions on a shoestring budget</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As first-time renovators, our biggest question was, “What does a bathroom remodel cost?” We had a limited budget and no idea what was reasonable. Our budget was $5,000, but quickly realized how below the average cost it was. We would have had to cut too many corners. We couldn&#8217;t afford to change the floorplan, so we agreed on the goal of transforming the bathroom into a pleasant, relaxing space. As a result, I decided to save money by designing the bathroom myself and doing it around an existing light fixture.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A crash course in a small bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I started gathering bathroom remodeling ideas on Pinterest and making a vision board. We considered replacing the shower insert to keep costs down, but the contractor said it would just get gross again. I had no idea what went into building and tiling a walk-in shower. First, I found out it costs a lot more to install mosaic subway tile than larger tile. In addition, I learned that a shower floor’s drainage slope requires mosaic tile, and the ones that come in sheets require less labor. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10.jpg" alt="bathroom remodel Atlanta with subway shower tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48171" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48169 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8.jpg" alt="in-shower storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With so many types of tile out there, we were glad to have the options narrowed for us. We chose large-format ceramic tile for the shower walls and hexagonal mosaic tile for the shower floor—in marble—as I wanted just one aspect to be luxurious. Even with the thoughtful choices, the materials and labor were costly. We gave up replastering the walls, removing the stippling from the ceiling, and installing a recessed light in the shower, all to keep costs down. We even kept the existing toilet, since it was fine.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Coaching and seeking economy</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There were moments when I felt like, “We just can’t afford to do this the right way,” but our Sweeten contractor helped us identify projects we could do ourselves (caulking holes and repairing molding). </span><span class="s1">We chose inexpensive bathroom flooring for the room. An inexpensive vanity helped, and I found the mirror at a discount home store for around $30. Consequently, we saved money and used quality materials where they mattered. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor provided great input and direction—including talking me out of some bad tile choices and kindly suggesting bright, simple colors and patterns. She never took over the vision. She was organized and communicative, and we appreciated her helping us stay (almost) within our revised budget, even after plumbing issues popped up.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48289 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2.jpeg" alt="color in bathroom" width="2048" height="1365" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2.jpeg 2048w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">The final budget—and excellent outcome</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">All told, we more than doubled the original budget (thanks to our family for the generous gift!) coming in just at the starting minimum <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost for a bathroom remodel</a> in Atlanta. This included labor, materials, random plumbing parts, and a zillion trips to Home Depot for the paint and other stuff I did on my own.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The final result feels larger and is the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spa bathroom</a> of my dreams. It’s so serene. My first bathroom with a walk-in shower and a natural stone floor, both of which feel truly luxe. It’s so lovely to step in there now. Everything is well-installed and of good quality. It’s exactly what we hoped for.</span></p>

<h3>Moving mom closer to family</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to having her son, Alissa had worked in fashion and had a good eye for style, design, and finding a great value. So when it came time for her mom, Tatiana, to find, gut, and renovate an apartment, the two teamed up to take on the condo renovation in Westchester. Tatiana was both downsizing and moving from Port Washington, in Long Island, to be closer to her grandchildren. She concentrated her search in southern Westchester, about 30 minutes outside New York City. Alissa and her family live in Bedford, NY, so that location would provide easy access.</p>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The mother-daughter duo prioritized location and a great building with amenities, and also looked specifically for a rundown space so that they could do a full gut condo renovation. Tatiana also wanted a condo rather than a co-op; in case she ever wanted to rent out the property in the future, she didn’t want to deal with strict building rules and sublet policies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment they settled on was a one-bed, one-bath condo measuring 975 square feet, located in Hartsdale, NY, in a condo complex with a pool, clubhouse, and gym. The apartment itself was outdated and the kitchen and bath were original to the building when it went up in the late &#8217;70s. Alissa <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned to Sweeten</a> and the pair chose to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>. Her mom closed on the unit and began the condo renovation in Westchester just a week later. Everything had to go—the floors and carpets, popcorn ceilings, walls, doors, and the entire bath and kitchen.</p>
<h3>Handling and ordering materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alissa and Tatiana decided that they would <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">order all of the materials themselves</a>, so they could search for good values and have full control over the final look. Alissa explained, “We knew exactly the vision we wanted for the spaces. Working in fashion and living in NYC my whole life, I was able to go direct to the wholesale districts and find the best deals on items like the fixtures and other materials. This gave us leftover money to splurge on designer furniture and lighting!” The contractor took care of the demo, installation, and provided rough construction materials.</p>
<h3>Merging construction and style</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“My mom is very stylish and vibrant; we wanted to create a bright, airy contemporary space to match her style,&#8221; said Alissa. &#8220;We went for neutral gray tones with splashes of color.” In the living room, they chose a calming gray for the walls and floor-to-ceiling curtains, accessorizing with gold-toned finishes and brass furniture. A leather couch offers a grounding contrast to the animal print rug—both on-trend and grandchild-friendly. Dark gray wood flooring and Jonathan Adler lighting are seen throughout the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a more affordable solution, the contractor covered the popcorn ceiling with a one-quarter-inch layer of sheetrock rather than <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smoothing out the texture</a>, which would have been time-consuming and costly.</p>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<h3>Kid-friendly materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tatiana wanted her apartment to be “dressed” in a way that resembled her personal style: classic with a flair. In the kitchen, this meant going with a clean, bright white. Shaker cabinet fronts with nickel hardware were selected for their simplicity and mixed with open shelving as well as glass fronts. Stainless steel appliances complete the look. White and gray porcelain tile on the floor mimicked the look of marble without the price tag.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the dining area, the mother-daughter duo was thrilled to find leather chairs in a bold cobalt blue at a Lillian August SONO outlet in Connecticut. Durable and wipeable, they are perfect for visiting grandchildren and sit around a dining table under a silver drum pendant light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They painted Tatiana’s bedroom in warm ivory tones, with blush pink velvet curtains and a comfortable armchair. The colors are calming, and the high-gloss sheen they chose for the paint “gives the walls a very lush feel and works really well with all the velvet,” said Alissa.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-21.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34252 mb-0 size-chrono" title="open-glass-panel-door-in-foyer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-21.gif" alt="open glass panel door in the foyer opening to a white room after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The serene bathroom is in a similar color palette to the kitchen. The marble tile floors and walls complement a white vanity that has plenty of drawer space. Alissa and Tatiana accessorized the space with woven covered baskets for storage and to add a bit of warmth. They also reglazed the original bathtub and added a glass shower divider to remove the need for a shower curtain.</p>
<h3>Alissa&#8217;s renovation tip: Measure your appliances—and then measure again!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alissa shared with us a hiccup in the process: “Funny story—this was such an amateur move! Before the renovation started, we were online looking at kitchen appliances, got overly excited, and bought a refrigerator without taking the measurements first. My mom picked out the BIGGEST double refrigerator, thinking it would fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the appliances were delivered, the refrigerator did not fit through the front door! It was so annoying—the store had to take it back, and then we had to take very careful measurements and select another style to satisfy the space. After that incident, we measured and re-measured before making a purchase!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite that obstacle, the Sweeten contractor met the deadlines and even delivered the apartment a few days early. Since the project&#8217;s completion, Tatiana reports that “the new space is amazing, and I never want to leave!”</p>
<p><em>Thank you for sharing your Westchester condo renovation with us, Tatiana!</em></p>

</ul>
<h3>Keeping the gallery style</h3>
<p>Since<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/"> galley kitchens</a> are, by definition, usually small and narrow, renovators typically decide to open up the layout as much as possible when remodeling—whether it involves partially removing a wall or creating a passthrough. However, Daniel, a Culinary Director at Serious Eats and his wife, Kate (a director at <em>VICE</em>) decided to buck the trend and embrace their floor plan, updating it to make it a true chef&#8217;s kitchen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="669" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21198" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<p>There were some very visible problems that had to be addressed. The kitchen’s floor tiles had developed corrosive stains over time that could not be scrubbed clean, the cabinets extended to a generic height that wasted space, and some unfortunate layout decisions positioned an old, hulking fridge at the entryway. Worse, the fridge and stove footprints forced the right side of the galley into three abridged sections that were not useful for real food prep. On the other side, plumbing risers in the wall pushed one section of cabinetry out by a few inches, creating an odd corner in the middle of the countertop and adding a few inches of cabinet bulk right at eye level above the sink.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44783" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21173" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>In need of more functionality</h3>
<p>Design flaws aside, the room felt claustrophobic, so most visitors assumed that the problem was with the galley itself. Common in pre-war apartments, the dividing wall between the kitchen and dining room could conceivably have come down, and everyone asked about it. But Daniel and Kate found themselves advocating for preservation as the galley began to play a central role in their big-picture decision-making. Ultimately, Daniel felt really comfortable in a galley: It was like a residential approximation of a commercial restaurant line. Rather than lamenting its limits, he saw it as a pro’s set-up. Wherever you’re standing, everything is within reach!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel and Kate turned to </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for help in finding a design and build firm. They had saved up for this renovation and wanted it to be right—making their two-bedroom, pre-war apartment in Jackson Heights, New York, even more desirable.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-02-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21172" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-02-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-02-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Perfecting the details</h3>
<p>The general contractor that Daniel and Kate found through Sweeten shared the couple&#8217;s vision, committing to getting the fridge out of the entryway as well as installing custom cabinets to expand storage vertically. Offset cabinets were traded in for open shelving above the sink.</p>
<p>Daniel also appreciated the contractor&#8217;s focus on design decisions like cabinet door orientation and space between features, freeing him up to get a few chef’s details exactly right. Daniel wanted to avoid putting the microwave in a prominent spot and was concerned about cleanliness in an above-stove location. It now lives on an open shelf underneath the counter, where it’s an accessible tool but not a visible feature.</p>

<h3>Custom kitchen cabinets</h3>
<p>The Sweeten contractor created a dedicated cabinet for cutting boards, and most pots and pans are found in pull-out sliding cabinets rather than stacked in drawers, so they take up less space but are still easily grabbed. A towel bar, mounted just below the counter by the sink, has become major real estate with S-hooks added for small items for hanging.</p>
<p>Daniel and Kate decided on marble hex tile for the floors. It brings a natural element of warmth with a shape that is familiar in homes of a similar era, and it bounces light from the kitchen window with a little glow. Color for the custom cabinets became a tortured decision. Daniel and Kate paid extra for additional cabinet samples when they found that paint swatches didn’t really help them envision different tones, and agreed on a navy finish that paired well with brass accents already in the home.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44785" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>A kitchen for cooks</h3>
<p>Daniel aimed for a real chef’s prep space with sections of cherry butcher block. It needs mineral oil but is otherwise not that hard to maintain with cutting boards regularly in the rotation. Around the sink, the couple chose a section of white quartz for easy maintenance and to protect the butcher block from water stains. Standard white subway tile adds a simple gleam and contrast between the cabinet lines.</p>
<p>Being avid cooks, Daniel and Kate really wanted to have appliances that could elevate their culinary skills. Key considerations for a new stove were powerful burner output and controls on the front of the oven; having the control panel on the back stand was too out of the way. Recipe experiments and heavy use mean that a food writer’s oven can get pretty gunky, so extra points for minimal nooks and grooves went to the stove they chose. The sink is an undermount with nice depth for lots of pots and pans, and the faucet is a simple gooseneck model with no side accents that might get in the way of a scrub down.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Breaking down the cost of bathroom tile and the top go-to designs for the floor</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-49070 size-full" title="beveled subway tile" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27.jpg" alt="bathroom with black subway tile in the shower" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

<h3>Floor tile from modern country and classic to monochrome</h3>
<p class="p1">While it’s most important for bathroom floor tile to be functional, finding the right design style is what gives the room its personality. Fortunately, the cost of bathroom tile presents a wide spectrum of shapes, colors, and finishes. From the penny round to cement tile, increase or lower the design volume to match your vision.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are some top looks from our Sweeten bathroom renovations—along with pricing info—to guide your search. The price points below fit a wide range of budgets—from $2 per square foot for a classic ceramic and $18+ for a more handmade look to $30+ for a marble mosaic.</p>

<h3>Herringbone tile</h3>
<div></div>
<p>(<em>1st photo</em>) Kyli and Luke&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/1920s-house-remodel-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">black herringbone tile</a>; (<em>2nd photo</em>) Karun&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/concrete-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industrial bathroom</a>; (<em>3rd photo</em>) Greenwich Village <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-village-loft-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loft bath</a></p>
<p class="p1">The herringbone floor tile pattern can easily be the featured focal point in the bathroom. Choose a neutral and the design still delivers dimension and texture. Or opt for a bolder hue for more impact. In a variety of sizes and colors, the tile is popular in marble, porcelain, and ceramic between $4.25–$50 per square foot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Kyli and Luke renovated their bathroom in their 1920s house and used materials that would last. They designed the room to be stark and graphic. Black porcelain tile with black grout produced the artisanal effect they wanted. Sweeten homeowner Karun brought a modern industrial look to his bathroom. A marble herringbone floor tile softens the edgy raw feel overall. In a Greenwhich Village loft, marble is a main feature in the kitchen. The homeowner followed suit with marble in the bathroom with a larger-format herringbone.</p>
<h3>Cement tile</h3>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-25.jpg" alt="cost of bathroom tile with cement black and white floor tile" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56693" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-25.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-25-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

<p class="p1">Cement tile, or encaustic, is durable and its texture has more grip underfoot. Therefore, it is a safe and good-looking choice for the bathroom. Made from natural materials, cement tiles are also porous so they need to be sealed properly. Sweeten homeowners Mitzi and Jenifer installed the same federal blue floor tile in their master and guest bathrooms: one in a stacked bond pattern and the other in a herringbone.</p>
<p class="p1">Plenty of linear shapes coordinate nicely in artist Katy Garry’s master bath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Her Sweeten renovation mixed glossy subway tile with graphic cement floor tile in primarily black neutrals. These tiles can cost between $10–$18 per square foot for an 8” x 8” tile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><span class="s1"></span>Ceramic tile is a versatile choice if you’re looking for solids, patterns, or the look of natural materials like marble or slate. Its water-resistant qualities make it function well in the bathroom. <span class="s1"></span>Brooke and Sam fashioned a perfectly balanced style in their powder room. Wood-looking ceramic tile was the right neutral to complement a black-and-white floral wallpaper in a large-scale pattern.</p>
<p class="p1">Initially, Nicole thought she wanted an all-white bathroom for her basement. She decided, however, to let this room give the bottom floor the personality it was missing. Thanks to her Sweeten contractor, she had guidance with material selections. So, Nicole settled on a 16” x 16” patterned gray ceramic floor tile. Depending on shape and color, <span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>expect to spend between $3.50–$40 per square foot.</p>

<h3>Hexagon tile</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45008 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-3.jpg" alt="hexagon bathroom floor tiles" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Tara and Brian&#8217;s bath, dark hexagon tile paired with light grout grounds the design and gives it a modern vibe.</p>
<p><span class="s1"></span>A Sweeten homeowner in Prospect Heights chose classic white on white for her bathroom renovation. Except for a few modern black finishes, her marble hex floor tile has the graphic pattern of a honeycomb. Expect prices to be between $5–$45+ per square foot. <span class="s1"></span>Marble and ceramic start at around $15 per square foot, and porcelain at $10.</p>
<h3>Penny tile</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16.jpg" alt="cost of bathroom tile with gradient blue and white penny tile" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56694" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29227 " title="mosaic penny tile" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="bathroom tile costs" width="769" height="1151" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Penny tile is a classic option that gives off major vintage vibes. The goldfish artwork, created by artist and Sweeten homeowner Katy Garry, inspired the dappling of gradient white and blue penny tile. It covers her bathroom from floor to ceiling invoking the sense of being in the water. In Brooklyn, Rachel and Michael’s shower renovation transformed it into a waterfall mosaic. Penny tile is a type of inexpensive floor tile, costing as little as $5 per square foot for white porcelain. The price increases to $18 or more for colorful mosaics.</p>
<h3>Basketweave</h3>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>Basketweave is truly old-school, but it’s been making a steady comeback. For example, in Tina and Fletcher&#8217;s master bathroom, it feels surprisingly modern as part of the minimalist design. In Tara and Mike’s bath, the tile lends itself to a more traditional look without making the space feel dated. Porcelain, a material used in inexpensive bathroom tile, can cost around $8 per square foot; high-quality marble begins around $30 per square foot.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Bathroom need color</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Owners Rachel and Michael didn’t want to go super modern with their bathroom update, so they went with a classic look that complemented their apartment’s prewar roots. The original space was dark and in an uninspiring neutral, the shower was cramped and confined by uneven walls, and old chipped tile throughout had clearly seen better days.  A remodel was in order. The couple posted their project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose their contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43078 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Creating more space without changing the layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping the existing layout intact, Rachel and Michael made crucial updates, starting with tearing down the unnecessary wall framing of the shower<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>which added an extra nine inches to the height of the shower<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>and swapping the old glass door for a new one. With a bigger and brighter space to fill, a waterfall of penny tile in various shades of blue shines as a showpiece. The open and light-filled shower with its mosaic of tile is now Michael’s favorite part of the bathroom.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43069 size-full" title="Blue and white bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1.jpg" alt="blue bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43072 mb-0 size-full" title="Console sink and medicine cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3.jpg" alt="console sink" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A contrast between colors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A dusky shade of blue paint dominates the upper half of the walls while balancing the crackle-finish white subway tile with the right amount of contrast. White hexagon floor tile adds another layer of pattern. The tub also experienced a major improvement: out went the old tub with a clunky, external drainage system, and in went the new with an integrated system, vintage-style wall-mount tub filler, and a tiled tub surround.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43077" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Same bathroom, bigger feel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a month of going back and forth on deciding on the replacement, the couple switched out the boxy, builder-grade vanity for an open console design, making the space feel considerably larger. A mirrored medicine cabinet and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">triple-light fixture over the vanity</a>—Rachel’s favorite details—complete the look. The result? A room once bathed in beige gets new energy. [For these homeowners, an open-console vanity was a must.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Dust bunnies averted! Michael noted that his contractor did a spectacular job of keeping the bathroom clean, combating the huge amount of debris generated by the work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Brooklyn couple who loves to cook creates a waterfall counter as a welcoming perch for friends and family</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-26527" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-07" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project</span>: Open up a tiny kitchen in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: Amy and Nick were looking for a new home and wanted a place that was either move-in ready or didn’t need a lot of work. Things changed when they came across a 2-bed, 1-bath condo in Prospect Heights that had a layout that made perfect sense but needed a complete overhaul, so they decided to buy it and put aside money to make the space their own. The kitchen was outdated and enclosed in a small, triangular-shaped nook in the main living area, while the fridge was awkwardly placed outside of it. Because of the narrow shape of the kitchen, there was limited counter space and no room for lower cabinets. Also, the tile floor in the kitchen didn’t match the wood floor that ran throughout the rest of the living area, a look that made the space feel disjointed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>: To kick things off, the couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on Sweeten and were matched with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. The gut renovation began with demolishing the walls that made up the triangular nook to make way for a new layout in the kitchen. All of the old molding throughout the apartment was removed and replaced with crisp new trim. The entire apartment was also skim coated—walls, ceilings, doors, and moldings—and given a fresh coat of paint. Moving the sink meant checking under the floorboards to see if the support beams would allow piping to run in the direction needed to relocate it. Most of the support beams ran in the opposite direction, but luckily they switched direction under the kitchen area, allowing Amy and Nick to install the new sink as planned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall counter</a> on the island was fabricated in Calacatta gold marble and continued along the rest of the kitchen prep areas. Amy explained, &#8220;We wanted the kitchen island to be a centerpiece of the room, and we were looking for a surface that was beautiful to fill the space. The Calacatta gold marble slab we chose was the first slab we saw at the stone yard, and we just loved the contrasting veins and its uniqueness. The inspiration for the waterfall was that we wanted to take full advantage of all the beautiful material we had. We also used the leftover marble for the bathroom—it&#8217;s in the vanity, the windowsill, and the threshold.&#8221; The marble also has a honed surface, rather than polished, which helps with wear and tear. To complement the marble waterfall counter and countertops, a large, white elongated <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hex tile</a> was chosen for the backsplash. Storage was added in the form of pre-fab upper and lower cabinets with a glossy, acrylic finish to replace the original wood cabinetry, complete with a custom-made pantry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All new Bosch appliances—dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, cooktop, vent hood, and microwave—provided a much-needed functional upgrade. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pendant lighting</a> was added over the island and recessed lighting was installed throughout the kitchen and the rest of the living area to brighten up the space. And if you’re wondering how Amy and Nick feel about the results, just ask Amy. &#8220;We use the kitchen and joint living spaces for relaxing, cooking, and entertaining. The room has all the things that make us happy.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Amy found the backsplash tile on Pinterest and searched online for it everywhere until she came across the manufacturer, Pratt &amp; Larson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Kasey set out to find a prewar apartment of his own and discovered original herringbone wood floors to take center stage</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26030 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As someone who works for a real estate investment company, Kasey has an innate appreciation for New York City’s grand architectural history. So it was no surprise when he purchased a prewar apartment along Park Avenue within the Murray Hill Historic District, which boasts landmarks such as JP Morgan’s mansion and the Union League Club. “When I moved to New York, I was fascinated by the prewar architecture,” he said. “It makes New York real estate what it is.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26029 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26031 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_foyer-e1502742377528.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26296 mb-0 size-chrono" title="foyer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_foyer-723x461.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During his search, he specifically set his sights on a prewar building with original oak herringbone floors. Even though the space he was considering appeared to be stripped of any ornate details, Kasey had seen other apartments in the building with the original patterned wood floors. He suspected—and hoped—that underneath the carpeting of what could potentially be his home, he might find the same wooden floors that he could <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinish</a> to their original condition. On his final inspection before closing, he lifted up a corner piece of the sad floor covering, and sure enough, herringbone wood floors in near perfect condition peered back. It remains one of his favorite aspects of the prewar apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That discovery was the beginning of a rather long process. Initially, Kasey planned to renovate in stages, starting with a kitchen makeover along with unveiling, sanding, and refinishing the floors. It quickly became clear that doing the whole apartment, including expanding a dressing closet into a small bedroom and renovating the bathroom, would best be accomplished all at once. The building’s co-op board, known for being strict, took six months to approve Kasey’s purchase. He anticipated that gaining their approval for the renovation would also take months and he only wanted to go through that process once. When he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5048" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project on Sweeten</a>, his matchmaker helped find a contractor who had experience navigating co-op boards. From those he interviewed (including non-Sweeten contractors), he ultimately chose a Sweeten team because of their knowledge working with tough boards and their track record renovating similar prewar apartments. “They came with the experience of what is allowed in a prewar building and what isn’t,” he said. Other historic building details included cement walls throughout the home, which made demolition an involved process but ended up benefiting as sound insulation from neighboring units.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As the board waded through his renovation plans—it ended up taking four months to approve, the same amount of time as the entire renovation—Kasey rarely <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stayed</a> in the apartment. “It was in such bad shape,” he said. He opted for hotels and couches of generous friends. The studio was an estate sale and it looked like it. A boxy kitchen, cheap and tired cabinets, a grimy bathroom and carpeted floors throughout made for a dreary atmosphere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kasey’s aesthetic goal with the renovation was “to be mindful of the prewar nature and reflect the traditional design of the building and block.” For the clunky kitchen with a cramped layout, he basically started fresh. “I wanted to open it up and make it seem as large as possible,” he said. He got rid of the wall that separated kitchen and living room; not only did this merge the two spaces, it allowed the small window in the kitchen space to spill light into the living room. That is also why he envisioned a mostly-white kitchen—to reflect more light into the living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26040 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26037 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though Kasey doesn’t cook much, he specifically wanted a Bertazzoni range after noticing its distinct and refined design during a trip to Italy and felt it fit well with the understated classic style of his kitchen. The range threatened to delay the project when the wrong model was delivered, but Kasey&#8217;s Sweeten contractors quickly replaced it with the correct model. He also wanted a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen island</a> that ended up morphing into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peninsula</a>. “It actually comes into the living room and overlaps with the wood floor to combine the two spaces,” he explained.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26051 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-During-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26050 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26052 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26057 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="1085" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-26724" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/L2A2378-as-Smart-Object-1-723x482.jpg" alt="_L2A2378 as Smart Object-1" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, he let his Sweeten contractor, a design/build firm, guide his design choice that would best suit a building from the 1940s like his. After sifting through 100-plus subway tiles that differed in color, gloss, and size, Kasey felt a white gloss subway tile was the classic way to go. Delicate hexagonal marble tiles on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor</a> and a light marble on the sink provide an understated detail. “There are no windows, so I was trying to use light shades of paint and reflective tiles to brighten it up as much as possible,” he said. Kasey’s Sweeten contractor encouraged him to keep the bathroom layout the same to avoid unnecessary permits from the Department of Buildings. He contemplated a walk-in glass shower but eventually went with a tub for resale purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were practical things to consider, such as storage lost when the dressing room turned into a small bedroom. While a door leading into a private elevator entrance was no longer in use, it helped provide space for a closet. It also remained a nice historical detail in the prewar apartment. Kasey also used furniture as a repository for more items—a living room coffee table doubles as storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While Kasey loves his new renovation—the classic look, the bright space, and those herringbone wood floors—he has a new appreciation for the involved process of renovating in Manhattan. However, he learned one important lesson. “It is much more rewarding to live in an apartment that you spent a bunch of time renovating,” he said. “It feels a lot more like it’s yours.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An architect dodged a shady general contractor in the nick of time and ended up with a perfect Sweeten home</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ana and Leo survived the complex process of selling their old apartment and buying a new one simultaneously—no easy feat!—but were nearly taken by an unscrupulous contractor when it came time to renovate. They realized that they needed someone they could trust to facilitate the search for general contractors and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors—</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">turned out to be exactly what they were looking for. (Their words, not ours!) Their Sweeten contractor helped them make layout changes and took on the challenge of creating an oversized sliding door system that allowed the conversion of an open office space into a private guest suite. Here&#8217;s how the couple transformed their Tribeca apartment from an awkward warren of rooms into an open, flexible space that is both comfortable and refined, including redoing the living room, office/guest room, dining space, bedroom, and of course the kitchen and two bathrooms.<br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Every real estate agent told us it could not be done. That, in New York, it was nearly impossible to coordinate the sale of our current apartment with the purchase of a new one. But my husband, Leo, was determined, so that is what we set out to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a long search and many disappointments, including lost bid wars and a contract that fell through, fate brought us an amazing real estate broker who made it all possible. <a href="https://www.kristiambrosetti.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristi Ambrosetti</a> was not fazed by the sell-buy challenge and helped us find our new home and sell our old one.</p>
<p>The apartment met all of our requirements—a 1,000-square-foot, 2-bed, 2-bath in a doorman building in Tribeca, with great light and plenty of storage space. The interior, however, was still in its original condition from the &#8217;80s; it needed a complete renovation to update finishes and fix layout issues that made the space feel choppy and awkward—the exact opposite of the contemporary open space we had hoped for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being an architect, I developed the initial plans for the renovation and met with several general contractors that claimed to be available for the job. After <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comparing multiple bids</a>, we were close to signing with one of them but decided to do some background checking first. I was shocked to find that the address listed in their documents was actually an empty storefront in Queens. The thought that we were very close to making a substantial down payment with someone that might not show up for the job really scared us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At that point, we took the search for general contractors online and came across Sweeten. We read about their screening process to find qualified professionals, and it sounded exactly like what we were looking for, so we decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg5YkmLFz4a5xkDfbtxLMvC7WWzQ">post our project</a>. From the beginning, the experience was surprisingly straightforward. Posting on the website was easy and we were soon matched with a few professionals. When we started interviewing potential general contractors, we were contacted by Miranda from Sweeten and she helped us through the whole process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the weeks we had spent interviewing general contractors, we also focused on finalizing the layout and decisions on finishes and fixtures. By the time we signed with our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDUErsavPF6GS1QXwyFWAiekS7sA">chosen Sweeten contractor</a>, we were ready to begin demolition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leo and I had been a little apprehensive about some of our design choices, especially when it came to the changes in the layout, which were intended to make the space more open and flexible. But when demolition began, it became clear that we were on the right track.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening up the kitchen</a>, the contractor also eliminated a narrow wall that partially blocked the entryway and made for a very awkward hallway. Squaring off the angled wall between the living room and the master bedroom made both spaces a lot more pleasant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The change that made the most impact, though, was opening the office (which would double as a guest suite) into the living room. Oversized <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding panels</a> would allow the room to be closed off and provide privacy for overnight guests. However, most of the professionals we spoke to thought the panels would be too heavy and could not be done. The Sweeten contracting team accepted the challenge and executed them beautifully.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The one setback we had during demolition was an unexpected electrical conduit found in one of the living room walls we had planned to demolish. The conduit ran down to the apartment below ours and, therefore, could not be moved. After conversations with the contractor, Leo and I decided to take down the rest of the wall as originally planned and leave only the section that had the conduit, creating a corner niche that was perfect for a bookshelf. Once the renovation was complete, this turned out to be one of our favorite features in the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One aspect that had drawn us to the apartment was a nook next to the living room that seemed perfect for a small bar. Early in the project, we pulled inspiration photos online and it seemed like designing the bar would be fairly easy. That was until we decided the bar should also house a concealed 40-inch TV, which then led to weeks of research and multiple drawing iterations until we landed on a design that met all of our functional requirements for both the bar and the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dining room pendants were another big challenge. The position of the existing light did not align with the center of the dining table, and we were not able to move the light because of the concrete ceiling. I had almost given up on having pendants over the table when Leo came across the Swell String fixture, which allowed for the pendants to be installed in any position, independent of the canopy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The finishes for the bathrooms and kitchen were also much debated. We knew from the beginning we wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble tile</a> in the bathrooms but looked at a wide range of patterns, sizes, and prices. Narrowing down the search to neutral tones and classic patterns, I eventually chose an Asian statuary from TileBar for the master bathroom and a Bardiglio herringbone mosaic for the guest bathroom floor, with the same Asian statuary in the shower. As a contrast to the traditional tile, I selected modern Duravit fixtures and Grohe faucets. The towel warmers had been at the top of our wishlist and after much research, we were able to find a small hardwired option that worked well in both bathrooms.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For our small <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">galley kitchen</a>, we chose the same low-maintenance quartz countertops we had in our previous apartment, paired with white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinets</a> and integrated Bosch appliances. The cabinets were finished with black linear pulls with accent walnut shelves added on the back wall for some extra storage. The backsplash was probably one of the toughest decisions—with so many interesting materials and patterns to choose from, we considered all sorts of options, from large back-painted glass panels to intricate mosaics. As a way to balance the modern cabinets and countertops, we decided on marble subway tile from TileBar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our main goals for the master bedroom were to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/bedroom-storage-style-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximize storage</a> and improve circulation. So the swing bedroom door was replaced with a pocket door, improving access to a long wall of closets that ended in a small custom-made vanity at the corner of the room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Leo and I found that all the time spent obsessing over the small details really paid off—it all came together as we had hoped and we were very happy, not only with our choices but with the quality of execution and expertise the Sweeten contractor and his team brought to the project. Most importantly, knowing Sweeten was following the project, and touching base with us periodically gave us peace of mind through the whole process.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Turn an old, run-down bathroom into something elegant and calming</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Mary Ann and Frank’s three-bedroom Upper West Side apartment had done its job since they had bought it in 1992.  But now, with their two kids grown and gone, the couple pulled the trigger on a long-planned master bathroom upgrade. “Our co-op building was built in 1929 and it was the bath from 1929<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></i>same tub, same tiles,” said Mary Ann, who works in publishing. Grime on the tiles wouldn’t budge and some tiles were no longer there at all. Paint peeled off the walls and with no vanity, shampoo bottles were always on prime display. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: To keep the costs down, the couple kept the original layout. But that was all they kept. What they wanted was a stylish sanctuary beginning with a hex tile bathroom. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hexagons were laid on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble</a> topped off the vanity for a refined look. The shower also has matching marble tiles. Their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> suggested painting, not tiling, the wall opposite the shower and vanity. Rather than feeling enclosed, the bathroom now feels “more like a room,” said Mary Ann, “and plus it would have been a lot of cleaning.” They did lose storage space in their master and hall bathroom, which they also renovated. However, a large vanity and two large mirrors with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> built into the wall that were added to the master bathroom made up for that. When you open each mirror, there is also another magnifying mirror. The vanity has six large drawers and two cabinets for storing toilet paper and cleaning supplies. &#8220;We were just going for a more calmer, less cluttered look,” said Mary Ann. “Now, everything is put away.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Mary Ann’s centerpiece is a walk-in shower so large “you can do yoga in it.” The old tub was decommissioned and replaced with a walk-in shower with glass walls. “It’s so much fun to take a shower now,” said Mary Ann.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Whether granite slabs or a full-on marble bathroom, natural stone offers durability, resistance to bacteria, and the flexibility to match every style</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20725 size-chrono" title="natural stone" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-723x496.jpg" alt="natural stone" width="723" height="496" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-723x496.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-300x206.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-600x412.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Laura and Peter&#8217;s bathroom features <a href="https://Sink, shower, wall and floor tiles in marble shower" target="_blank">floor-to-ceiling marble</a>, including radiant heat flooring</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">When it comes to the bathroom, nothing says luxury like real stone. Covering a wide price range, it makes it an easy go-to when designing the bath space. </span><span class="s1">Greater accessibility to quarries, wider distribution, and competition from dealers have all made this possible. An impervious (or nearly) surface also makes it suitable for almost every surface from walls, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank">floors</a>, countertops, and tub surrounds. Not all natural stone is alike, however. Some are more durable than others but with thoughtful attention to use and placement, you can enjoy this classic material in the bath. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choosing real stone</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Typically, the most common reason to choose one stone over another is to achieve a specific aesthetic,” says <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank">Sweeten contractor Phil</a>. “There are just some specific nuances that people look for that can only be found in a specific stone.”</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b></b>The most popular choice for stone in the bath is marble, thanks to its timeless appearance. Before you make your decision, consider other natural elements each with their own distinctive qualities. </span><span class="s1">Granite, travertine, and slate are all hard stones that hold up well to water in the bath, and each offers a particular look. Shop around as every slab is unique.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Think about where you would like to see it used. Will it be used to cover vertical and horizontal surfaces, or as an accent? If you’re working with a strict budget, you can enjoy a small application of stone, as a border around porcelain tile or behind the sink, or as a slab for the countertop. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Marble</span></span><span class="s2"> <b><br />
</b></span><span class="s1">A classic and versatile option, marble works in both traditional and contemporary settings. Distinguished by rich veins, it comes in many shades of white, as well as subtle grays, pale gold, and black. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Among the most popular are the white marbles: Calacatta and Carrara. The veins on Calacatta tend to be bolder than those on Carrara. Calacatta Gold, as its name indicates, includes gold-colored flecks. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Crema Marfil offers a creamier tone, almost like ivory. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Bardiglio is a deep gray stone with a blend of paler gray and black veins. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Nero Marquino is a black marble with white veins. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">All of these marbles take a polished or matte finish. On a floor, use a matte surface or a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/blueprint-comes-life-family-duplex/" target="_blank">mosaic</a>. The smaller pieces, with lots of grout lines, help prevent slipping.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Marble is one of the more porous materials. </span><span class="s1">If you use it in the bath, be prepared to seal it. Ask the fabricator to recommend a sealant product. “Homeowners can seal stone themselves, and there are many easy-to-use solutions on the market,” says Phil. Seal the stone first when it’s installed, and twice a year or so. “The frequency can vary due to use and location,” he says. </span><span class="s1">If you use it in the bath, be prepared to seal it several times a year, and you may have to tackle mildew if you place it in your shower pan, where water is likely to hit it daily.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Granite</span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b>For many years, granite was a favorite countertop for kitchens. <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s harder than most stones and nonporous so it can take moisture in the bath.</span> The pattern tends to be more granular than marble making it easier to coordinate with other designs. It comes in many more colors—whites, grays, and browns, as well as blues, greens, and reds. Install it as a slab as a countertop, or if you want to go all the way, apply slabs to the walls and tiles on the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Travertine</span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b>Like marble, travertine conjures luxury. Think ancient monuments and historic buildings (Sacré Coeur in Paris). The surface pattern combines subtle veins and fine granular patterns for a rustic look. Honed or tumbled finishes soften the effect. Colors range from cream or ivory to earthier golds and browns.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Slate</span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b>A fine-grained stone, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-gets-a-nordic-look-for-bathrooms-and-closets/" target="_blank">slate</a> comes in variations of blues, greens, browns, and grays for an elegant yet rustic look. When finished, it’s not as smooth as marble or granite. This makes it more naturally slip-resistant but still needs to be sealed.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Check for variations<br />
</b></span><span class="s1"><b><b><br />
</b></b></span>Stone is mined from a quarry, not manufactured, so each piece is unique. Color can vary by a lot, so if purchasing stone tile, ask to see the identification on all the boxes and be sure they go together. Buy an extra box in the case of repairs so the replacement tiles match.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Choose the finish</b></span></p>
<p>Marble and granite can take many different finishes—polished, honed, tumbled. There are a couple of new finish treatments called “leather” and “flamed” that polish the surface to a matte effect while playing up some of the grain.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Caring for your floors</b></span></p>
<p>Every natural stone requires sealing before it is installed and then periodically afterward. Frequency depends on the stone type and the amount of traffic received. If your bath sees activity every day, particularly from shoes, put down an area rug to catch grit and scuffs. Make sure the rug is rubber-backed so it doesn’t slip.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Consider the pros and cons</b></span></p>
<p>If you want natural, unique surfaces in the bath, stone makes a great choice.</p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• It resists water, bacteria, odor, and fire. Wet areas, like the shower, will require </span><span class="s1">a waterproof membrane underneath. Factor in regular maintenance, such as sealing. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• As hard as stone is, it’s also at risk from scratching, so lift furniture instead of sliding it, and sweep regularly to remove grit.  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• Cracking can occur without proper installation, so make sure your contractor prepares an even subfloor. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• <span style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing a damaged area can be difficult and costly. This is particularly true if the area is large. Play it safe with tiles or mosaic on the floor, where damage, if any, is more likely to occur from a dropped item. The smaller-sized tile and mosaics make it easier to replace a piece or two.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• Naturally cool, the material is a bonus in summer, but not so nice in winter on bare feet. Since natural stone transmits heat well, installing radiant heating before the tile is set may be a nice perk.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Faux stone and alternatives</b></span></p>
<p>With the recent refinements in high-definition printing, the look of stone is convincingly reproduced in porcelain tile. Porcelain is fired with a glaze making it impervious to water and less likely to scratch. This means it doesn’t have to be sealed regularly. At 3/8-inch thick, it’s also thinner and lighter than stone. The lighter weight makes it cheaper to ship, bringing down the cost.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Check out quartz, like Dekton and Caesarstone. This man-made material incorporates finely ground stone in a high-pressure manufacturing process to produce a surfacing material that is as hard as the real thing and claims to be impervious to stains </span><span class="s1">from liquids like wine and cooking oils. This super-hard quality requires less maintenance than real stone and contributes to the recent growth in popularity of quartz. Because it is a man-made material, you have more control over the appearance. </span><span class="s1">Manufacturers offer faux stone looks as well as the whitest whites, blackest blacks, and colors, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Stone in the bath is an investment of time and money. Your payback is a unique yet timeless look that, with a little attention to regular maintenance, will afford you with a room that you can enjoy for your lifetime.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23868 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-16.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Romuald had a dream: he wanted to live in a loft apartment. His current home, a 1,800-square-foot house in Elmhurst, was definitely <em>not</em> a loft, but it was ideal for him and his wife in many other ways. It was close to both of their jobs, as well as to both sets of parents, and they loved having a backyard right off the kitchen. So they decided to do the next best thing: make their home as &#8220;loft-like&#8221; as a house could be, most notably opening </span><span class="s1">up walls so the space would have an airy feel. Finally, it came time to tackle the tight, closed-off kitchen. Here are the details on a long-awaited kitchen renovation (and a few extras!) befitting two avid cooks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23870 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-Before-01-723x482.jpg" alt="loft apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23862 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="loft apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23860 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-01" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23865" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-09-10" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">After living in his home for close to ten years, Romuald knew that a new kitchen could dramatically change how his family used the space. He and his wife love cooking together, so they wanted to create a new kitchen in which two (or more!) people could comfortably work. Upon his wife&#8217;s recommendation, he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">turned to Sweeten</span></a> for help and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his <span class="s2">contractor</span></a> for the project. The original kitchen featured dark wood cabinets and felt cave-like because of a wall separating it from the main living space. Wanting to demolish the wall, it was necessary to regain the storage space by adding an island. It also afforded an extra work surface and an unobstructed sightline across the whole first floor of the house for a loft apartment feel. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Working with their contractor, the couple came up with a plan for their new kitchen. The original flooring was a tile that contrasted with the hardwood running through the rest of the first floor. They wanted to continue the wood look but opted for a gray “wood” porcelain that would be much easier to maintain (important for a kitchen that sees a lot of action!). <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semi-custom cabinets</a> made it possible for creative storage solutions like an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221; (details below) to be incorporated into the kitchen plan. The warm gray cabinets they chose from <a href="https://www.waypointlivingspaces.com/cabinets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Waypoint</span></a> coordinated with the new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a>. A white quartz countertop and classic marble subway tile for the backsplash brought a clean yet contrasting look. Above the stove, they installed a pot-filler to save the job of hauling a heavy pot of water from the sink on the island to the stovetop.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-11-12.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23866 mb-0 size-chrono" title="microwave" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-11-12.gif" alt="microwave" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Romuald and his wife started shopping around to replace all of their appliances with the exception of their investment appliance—a <a href="https://www.thermador.com/us/products/ranges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Thermador</span></a> range with blue knobs. After visiting appliance stores and making product choices,  he came across one of his favorite finds—the microwave drawer! A built-in microwave was placed high on their wish list so that it wouldn’t take up valuable counter space like their previous one did. When he came across the drawer, he knew that it was the way to go. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Next, their Sweeten contractor suggested the genius solution of an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221;—a much-loved-but-seldom-seen feature in city apartments. This storage unit would house their toaster, coffeemaker, as well as a few odds and ends, with outlets built into the back keeping a tangle of cords contained. With the “garage door” lowered, the counters would look instantly cleaner.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">In the spot where a dividing wall originally stood, they installed an island. While they had intended to build one about six feet long, it ultimately expanded to a 10-foot-long island—a decision that Romuald doesn’t regret one bit. “We can fit four stools along one side, while the other side has enough space for our farmhouse sink, microwave drawer, and dishwasher—and with storage room, too!” Given the space now has the open feel of a loft apartment, they can now watch the TV in their living room from the kitchen. Romuald explains, “We have it on a swivel, so we just swing it around and can cook and watch TV at the same time. This is great for unwinding after a long day’s work.” They also love the way that the breeze flows through the entire space when they open the door to the backyard—something that wasn’t possible with walls in the way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23861 mb-24 size-chrono" title="loft apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">While the project took a bit longer than anticipated due to delays in delivery of materials, Romuald reports that they are very happy with the way it all turned out. And although they had intended on just renovating the kitchen, the project expanded in the end to include new floors throughout the entire living space, as well as a new railing for the stairs leading to the second floor of their house. All of these changes have made their house a dream home for the couple!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tile revamps ho-hum walls and floors in an instant—from tile flooring to backsplash tile.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22453 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg" alt="Geometric tile backsplash" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Geometric tile backsplash in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet&#8217;s Crown Heights kitchen</a><span class="img-label"> .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are, your home has tiles somewhere—the bathroom and kitchen, or maybe a foyer or mudroom. While they serve a practical purpose—waterproof, easy to clean, protects surfaces—tiles have now emerged as a pivotal element in taking a space from flat to fabulous! Look to tile as a style and even a fashion choice, as manufacturing advances such as high-definition (HD) printing and slip-resistant finishes help to create a personal statement on floors, as well as walls. Consider these five trends:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Faux effects</h3>
<p>Improvements in HD printing have translated to tile with highly realistic interpretations of natural materials like wood and stone, as well as concrete, plaster, and metal. And the options don’t stop there. In addition to the oak or walnut look, these woods are coupled with different finishes and treatments—pickled, distressed, reclaimed (with the faux paint still intact), sustainable alternatives to exotic hardwoods like a mirror-polished cherry or mahogany that you might previously have found only in a palace or a yacht. This tile also lets you take “wood” where you previously might not have&#8230;inside a shower, for instance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for stone, you can install a luxurious-looking faux marble for your entire bath at a tenth the cost of the real thing, and without the habitual upkeep, such as sealing. No need to worry about scratches or water or wine stains with glazed porcelain. Why not combine a faux-wood and a faux-stone look in a bath? Most tile comes 3/8-inch thick, so it’s easier to combine these looks in tile than to align the differing heights of real wood planks with marble slabs on a floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a more industrial look for, say, a loft or home office, check out faux concrete in a super-size, like 24” x 24”—again, without the need to seal and with no risk of cracking, like poured concrete. If you crave color but don’t want those glossy 4” x 4” squares you remember from the school washroom, look for porcelain tiles that mimic encaustic cement tiles, with their luscious hues and patterns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Add various textures</h3>
<p>As described above, faux effects are achieved from highly realistic HD printing. Textures are also now being incorporated during the manufacturing process. Some faux weathered wood porcelain tile includes the dings and saw marks you’d expect to find in reclaimed planks, minus the splinters!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brick is making a comeback too, and with the introduction of faux brick tile comes a realistic pebbled surface. Consider paving your entryway with this tactile material—a perfect crossover from the outside in. Colored glazes in myriad choices give this brick fresh, contemporary appeal, and can provide a touch of texture to a space where a neutral color dominates like a shower or backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also expect to find tile with finishes that resemble fabric, from nubby linen to lace to fine twill. These styles look especially warm underfoot, and bring sophisticated depth when used on walls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Consider three-dimensional</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, 3D tile was very popular in those cool mid-century houses that were never renovated. If it was ever on your wishlist, you likely had to pay a lot for something that was hand cast or, alternatively, rough around the edges (literally). However, the demand for 3D has risen among designers for hotels and restaurants, and homeowners are now reaping the results. Manufacturers offer lots of interesting sculptural surfaces, from shallow recesses that resemble waves or indentations worn into stone by water to alternating raised and recessed hexagons to abstract and organic shapes that seem to spring from their surfaces. These tiles are good for feature walls and vertical areas, such as hallways that transition from one room to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Beyond basic shapes and patterns</h3>
<p>The hexagon is one of the more popular shapes to appear in kitchens and baths; it combines graphic interest with a classic outline, providing a strong motif around which you can play with size and color. One manufacturer created a wall tile with alternating rising and recessed discs. The 3” x 6” subway tile is seeing a renaissance, and reinterpreted in a thinner and longer dimension like 2” x 10” or even 2” x 20”. The rectilinear shapes lend themselves to a lot of different patterns when installed, like herringbone, chevron, and the running bond as an alternative to the traditional stacked. If you’re in the market for something more sensual, consider an arabesque-shape tile. Smaller versions will work on the floor, where the grout lines prevent slipping; it also makes a pretty backsplash or wall behind a vanity in a master bath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Choose your size</h3>
<p>If you’ve visited a tile store lately, you’ve probably noticed tiles are getting, well, bigger. Rectangular shapes can be found twice as wide as you may be accustomed to, such as 12” x 24”. Squares, too, have doubled in size, from 12” x 12” to 24” x 24”. Besides their fashion-forward appearance, there are several additional benefits: these larger sizes or formats actually make a small space, such as a bath, appear larger. There’s also fewer grout lines, which means faster installation and easier upkeep. However, the size trend doesn’t stop there. Designers are mixing sizes to create interesting effects, and you can, too. Combine wide and narrow wood planks, for instance, to achieve a custom effect, or alternate four small squares with one large square in the same size.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>A word about grout</h3>
<p>A decade or so ago, most tile installations used a white or off-white grout. It was adequate to blend into the tile’s appearance and still show the pattern. Now you can choose from dozens of colors to match your selection. Contrasting grout, however, has caught on, particularly with subway and other rectangular formats, to get a more graphic effect or to emphasize the shape of the tile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8212;<br />
Your choice in tile can influence the entire space it occupies. Here is how <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arthur and Kate</a> used stacked patterns in minimalist fashion, while <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kellys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-sweeten-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kelly</a> went bold with cement tile on the floor but subtly glamorous on the wall. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet’s</a> geometric backsplash become the kitchen’s centerpiece, while <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua’s</a> subtle 3D tile struck a perfect balance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tiled niches and marble shelves&#8230;pretty and practical</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the minimal approach of floor-to-ceiling tile in the shower surround can be beautiful, where does one keep the shampoo? If the answer is the lip of your tub, adding a few shelves or niches in the shower can be a game-changer. Below, five homeowners who worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, mix storage and organization with style.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29227 size-chrono" title="penny tile shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29228 mb-0 size-chrono" title="penny tile shower niches" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/penny-tile-beige-bath-blue-beauty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rachel and Michael</a> designed a backdrop of penny tile in a multitude of blue hues for their shower, extending the tile to nearby niches. The mosaic, clearly visible behind the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glass door</a>, is now the couple&#8217;s favorite part of the bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29229 size-chrono" title="marble shower surround" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-07-723x1087.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="723" height="1087" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29230 mb-0 size-chrono" title="marble tile corner shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-10-723x1090.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="723" height="1090" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marble corner shelves were cut from the leftover tile for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/holly-kitchen-bath-renovation-greenwich-village/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holly and Christian’s</a> space, an idea that scores points for ingenuity and thriftiness.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25194 mb-0 size-chrono" title="tiled shower niches" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01-723x1066.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="723" height="1066" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario and Joe</a> used gray porcelain tile with the appearance of coarse denim to fill the alcoves in their shower, a callback to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor tile</a> and accent wall behind the sink vanity that ties the room together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29333 size-chrono" title="glass shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-09-600x401.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="600" height="401" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-09.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-09-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-16852 mb-0 size-chrono" title="glass shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-10-600x899.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="600" height="899" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-10.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-10-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>For a sleek, streamlined approach, glass shelves attached to the tile surround in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/new-life-half-bath-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this half-bath</a> create the perfect perch for bottles of shampoo and conditioner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-05-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29233 mb-0 size-chrono" title="tiled shower nices" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-05-1-723x1084.jpg" alt="shower storage" width="723" height="1084" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-pallavi-keyurs-murray-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pallavi and Keyur</a> added some much-needed depth with contrasting black accent tile to their shower niches and along the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tub</a> exterior in their mostly white bath.</p>
