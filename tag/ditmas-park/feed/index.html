<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Gus, a public health researcher, and Katherine, a chef, bought their Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, co-op over five years ago with every intention to renovate—just not right away. When they and their dog Miles, were ready, they came to Sweeten and </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30921"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to facilitate a full remodel of their dated bathroom—a standard white-tiled space with a built-in metal hamper from the ‘50s, impractical storage niches above the pedestal sink, and layers of old tiles on the walls. “The previous owners’ attempts at updating involved putting tile on top of existing tile,” Gus shared.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Gus-Klein-Apt-Before-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />

They were willing to put more money toward things that would be used and touched regularly, like the shower and sink handles. </span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HJHiUiD4Kw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They created a cohesive and cool look with a clever mix of tiles: a herringbone ceramic for a statement wall, classic white ceramic for the remaining walls, and dark porcelain on the floor. The combined bathtub and shower is lined with marble, which their contractor also used to build floating shelves. Matte black fixtures for the sink and shower tie it all together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In lieu of a traditional vanity,  Gus and Katherine chose a wall-hung sink that saves on floor space. The basin is offset giving more counter space on one side. Plus, the double-mirrors with storage ledges provide another storage option.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As first-time renovators, they were also happy to have hired a design-build firm who not only handled the construction but the design, too. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a designer as a part of our renovation team was hands down one of the best decisions we made,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: One of their biggest pieces of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">advice? ”Be prepared to have lots of feelings as you go through this process.”</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovate and open up a kitchen in a Ditmas Park, Brooklyn co-op</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Lindsay, a director at Brooks Brothers, and Roger, a director in pre-sales at StyleLabs, purchased their 1,075-square-foot, two-bedroom co-op in 2016. Roger “loves to play around in the kitchen,” said his wife, Lindsay. While the kitchen was dark, outdated, and not very functional, the space also didn&#8217;t offer a clear sight line between the kitchen and living room. “We wanted a more family-friendly space, opened up so whoever was in the kitchen could interact with family and friends in the living room,&#8221; they said. &#8220;And we wanted some kind of island/breakfast bar.” After living in the co-op for about a year, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and planned a renewed flow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32796 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-1-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Lindsay was about nine months pregnant during the renovation, something she wouldn’t recommend to anyone doing a remodel. “The challenge of trying to get around the apartment that was in complete disrepair was interesting on some days,” she said. “We ended up moving the entire kitchen and living room into the nursery. I’d recommend going on a vacation or taking a long weekend trip during the major part of the construction. You think you can live through it for a week or two, and then realize how long a week or two really is. It would have been a nice break to go somewhere where there wasn’t dust and tools and boxes everywhere.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32801 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Their Sweeten contractor</a> “knew we wanted to get everything done in time for the baby to come<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>with a little bit of time to spare to clean up the nursery,” Lindsay said. “They were good at communicating what the status was, how long something was going to take, and how much time we had to make a decision.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33272 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-3-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Before-3" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-32806" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen07-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN LindsayConnolly Kitchen07" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The job was basically a “rip-and-replace” with a new peninsula where the wall between the kitchen and living space once stood. The only appliance that moved was the refrigerator, which stayed on the same wall. For the cabinets, their contractor recommended <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a kitchen designer in the Sweeten network</a>. The kitchen designers provided the initial custom cabinet layout, then Lindsay visualized the usability of the kitchen. “I mapped all of our stuff from pantry and appliances to a drawer or cabinet. Then I was able to work with our contractor to determine the best shelf or drawer configuration to utilize the space and fit our stuff,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32807 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen08-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen13.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32812 mb-0 size-chrono" title="light-brown-cabinets-white-quartz-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen13.gif" alt="light brown wooden cabinets and white quartz counter and gray walls after renovation " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The duo chose an island/breakfast bar so guests would feel like a part of the cooking process. Tall cabinets like the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry</a> gave them more storage with pull-out drawers for easy access and a large drawer for their spices. A separate small counter and shelves stand in as their “coffee bar.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aside from the difficulties of being pregnant and having to move things during the renovation, Lindsay felt it would have been easier had they spent more time deciding on appliances in advance and budgeting in the little things like cabinet hardware, lighting, faucet, and sink. “You’ve got to be flexible and open-minded to extending your timeline if something is not available immediately, or finding a substitute material.” She also would have raised her <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost expectations</a> another $5,000 to $10,000. “There’s always something you forget or didn’t know you had to pay for, like licensing fees just to get co-op approval.” (See Bonus section below.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32797 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-2-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32803 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen04-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32810 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen11-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lindsay cautions other first-timers to be prepared to pay a fee to show a copy of a license for plumbers and electricians, a fee for an engineer to review the design, and a fee for the management company and/or board to review and approve. There were several back-and-forth discussions to get the paperwork exactly right for the approval. “It took us six to eight weeks to get everything in order and get the final approvals,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the bumps, Lindsay and Roger—and now Porter, born in January just after the project was finished—are delighted to be able to entertain family and friends from their new, open kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32800 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen01-1-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The couple had actually posted this project on Sweeten twice. There were “politics,” Lindsay said, in getting it approved through the co-op. “We thought we could just submit the design and it would be approved,” she said. “The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">approval process</a> for our co-op board was multi-level, which we didn’t understand when we first posted.”</p>
<p>They removed their posting and Sweeten’s client services helped Lindsay rewrite it and narrow down the choices while they searched for a contractor match. Once they found a potential match, several other factors were required by the board, and their contractors “took the time to go through the copy of the board requirements before we officially selected them,” Lindsay said. “As a first-time renovator and co-op owner, we were happy to have a little guidance from someone who has been through this process before.” <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sarah and her husband bought their first apartment last year in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. It was originally a one-bedroom co-op, but they benefitted from some renovations the previous owners had done, including cordoning off space for a second bedroom. Architectural details such as an ornate archway were also intact, giving it the perfect amount of charm. On the other hand, the bathroom needed some work, as did the hodgepodge of cabinets in the kitchen. With two small kids, Sarah also saw a peace-giving opportunity to swap out flimsy doors on the second bedroom for something with a little more soundproofing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though they closed on the apartment in November, Sarah and her husband rented the apartment back to the former owners during the planning stages of the renovation. By the time the building’s board approved the plans, “we ended up with just five weeks to get the work done, including over Christmas and New Years,” said Sarah. They were moving in February 1. With the holiday season in full swing, they had trouble finding a contractor up for the tight timeframe challenge. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16420" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah came to Sweeten</a>, a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free service that connects homeowners</a> with vetted general contractors, to find someone for the job. “It came down to the wire,” said Sarah. “<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3957" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Sweeten contractor</a> and team were still painting as we were moving in.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as kitchens go, the kitchen in the apartment wasn’t half bad. It had an open plan that fed into the living room, wooden countertops, and a farmhouse-style sink. However, cream backsplash tiles that culminated in a heavy printed pattern above the sink weighed the whole thing down. “The real goal in all of this was to make everything as clean and minimalistic as possible,” said Sarah. The mismatch of cabinets also needed to have one cohesive look. The couple went for open shelving to make the kitchen feel bigger. They also loved the idea of showing off their dishes. “They are really beautiful and we don’t mind looking at them all the time,” said Sarah. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinets</a> below the counter were from Ikea and were perfectly fine, but they had wanted to replace them with flat fronts for a minimalist aesthetic. However, for new homeowners, that was a few steps over the budget line. Instead, the hardware was swapped out for a bold gold. “It completely changed their look,” said Sarah. &#8220;We&#8217;re very happy with the result.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One archway in the kitchen was in the original Art Deco style (the building was built in 1938), so Sarah’s Sweeten contractor was asked to mirror the design on an adjacent archway—previously a doorframe. &#8220;We weren&#8217;t sure that was possible, but he did an amazing job!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-29136 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-Kristen-Amato-Bathroom-Before04-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Kristen Amato-Bathroom-Before04" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28709 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog10-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom received the most extensive makeover of the project. The floors needed to be re-tiled with a new shower fixture and vanity added. “It never felt very clean,” said Sarah, of the existing bathroom, which had black floor tiles. “It&#8217;s a small space so we went with all white to make it feel as open as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the archways in the kitchen, Sarah wanted to keep some of the old detail. In the bathroom, that meant keeping the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathtub</a>. Its light salmon pink gives the bathroom an understated drop of color. It was also easier to let it remain where it was. &#8220;That&#8217;s a cast iron tub and it weighs a ton! We thought, just keep it and make everything else white.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom provided the couple a chance to add a nod to a favorite style, Shaker architecture. Instead of using typical towel rails, Sarah had a peg rail made by a Shaker workshop in Massachusetts. “It turns out to be really handy to have a lot of pegs,” she said. “We use them for towels and drying clothes for the baby.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog09-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28713 mb-0 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog09-1.gif" alt="renovation Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The simplest part of the renovation turned out to be not so. It turned out that the new doors for the nursery weren&#8217;t made to be as soundproof as they used to be. The couple’s Sweeten contractor suggested a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solid core door</a> rather than one with MDF (medium-density fiberboard) cores, which can be pushovers when it comes to noise. However, “it turns out solid core is incredibly difficult to find these days,” said Sarah. She only found one option in an extensive search. It turned out to be the perfect fit. Well, almost. The floors were uneven. That meant the new doors needed to be sanded down for a snug fit. The couple also handmade some leather pulls instead of using door knobs. Now, Sarah and her husband are enjoying the fruits of their efforts. “Our girls snooze away while we watch movies or entertain right outside their door,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The priority was using paint that was as non-toxic as possible, a subject Sarah is very serious about, in light of research linking volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from certain objects and liquids, like paint, to cancer. While some fancier brands had whites the couple liked, they decided to keep their <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget</a> in mind and went with something more economical that was also VOC-free. That turned out to be a smart decision. “Our plaster walls drank up the paint,” said Sarah, “and we ended up having to buy 25 gallons when we originally budgeted for ten.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On this project, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five-week timeline</a> wasn’t the only thing that was tight. Sarah and her husband were focused on sticking to their budget. The couple worked closely with their Sweeten contractor to keep costs low in other areas, such as picking up some materials and supplies themselves. It turned out to be a lot of work, including a run out to New Jersey to get tiles, paint, and grout. However, the strategy had a valuable fringe benefit. “It made us very involved in the project,” said Sarah. “We made every decision along the way.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new baby for Lindsay and Matt would bring big changes for the couple, clearly. But one of those changes would mean leaving their cozy Park Slope walk-up to find more space and flexibility for their growing family. Committed to staying in Brooklyn, they purchased a promising co-op apartment in Ditmas Park, with hopes of converting their one-bedroom into a two while subtly upgrading a number of the uninspiring finishes in their kitchen and beyond. Read on for Lindsay’s take on their creative (and altogether pretty budget-friendly) home renovation! </span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-expert-paul/lindsay-and-matts-sweetened-brooklyn-coop-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20345 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Kitchen_Portrait-02-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Kitchen_Portrait-02-1-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Kitchen_Portrait-02-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Kitchen_Portrait-02-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Kitchen_Portrait-02-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Lindsay, Ditmas Park homeowner</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many New Yorkers, after Matt and I had a baby we started yearning for more (or at least a different kind of) space. We lived in a Park Slope brownstone walk-up, and while our apartment was full of charm, we realized it was going to become more and more difficult to live there as our daughter grew older with its stairs, open fireplaces, jagged floors, and somewhat awkward layout. So, we jumped on the real estate bandwagon, setting our sites on convertible one-bedroom apartments since two-bedroom co-ops were mostly out of our price range.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being outbid several times in Prospect Heights and Windsor Terrace, we eventually ended up in Ditmas Park, where Matt had previously lived and where we first met. There, we found a one-bedroom in a building constructed in 1941 with a ton of charm, including pointed arch doorways and an inset bookcase. Our future building was a co-op, and ours was a sponsor unit that had recently undergone a renovation including a new kitchen and bathroom. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18187" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-Before-04.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-Before-04" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-Before-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-Before-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the place was in pretty good shape, the major component of our renovation was to separate the single bedroom into a master bedroom and nursery. We debated over a few layouts and decided to demolish the closets, build a partition, and create a new door opening from the living room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an architectural historian and frequent reader of design blogs, I was familiar with Sweeten and the service they offered. With the baby, work, a long unfinished doctoral dissertation, and the seemingly unending closing process, I didn&#8217;t have much time to do the legwork to find contractors or figure out how to schedule things. When the contractor we selected dropped out for a bigger Manhattan project right before closing, we decided to </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our project with Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;who were great in helping us find someone else in a pinch. In the end, they matched us with a Sweeten general contractor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who was incredibly competent and quickly helped reduce my anxiety about the whole project. We had decided most of the big things, but he was great in helping us think through the smaller issues, such as where to put outlets and what kind of paint to choose.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By this time, our scope had also expanded a bit. In addition to some (unexpected) electrical work, we decided on a few aesthetic upgrades in the kitchen and bathroom, where the finishes were somewhat “cheap” and bland. We weren’t going for total transformations here. Just a handful of subtle upgrades to the existing decor that also aligned with our overall budget.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since our budget was pretty small, we aimed to get the most bang for our buck. In the kitchen, we replaced the laminate countertop with a quartz Caesarstone counter and installed a new stainless undermount sink and chrome faucet, white subway tile backsplash, and new ceiling lights.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bathroom, we replaced the pedestal sink with a more modern sink and vanity cabinet, added metal shelves, and installed new lights. These changes were small, but they made a huge difference in how the space looked and functioned. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, construction went very smoothly. We were staying in sublets, so Paul knew that the work needed to be done as soon as possible. Paul wrapped things up right on schedule and before we knew it, we lived there! It was a great first-time renovating experience and I&#8217;m definitely itching to take on the next project.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re back in Brooklyn for round two of Chris and Amber’s home renovation! Last week, Chris shared a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/chris-and-ambers-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">detailed account of their lovely kitchen renovation</a>, and this week we’re lucky enough to get another tour featuring two vitally important areas of their Ditmas Park home. Read on for a new take on how they made way for a second bedroom and squeezed in a full bathroom renovation, all just in time to welcome a new baby!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/chris-ambers-bathroom-kids-room-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17257" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/amber-bathroom.jpg" alt="ditmas park bathroom renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/amber-bathroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/amber-bathroom-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
Guest post by Chris, Ditmas Park homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During construction, many people, not least of all our immediate neighbors, asked us why we were renovating our apartment. In the earliest stages, we would say, semi-seriously, that all we had really intended to do before things got out of control was put in a dishwasher. We had quickly realized that re-doing our kitchen was going to be an all or nothing endeavor for us and putting in a dishwasher somehow became ripping our kitchen down to bare studs. But once we found out that our second kid was on the way, the focus of the project became carving out a room for our older son that was just big enough to be useful, but small enough to keep the kitchen a reasonable size. After <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting our project on Sweeten</a> and meeting <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these Sweeten general contractors</a>, we went full steam ahead with their innovative design for our kitchen and new kids&#8217; room.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17271 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17258" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten general contractors understood that we needed to be able to fit a standard-sized crib along one of the crved walls, and that if push came to shove we could alternatively squeeze in a standard twin bed running the other way, just in case we end up staying in the apartment for quite a while longer than we’ve planned. We kept the curved walls of the room as they were since it is a nice pre-war touch that conveys the fact that the room juts out into the facade of the building, forming a miniature bay window with a tiny balcony for plants. We laid a new wood floor and installed a heavy door that swings open to be flush against the wall outside the room, almost making it disappear when it’s open. The other thing that makes it feel so much bigger is that there is a full transom milk glass window along the top of the doorway. It brings light into the kitchen and keeps the partition between the kitchen and our son’s room from dominating.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17184" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-13-14.gif" alt="kids room" width="600" height="401" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We only finished the last details of our son’s room a couple months ago: a series of picture shelves from Pottery Barn that we painted to match the walls, a roller blind, and a cheap but cheerful rug from Land of Nod. Honestly, it was knowing that Sweeten was sending a photographer that made us pull it all together!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Halfway through renovating the kitchen, we realized that if we didn’t do the bathroom, it was never going to happen. Our apartment and our lives had already been turned upside down and we knew we were never going to go through it again. The former bathroom had tiling that ran up the sides of the walls which created a tub effect and everything felt very tired and shabby.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We installed large dark gray tiles, replaced the old tub with a Kohler cast iron model, and redid the shower stall which is separate from the bath in clean simple narrow subway tiles from Nemo. The sink and vanity are from IKEA. We raised the ceiling of the stall and installed a ceiling light which makes all the difference. All the fixtures are Grohe, good bang for the buck and they toe the line between modern and classic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17252 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-02-1.jpg" alt="walk-in shower" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-02-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-02-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17251" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-01-1.jpg" alt="all-white bathroom remodel" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Amber_Apartment-01-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every project ends with a few things that you never quite get to and our wall light in the bathroom is one of them. We kept it in the original spot which is centered on the wall but not over the medicine cabinet. Our contractor was happy to move it but in our hurry to move back in with a two-week-old baby we figured we could live with it. Even now, every time I flip on the light I think of how amazing it felt to be back in the apartment after the work was done, so, I am happy to leave it where it is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">After five years of renting their Brooklyn one-bedroom from a fellow resident, Molly Bloom and Jonathan Schultz got a rare renters’ opportunity: they bought the apartment straight from their landlord! They loved the building’s close community of neighbors and were excited to be new parents in a co-op full of young families. There was no debate about which project they’d tackle first: the bathroom was ringed with original orange creamsicle tiles and filled with creaky old fixtures. Read on for Molly’s take on their modern Ditmas Park bathroom renovation.</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/molly-bathroom-renovation-ditmas-park/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16908" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/molly-bathroom.jpg" alt="simple bathroom remodel" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/molly-bathroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/molly-bathroom-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Molly Bloom, Ditmas Park homeowner</span></i><span id="more-16933"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We moved into this apartment in 2008, just after coming home from ten months in South America. It was a rental in a co-op in Ditmas Park and full of young families—there are about 40 children in the building, with two born in the past couple of weeks and two due by the end of the month! Our unit is a one-bedroom and we bought it it from our landlords, who live in the building in another unit they own. I left freelance copyediting to be home with our new baby and Jonathan is a contributing editor at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time Inc.&#8217;s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TheDrive.com. (No, we do not own a car&#8230; Jonathan commutes by bicycle when he has an office job.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bathroom was heinous: sunburn-colored tiles striped with speckled grayish-white ones, original to the 1960s construction. Everyone in the building gets rid of that tile as soon as they can. There was a riser pipe in the corner that got hot and carried noise from our neighbors&#8217; apartments above and below. The flush-o-meter toilet was a pain to keep clean, and it was incredibly loud. There were other original fixtures, too, such as the magazine rack and the laundry hamper, which we used to store toilet paper. And the replacement sink cabinet was strangely low, perhaps designed for oompa-loompas. We wanted a crisp space with easy-to-clean fixtures—that&#8217;s all. We decided to </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3394" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post our project to Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and were soon introduced to </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/818" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Gennadiy</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ready to help us re-build the bathroom with charm. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We completely gutted the original finishes and started fresh with a black, hex tile floor. It attracts a little dust but still looks sexy. We went with simple ceramic subway tile to line the shower and partial sink walls, but in a slimmer 2” by 8” modern format to mix it up a little. We chose a utilitarian wall-mounted porcelain sink with exposed piping, and Gennadiy put the sink a touch higher so we wouldn&#8217;t have to stoop while brushing our teeth. He also recommended a smooth Corian windowsill, which is easy to clean. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gennadiy boxed out the vertical heating pipe and installed a sleek grille to give us some soundproofing and a little distance from the heat, and we chose a Toto toilet on Gennadiy&#8217;s recommendation, one with flat sides to make cleaning easy. We also added a pull-out drying rack because when you have a baby, you need to wash everything all the time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m really glad we got the work done before our son arrived, though ideally any renovations would happen before someone moves into an apartment. I found out I was pregnant after work had already started, and there were a few cold winter days where it was extra tough to be crashing with family and sneezing in single-digit temperatures. I remember thinking, “This renovation can&#8217;t be done soon enough!” And thanks to Gennadiy and his team’s quick work, it was!</span></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34015 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Portrait-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: Blane&#8217;s apartment overhaul is truly unforgettable. The post, originally published in 2016, showcases a mix of high-end materials and appliances paired with budget-friendly cabinets. An accountant by trade, Blane knows when to splurge and when to save, blending stock items with custom pieces throughout his home. Read on for a smart reno and play a fun game of &#8220;spot the pup!&#8221; in the photos below.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After “countless hours of watching HGTV,” Blane started to have big thoughts about ways he might make the kitchen and bathroom in his Ditmas Park/North Midwood condo better. While neither space was in particularly bad shape, he knew when he moved in that he would be plagued by a lack of light in the kitchen, and the bathroom felt mismatched to modern updates elsewhere in the apartment. With visions of a TV-worthy renovation, he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project on Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted contractors, and was introduced to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blane works in accounting at a law firm and is no stranger to budgets, so he was fastidious with his planning, choosing materials and fleshing out a game plan before even meeting with a contractor. With an initial budget of $35K, he planned to brighten the kitchen with cabinets in a lighter hue, substantially increase the limited counter space with an island, add a sliding door to the bedroom to keep the entry transition as efficient as possible, and cultivate a luxurious vibe in the master bath with an oversized walk-in shower and a neutral color scheme in place of its existing minty and slightly medical vibe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15588 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15590 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After extensive research and some early attempts at drawing out his own cabinet footprint, he got started with his contractor. First, the team decided to tackle the bathroom. Here, Blane got his inspiration from an unlikely place. “My first purchase was actually the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilet</a>, and things kind of evolved around there,” Blane said. “I’ve never had any sort of fancy toilet like that before. The new toilet has a remote, which I had never heard of. The Japanese are at the forefront of luxury so we’ll trust them.” The Toto toilet was just the beginning of the luxe vibe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blane chose a combination of slate and hexagon mosaic tiles for the wall, with a neutral mix of stone and wood for the heated (yes, heated!) floors. Then he pulled out all the stops with a walk-in, double-wide shower with a custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding glass door</a> and rain showerhead, plus a double sink vanity, in a bit of long-range planning to make the apartment cohabitation-friendly. The contractor&#8217;s team capped the detailed work with a slanted, but sturdy, bench design in the shower and herringbone tile design on the bathroom floor, all in a soothing gray palette.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34002 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x464.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="464" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34003 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-723x471.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="471" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34004 mb-0 size-chrono" title="shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-723x1069.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="1069" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, Blane chose white upper cabinets with gray base units, giving the space a brightened, more modern effect. After heavy research focused on IKEA, the contractor actually suggested Blane swap his blueprint for a similar cabinet option from Home Depot, which gave him the same lacquered and bright uppers, with a striated gray laminate bottom set. The team removed a wall and moved the oven to the other side of the cabinet line, opening up the kitchen and improving the flow for prep and serving. To give Blane even more space for culinary exploits (and entertaining), the team brought in an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> with a durable, waterfall quartz countertop with room for bar seating. Bonus: The island features its own electrical outlets, thanks to the contractor who snuck in a power source under a few floorboards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34008 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-723x464.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="464" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Blane-Cabinets.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34017 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Blane-Cabinets.gif" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34019 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-1-723x489.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="489" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34012 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the dining room, Blane purchased a stunning ghost wood table, handmade by Jim at <a href="https://www.breukelentafel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breukelen Tafel</a> in Carroll Gardens. To highlight the space, he and the team created a wallpapered accent wall to bring together the table, the gray walls, and the white and gray in the kitchen. “I think the wall, even though it was a simple thing, is now one of the best features of the apartment,” Blane said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34014 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-13-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blane admits that the process was mostly painless—despite living in the condo with a dog throughout the renovation. Though he went over his budget by 40 percent, he admits it was because of his decisions to choose more premium materials rather than any runaway labor costs. Even with the bathroom and kitchen in process at the same time, Blane was impressed that living in the rubble could be possible thanks to the team’s efforts to seal up the work zones and keep dust to a minimum. Looking at the finished product, Blane is thrilled. “I’m really happy it worked out,” Blane said. “Especially since I didn’t have a designer and I was relying on my accountant abilities to make good decisions.” Even though the contractor didn&#8217;t come from a design and build firm, his decades of experience let Blane lean on him for opinions and advice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But Blane’s best advice for anyone going into the process is to do as much research as possible and be prepared to adjust as challenges come up. Inconvenient issues can sometimes be opportunities: when a light problem with Blane&#8217;s closet or gaps between wall and ceiling tiles were discovered, the contractor came up with elegant solutions that often improved on the original plan. “They take great pride in their work, and even came back to do a touch-up here and there as things settled in the months after the project ended, at no additional cost,” Blane said. “If the final results don&#8217;t speak already for themselves, I highly recommend them.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Blane-Sliding-Door.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34018 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dark-brown-floor-brown-door" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Blane-Sliding-Door.gif" alt="dark brown floor and brown door and a staircase" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now Blane has the space to sprawl in his upgraded condo with one of Brooklyn’s most adorable dogs, his new pup, Harvey. However, he sheepishly admits he’s not always using that kitchen for intense, five-star-worthy fare. “I’m cooking now more than I was, but you get in that sandwich kick and it’s hard to change from that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re in Ditmas Park this week for an extra fun assignment! Usually, we chronicle all of the shiny new things in a New York City renovation. This week, the challenge is to figure out what stayed put in a family&#8217;s kitchen and closet upgrade. One quick look at the before and afters here might leave you thinking that this was a classic gut renovation, but a closer study reveals a more surgical project with a lot of smart design compromises that let a Ditmas Park family keep what was working and fit in a lot of extra storage and style.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="sweeten.com/kitchens/before-after-kensington-kitchen-and-closets-sweetened"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14932 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nikkiakitchenclosetv4.png" alt="closet renovation" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nikkiakitchenclosetv4.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nikkiakitchenclosetv4-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-14921"></span>Nikkia and Daniel moved into their 850 square foot two-bedroom apartment feeling grateful that the previous owners had taken care of restoring hardwood floors and putting a coat of fresh paint throughout the place. The kitchen had new cabinets and appliances, but the dark finish and heavy trim obscured the room&#8217;s natural light and the layout made key storage space inaccessible and inefficiently used. The kitchen lacked a backsplash in its high traffic stove and sink area and the previous owners had skipped on cabinetry in the windowed corner, opting for slim open storage instead. In the bedroom, two narrow adjacent closets were no match for two sets of clothes and shoes, ceding precious storage space to an unnecessary dividing wall. The family&#8217;s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3953" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten project post</a> called for giving the kitchen a more modern, light and open feel without making major architectural or construction changes and combining the two small bedroom closets into one large closet with smarter organization options. We thought <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2536" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Sweeten contractor</a> would be a great fit for the clever work that would be needed to make both spots work harder for this family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14934" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14933" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14938" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-06" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-06-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sweeten contractor and his team started in the kitchen with a few targeted plans: they removed the traditional molding that added heft to the upper line of cabinets, gave the cabinets a new coat of <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-color/oc-117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Moore &#8220;Simply White&#8221; paint</a> inside and out, and swapped in more modern and sturdy hardware to complement the Shaker-style cabinet lines. They also added classic white subway tiles from <a href="https://www.homedepot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a> to wrap around the stove and sink prep space, protecting the newly white walls from cooking collateral and replaced the original sink with a sleeker, deeper, and more durable under-mount. The team replaced laminate counters in two spots with a new contemporary gray quartz and installed a more flexible Grohe single-handle sink faucet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most significant upgrade is also in some ways the most unassuming: out with the limited shelving and storage cart that never quite fit in the corner by the window, and in went expertly matched new cabinetry and counters to mimic the materials now in place on the other two sides of the kitchen. Deep <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA</a> drawer storage puts cookware within a few feet of the stove and a translucent upper cabinet displays glass and barware. The new section of countertop doubles as a mini eat-in kitchen nook with its extra overhang. Appliances and original cabinetry and floor tiles all stayed put, saving thousands of dollars and keeping the project on a much tighter timeline.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedroom, the contractor took on two tiny closets with side-by-side doors and a single row of hanging rod space, freeing up un-used space in between and adding simple improvements to every inch. Double hanging rods, open shelving, drawer storage, bright all-white materials, and interior lighting now house a wide range of wardrobe necessities with dedicated spaces for bags, shoes, a hamper, and folded clothes. The contractor re-did the door molding and hardware to make the addition look seamless and matched a new set of extra-tall 96&#8243; swing doors, minus the builder-grade insets from the previous set, for a more modern look.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ever since our <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/site-visit-brooklyn-brownstone-gut-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">construction visits</a> at the end of last year, we&#8217;ve been anticipating our return to Ditmas Park to see this completed first floor gut renovation, built by a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368">Sweeten member</a>. The 1000 sqft, Brownstone home had not been updated in 40 years before AMC was brought in to transform the heavily compartmentalized living spaces of the first floor into an open, functional, and modern family home. The team at AMC had their work cut out for them, beginning with asbestos abatement and structural reinforcing which was necessary to create the new, open plan. They also relocated plumbing, updated electrical, and integrated a new HVAC system before moving onto the modern finishes we see now.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-8075 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/theSweeten_AMC_DorchesterPlans-copy1.jpg" alt="full-floor-gut-renovation-brooklyn" width="560" height="460" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/theSweeten_AMC_DorchesterPlans-copy1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/theSweeten_AMC_DorchesterPlans-copy1-300x246.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />Before the renovation, the first floor was broken into tiny compartments, some of which had no natural light. The homeowners worked with architect &amp; new tS member, Slavica Novak Nikolic R.A. of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Urban Bond Creative,</a> to create a layout that works much better with their lifestyle; the open plan is ideal for entertaining and for keeping the family connected, even when working on separate things.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-8018 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/02_theSweeten_AlanMichaelCarpentry-FloorGut-02.jpg" alt="full-floor-gut-renovation-brooklyn" width="723" height="506" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/02_theSweeten_AlanMichaelCarpentry-FloorGut-02.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/02_theSweeten_AlanMichaelCarpentry-FloorGut-02-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />In addition to the floor plan, the interior finishes were long overdue for an upgrade, which we can see quite easily in the kitchen &amp; dining areas.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="photo-during-renovation"  class="wp-image-38666 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/03_-560x420.jpg" alt="demolished rooms during renovation" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/03_.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/03_-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Here&#8217;s a view from the former kitchen on our first visit during demolition. Once the non-load-bearing walls had been removed, we could already start to picture an open, modern home!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="dining-open-to-kitchen"  class="wp-image-38667 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3057-560x840.jpg" alt="dining room with chandelier and open to kitchen and living room and hardwood floors after renovation " width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3057.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3057-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />And here&#8217;s that same view now! In huge contrast to the cramped feeling of before, the first floor is now almost completely open. We love how the kitchen ceiling really seems to float overhead without any apparent vertical structure. Variations in ceiling height &#8212; where soffits have been used to conceal mechanical systems &#8212; also help to accentuate this lightness.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="built-in-butler-pantry-in-dining-room"  class="wp-image-38668 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3010-560x884.jpg" alt="dining room with chandelier and built in butler pantry and hardwood floors after renovation" width="560" height="884" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3010.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3010-190x300.jpg 190w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> The new dining area features a clever built-in buffet using ikea cabinetry &#8212; ikea&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ramsjo</a> system lets you alternate solid &amp; glass face panels, which works surprisingly well here to create the feeling of a custom unit. White walls here and throughout the space are painted in Benjamin Moore&#8217;s <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">china white</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="butcher-block-island-countertop"  class="wp-image-38669 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3044-560x373.jpg" alt="island with butcher block countertop and pendant lights and white kitchen cabinets after renovation" width="560" height="373" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3044.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3044-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The buffet&#8217;s solid-panel ramsjo cabinets continue into the kitchen, along with <a href="https://www.caesarstoneus.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caesarstone</a> countertops in &#8216;pure white.&#8217; A wood top for the island adds a bit of warmth to the space &#8212; and interestingly, this red wood, called African Padauk, will transition over time to a darker, purple/brown color due to light exposure. Niches built into the wall for display are another subtle but unique detail, adding even more originality to the space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="open-living-space-with-hardwood-floors"  class="wp-image-38670 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3060-560x809.jpg" alt="open living with tray ceilings and recessed and wall mounted lighting after renovation" width="560" height="809" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3060.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_3060-208x300.jpg 208w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Next to the kitchen, this bathroom came as a pleasant surprise &#8212; it&#8217;s so fresh, with its modern fixtures, hardwood floors, and big pops of color &amp; pattern. Bright red paint was custom matched to this awesome <a href="https://www.flavorpaper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooklyn-themed toilet wallpaper</a>, designed by Beastie Boy Mike D &amp; Revolver NY, and printed &amp; sold by our friends at <a href="https://www.flavorpaper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flavorpaper</a> in Brooklyn.</p>

Underfoot, new white oak flooring runs throughout the whole first floor.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="living-room-with-tray-ceiling"  class="wp-image-38671 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2940-560x840.jpg" alt="living room with tray ceiling and recessed lighting and hardwood floors after renovation" width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2940.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2940-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />Looking back through the living space from the office &#8212; it&#8217;s so difficult now to imagine this space chopped into so many separate rooms!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="living-room-with-tray-ceiling"  class="wp-image-38672 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2960-560x840.jpg" alt="living room with tray ceiling and recessed lighting and hardwood floors after renovation" width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2960.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_2960-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> For these happy homeowners, we&#8217;re sure it feels great to relax in their much improved home!</p>
<p>Many thanks to Alan Bowes &amp; his team at AMC, Slavica Nikolic, and to homeowners Sarah &amp; Mike.</p>
