<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Homeowners:</strong> Geoffrey, an architect, and Alicia, who works in operations at a FinTech startup, posted their modern <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/123489#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room remodel</a> on Sweeten</li>
<li><strong>Where:</strong> Manhattan on Central Park South</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> An updated living room creates custom zones with millwork and additional walls in their one-bedroom apartment</li>
<li><strong>With:</strong> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Homeowner&#8217;s quote:</strong> &#8220;Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with homeowner Geoffrey. <span class="s1">&#8220;After&#8221; photos by Kate Glicksberg.</span></i></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">An opportunity to invest in Central Park South</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the pandemic, we saw a lot of people giving up on New York, and thought it was the perfect time to double down. We drew a box around the southern half of Central Park and started searching. A lot of units had recently been taken off the market but we reached out to realtors to see if the sellers were still interested in making a move. We found our home in an ideal building and location, and made an offer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowners and their dog" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52587" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our 1,000-square-foot apartment is in an iconic mid-century building on Central Park South, which we felt offered us the best of all worlds. The Upper East and Upper West sides were easy to get to, and we love being able to spend our weekends alternating between the two.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A love of pre-war layouts</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the past, we’d always lived in pre-war buildings with architectural character and well-defined floor plans. You don’t get a lot of that in modern buildings like the mid-century one we landed in, so we created our own. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, and hired our general contractor. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg" alt="dining room and modern living room remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52579 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Geoffrey-fireplace.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-53002 size-full" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wouldn&#8217;t be adding molding, chair rail, or opening up the kitchen, which are so popular these days. Instead, our plan was to define the layout in discrete ways that would <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create separate zones</a>—a proper entry foyer, a generous space for dining, and a desk niche.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our apartment’s original living room was 13 feet across and more than 30 feet long, so we had plenty of space to work with. Our goal was to create a more intimate and purposeful space that could be used for entertaining as well as a dedicated workspace for those work-from-home days.</span></p>
<h3>Creating niches in a modern living room remodel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like most New Yorkers, this was all about maximizing the available square footage. We had an opportunity to divide the extra-large living space for different purposes. By adding a small wall near the entrance to the apartment, we created a foyer on one side and an office area on the other. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the living room, the focal point was a 14-foot wall with custom-designed millwork crafted from European white oak and marble. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/carrara-vs-calacatta-marble-what-is-the-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single slab of Carrara marble</a> houses an electric <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-remodel-on-the-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace</a> and a recessed TV. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg" alt="modern living room remodel with niche office desk" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52584 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">&#8220;[M]ake sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the winter, the apartment could feel a bit dreary (our courtyard views prevent us from getting a ton of natural light). Installing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/adding-fireplace-renovation-gas-wood-burning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace would turn up the cozy-dial</a>, and we designed the entire living space around that idea. We couldn’t do a real fireplace and weren’t interested in dealing with the hassle of gels or fuel logs. We chose a beautiful electric fireplace that was the most convincing artificial unit we could find.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The white oak used throughout the renovation featured strong horizontal lines echoing the building’s iconic mid-century exterior. The material also helped brighten up the space. Bump-outs of the walls near the window created a defined dining area. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Marble slab realities</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The single biggest issue during the renovation was with the large slab of Carrara marble that would clad the front of our fireplace and media wall. It was 7 feet tall and about 5 feet wide, and we insisted that it have mitered corners. We had no idea what an ordeal it would be—the mitered corners were fragile, and a slab that size was very unwieldy. Maneuvering it through the parking garage and up the freight elevator was a half-day exercise that culminated in hours of positioning, tweaking, and polishing. We were scared the entire time that this 500-pound piece of marble would break and we’d have to start all over!</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Align your budget and your expectations</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My advice to renovators? Really <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dig into the contractors</a> you’re interviewing. Make sure that you’re 100% sure that they can do the kind of work that you want, and make sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In terms of our budget, we did pretty well and came within <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1% of the projected cost</a>. It was about $35,000 including the fireplace. Overall, we couldn’t be happier. The space is doing <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything we wanted it to</a>, and we’re excited to cozy up in front of the “fire” this winter.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<p><i>Tiny pink south Philly row home bathroom needs a complete renovation,</i> our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> project post read. We attached photos, featuring not only the Pepto-toned tiles, but teal-colored rugs and seashell wallpaper. They’d been photographed three years earlier, but little had changed—proof that the project was way overdue. The bathroom hadn’t been renovated since the home was built in 1920.</p>

When we purchased our 1,400-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-know-when-remodeling-a-philadelphia-rowhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">row house in the southern Point Breeze/Newbold</a> area a few years ago, we completed renovations including laying new floors, adding central air, skim-coating and painting the walls, and installing a new kitchen. But we didn’t have the budget to renovate the old bathroom.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Learning from past renovations</h3>
<p class="p6">As anyone can see, the bathroom was ugly. The floor tile didn’t coordinate with the walls. Everything was old and stained; no amount of cleaning made it look presentable. But it was our only bathroom (unless you count the creepy basement toilet and slop sink). When the time came to remodel it, our immediate priorities were practical: finding a contractor who could complete the project in a reasonable amount of time and without sacrificing the quality of materials or workmanship.</p>

<p class="p6">Then there was the goal: To create something that would feel like a sanctuary. With that vision in mind, we put a lot of effort into interviewing contractors who responded to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/86002#before" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Sweeten project posting</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6178#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired our general contractor</a>. In our last renovation, honestly, we had terrible experiences. Like with the contractor who demolished our kitchen so prematurely that we lived without a kitchen for eight months. We were determined to prevent another debacle like that.</p>
<p class="p6">The bathroom was chaotic and we lived with it for a long time, but the chance to improve it came sooner than expected. After twice canceling our wedding due to Covid, we eloped and put the money saved towards the bathroom project. Our families and friends were generous with wedding gifts, further helping us fund the job.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p6">The small-spaced bathroom stays small</h3>
<p class="p6">From the first planning phases, we knew we would have no layout changes. We didn’t want to expand into any of the bedrooms, so we agreed that the bathroom would remain really small. We set out to use every inch.</p>
<p class="p6">Making the bathroom functional—versus crammed—meant we had to be intentional with the size of everything. The original bathtub was designed for shorter people, so finding one that could fit my 6’3” husband was a must, and we eventually did. We chose a trim toilet and a vanity that is narrow, but offers storage. We opted for a barn door-style glass shower enclosure to let the light flow through and open up the space.</p>
<p class="p6"><b><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08.jpg" alt="Vanity and mirror with bronze hardware" width="1000" height="1501" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></p>
<h3 class="p6">Choosing neutral with a pop</h3>
<p class="p6">We also achieved a visual openness with color, or lack of it. We used a lot of bold hues in the rest of our house; we wanted this to be a departure from that, so we went with gray and white. But with this neutral tile choice, we started to <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/how-to-splash-a-bath-with-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worry that the bathroom would be boring</a>—even if it did feel bigger, and calmer. We added the gold fixtures to give it a luxe feel. The pink paint is a sort of homage to the old bathroom.</p>
<h3 class="p6">The right renovation team</h3>
<p>Throughout the project, our Sweeten contractor gave honest recommendations and feedback. He was straightforward about what tile and fixtures would work best and be most durable. We received a lot of check-ins from Sweeten as the project progressed; it was helpful to know we had extra support if we needed it.</p>

<p class="p6">We love the result. The super deep soaking tub is amazing and was absolutely worth the money. I love that, unlike with the previous bathroom, I’m not aggravated by the decor when I walk in. Long overdue indeed. We’re so happy we made the most of nearly two tough years and turned this bathroom into a peaceful haven we both love.</p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Remodeling a converted condo in Hoboken, New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We purchased our home in June 2020, a 1,100-square-foot condominium in a former 1800s schoolhouse. The downtown Hoboken, NJ building was converted into condos 30 years ago, and we love its character—our apartment has 24-foot ceilings with original wood beams.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are Danielle, an attorney, and Michelle, a human resources manager, and our plan was to move here with our two cats, Sylvia and Eleanor. We knew going into the purchase that we would renovate the kitchen and bath. Both needed a facelift. We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/67197" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project on Sweeten</a>, with accurate specs, and soon got responses from contractors interested in working with us. It wasn’t long before we found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5676#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a contractor we felt was a great fit</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our goals for the renovation were easy to convey, since the existing rooms’ shortcomings were obvious. The kitchen was closed off from the rest of the living area and outdated—we wanted to open it up and connect it to the living area. It was not only badly designed, but in poor condition, too. The cabinets were falling apart; we had to lift one of the doors with a foot to open or close the dishwasher. The bathroom was also in bad shape, with cracked tiles and water damage.</span></p>
<h3>A black kitchen, bold yet neutral</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wanted our remodel to be clean, modern, and simple, but still a statement. In 5 to 10 years, it should still look updated. We chose black cabinets and other features because they would stand out and look timeless. Neutral tones would complement decorative accents, and we like the clean feeling of white surfaces. We also wanted natural elements that would tie to the condo’s existing wood floors and warm up the space. We felt the palette would come together to create a modern, edgy vibe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04.jpg" alt="View of the renovated galley kitchen with open shelving and globe lights" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52151" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03.jpg" alt="Renovated kitchen with beige tile, black cabinets, and white marble counter" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52150" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our objectives in the kitchen included opening the room, increasing storage, and tailoring the cabinets and drawers to our specific needs. Seating would be added to the design to keep the cook company during dinner prep.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In planning the layout, the inclusion of base <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/semihandmade-cabinets-up-the-ante-without-the-pricetag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinets with drawers to maximize storage</a> was important to us. We wanted, too, to add a pantry, which the kitchen did not previously have; we managed to fit it in just right of the fridge. We were excited to find matte black cabinets—they look expensive but were more affordable than traditional cabinets, and almost as customizable. Plus, they’re made from recycled plastic! The wooden floating shelves add not only a natural touch but easy-access storage for dishes and glasses.</span></p>
<h3>Creating a home baker&#8217;s kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The plan also included new appliances and we decided to splurge on a high-end package. Danielle is an avid baker and successfully jumped on the sourdough bandwagon when the pandemic began—she loves being able to preheat the oven from her phone. We were set on a full-size fridge with an ice maker. We also fit in the world’s smallest wine refrigerator, at about six inches wide. We don’t drink much but love to have a few cold bottles on hand—this fridge holds seven.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the bathroom, we wanted to go simple and coordinate with the kitchen. We wanted the space to feel connected, and to that end, we kept to a similar neutral color scheme and same tile shapes. We installed a glass shower, knowing that the transparent walls would make this space feel bigger. In any case, we already have a tub upstairs. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went with a statement wallpaper</a>. We thought it made sense to go playful in the small bathroom. </span></p>

<span class="s1">What we did participate in was shopping for all of our materials, creating our vision and the end result!</span>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Managing during the home remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As first-time renovators, we were unsure about the timing of various phases and what the overall costs would be. We talked about when the materials, which we sourced on our own, needed to come. During the renovation, w</span><span class="s1">e retreated to Danielle’s parents’ home in Arizona. The condo is an open loft and isn’t conducive to phone calls—we didn’t think it would be possible to live, work, and renovate from home.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">What we did participate in was shopping for all of our materials, creating our vision and the end result!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was hard not being able to see the project’s daily progress, and to step back from our inclinations to micro-manage. But we did. We communicated our choices and concerns to our Sweeten contractor, from afar, usually over texts or on phone calls. Our contractor was patient and sent pictures as progress updates. Along the way, we learned the importance of communicating—ask questions and tell your contractor what you want, as you are your best advocate.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since we had a great relationship with our contractor, and we made all of the budgetary and design decisions, we didn’t end up needing to use some services Sweeten had to offer. Still, we were grateful for the match with a contractor we knew was vetted. We felt peaceful knowing that Sweeten had our back if an issue were to arise.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Tips on staying on budget</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we had one piece of advice to share, it would be about the budget. Figure out what your limit is—the one that you can actually afford. From there, expect a few unexpected costs. Go through your projection line by line with your contractor and be clear about what isn’t included in their quote. If money is a concern, pick a few pieces you’re in love with to splurge on and go for more affordable options for everything else. We paid about $50,000 for both rooms, all-inclusive of work and materials. We went for the pricier appliance package, which cost about $8k.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s such an incredible feeling to transform a space into exactly what you want and what you need. We’ve never experienced that before. We now understand the appeal. Amazing! At home! It was worth every penny.</span></p>

<h3>A fashionable—but not functional—period kitchen</h3>
<p>The kitchen was original from the 1930s and very Hollywood Art Deco. It was just one aspect we loved when we purchased our 1,400-square-foot co-op, located in a 1932 Spanish Revival building in Historic Filipinotown, a neighborhood near Los Angeles’ Echo Park.</p>
<div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" title="country-cottage-kitchen-butcher-block-countertop" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="white country cottage kitchen with patterened floor tiles and butcher block countertop and golden oak cabinets after renovation" width="1000" height="750" class="alignnone wp-image-51355 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-01-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-01-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Matt and I previously lived in a 600-square-foot apartment and never spent days hanging at home—it just didn’t have enough light and space. Looking for our next place, we realized that everything in our price range needed a large overhaul, or had been cheaply flipped and had an ugly poorly-designed kitchen.</p>
<h3>Seeking a fixer-upper kitchen</h3>
<p>I love to cook, and during our search, we’d decided that the sweet spot would be a place that was in good shape and had character but <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">needed a new kitchen</a>.</p>
<p>As first-time renovators, we figured the hardest parts would be finding a contractor, negotiating bids, and avoiding surprise hidden costs. When we found <em>the one</em> on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, it turned out our biggest challenge was actually <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not hiring an architect or designer</a> as well. I sketched the kitchen out on my word processor!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="golden-oak-cabinets-farmhouse-sink" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="golden oak kitchen cabinets with butcher block countertop and undermount farmhouse sink and white backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="750" class="alignnone wp-image-51359 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="undermount-farmhouse-sink-white-backsplash" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen windows over undermount farmhouse sink with black faucets and wooden countertop and white backsplash tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1333" class="alignnone wp-image-51366 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12-600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Thinking we would <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re-do the kitchen</a> right away, we purchased an induction hotplate and set it on the beautiful black-and-teal tile countertop. We found a basic fridge on Craigslist. We would also need to upgrade the unit’s electrical panel; we didn’t have the amps to run the hotplate and toaster simultaneously. When we first moved in, a kitchen wall had to be ripped out due to a leaky roof. It stayed that way until the renovation; it was rough in there!</p>
<h3>Flooring material for wet spaces</h3>
<p>We thought about trying to save the Art Deco details, especially the original tile countertops and the matching backsplash. But preserving the original aesthetic wasn’t an option. The counters weren’t the modern standard depth, so new appliances would not fit. We struggled with whether to go with deco tiles and white cabinets or scrap all that and let it be something modern. We went with the latter.</p>
<p>Going from the ground up, we discussed adding hardwood or cork flooring for a soft surface underfoot but decided against it. We wanted to make the kitchen contiguous with the laundry room, and we chose cement tile flooring to avoid worries about moisture. Another draw had to do with dirt. In our old apartment, we’d had terracotta tiled floors, which we loved, but the wide grout collected grime. The cement tile required narrower grout and seemed practical. It also brought a bold texture to our floors.</p>

<h3>Plywood cabinets and cement floor tile ground the kitchen</h3>
<p>Having ruled out natural wood for the floors, we were excited to use it for the cabinets. We feel intuitively drawn to wood and have chosen it for surfaces throughout our home, so we let that lead us. We went with plywood kitchen cabinets—it&#8217;s a cost-effective material, and we liked its functional aesthetic. Designing the layout for the custom base plywood cabinets was gratifying. Since we could dictate all dimensions, we spent time going over all of our kitchen wares and deciding how we wanted to store things. We’d measured the height of the coffee grinder and Chemex pitcher and knew which drawer they would live in long before the kitchen was built.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span>&#8220;Throughout the process, our Sweeten contractor was very communicative, which was lucky.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>We thought a lot about the upper cabinetry, too. We initially felt nervous about open shelving, thinking everything would get dusty. But in the end, we did it, mainly to save money, and it turned out to be a great choice to keep the visuals simple and open. It makes putting away dishes a breeze!</p>
<h3>Personalized features make it home</h3>
<p>The backsplash was also cost-contingent. We kept saying we’d do subway tile to save money—but decided on handmade, natural clay tiles that look so right with the plaster walls. Plastering the hood was another important detail for us; it became a way to draw the co-op’s original character into our modern design.</p>

<p>We didn’t agree on everything. My uphill battle was to convince Matt to spend the extra money to put in taps for filtered and boiling water. As the cook of the house and the one who drinks the most water, I felt strongly that this would pay off in convenience. Matt finally agreed, and it really has.</p>
<h3>Finishing touches for the laundry</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laundry room was another area</a> where plumbing was key, and our Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor got involved</a> there, too. We’d installed cabinets ourselves above the washer and dryer before starting the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen renovation</a>. However, the washer and dryer, which were included in the house purchase, had exposed hookups. We upgraded by having the contractor recess them into the wall. The dryer had been vented through a hole in the floor that looked like it was cut with a Sawzall, so we finished that, too. We invested in an on-demand hot-water heater and installed an $85 utility sink. Someday we’d like to get front-loading machines and put in a countertop to really pull that room together.</p>

<h3>Good communication with their general contractor</h3>
<p>Throughout the process, our Sweeten contractor was very communicative, which was lucky. When little things went wrong, he was <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">determined to fix them</a> and make us happy. We are grateful to the Sweeten team for helping us find him! We spent just <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under $56,000</a> on the whole project. I’m not sure we could have pulled it off had we not both been creative managers, but it was worth it to have a kitchen we designed exactly for ourselves.</p>
<p>The renovation has <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made our home livable</a> in a way we could have never foreseen. After being over budget and tired of eating out, it kind of worked for us that eating out had become less appealing. We got to stay home and cook.</p>

<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowners Sarah and Eddy</span></em></p>
<h3>Creating unity within a floorplan</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah, a managing director at an international nonprofit, WaterAid, and her husband, Eddy, a medical consultant, thought their co-op in Washington Heights, New York, was ideal for raising their two daughters. They loved the location, near Fort Tryon Park, and the design aesthetic of their 1939 Art Deco building. The problem? An outdated kitchen that had been (seemingly) randomly renovated over the years, with one section updated at a time. It resulted in what Sarah called a “hodgepodge” layout and design. </span></p>
<div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall, it was dark and dated,” said Sarah. “The cabinets seemed to be original, but we don’t know that for a fact, but they sure looked like it.” The couple also desperately needed more counter space. “There was more space for dining than food prep,” commented Sarah.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49323 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="Image of galley kitchen looking through dining room into entry" width="800" height="1200" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-05.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3>Finding an aesthetic to compliment the room</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, there were two windows in the kitchen. Cabinets completely blocked one window, so it wasn&#8217;t functional. By rearranging the layout, the homeowners were able to expose the window, adding more natural light to the updated kitchen</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="subway-wall-tiles-with-floating-shelves"  class="alignnone wp-image-44438 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with subway tiles on walls and marble countertop with farmhouse sink and stainless steel appliances and floating wooden shelves after renovation" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-04.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm was amazing! Both our designer, Ally, and our project manager, Petar, were like on-call doctors,” said Sarah. “They helped me with decision-making around all things—from what size appliances to buy to practical storage ideas.” Sarah and Eddy decided to keep the original floors to give a nod to the origins of the building. The kitchen received new cabinets, countertops, and appliances.</span></p>

<h3>Using the houses original walls</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they gutted the kitchen, they found beautiful brick walls hiding behind the sheetrock. The brick became a focal point behind a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/banquettes-seating-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newly added banquette</a> bringing a new texture to their streamlined, all-white kitchen. “The girls love to sit at the banquette and read while eating,” said Sarah. &#8220;And with an outlet installed in the banquette, it&#8217;s become a cozy work-from-home space during the pandemic.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, they kept the design simple and current with white cabinets and Calacatta countertops. Gray grout in the subway tile and the reclaimed wood floating shelves add contrast and personality.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="subway-wall-tiles-with-floating-shelves"  class="alignnone wp-image-44436 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-08.jpg" alt="white subway tiles on walls with floating wooden shelves and marble countertop after renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-08.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-SarahDobsevage-Kitchen-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<h3>Overcoming unplanned obstacles</h3>
<p>Necessary plumbing behind the kitchen sink left Sarah and Eddy with less cabinet depth to work with. As a result, they had to install a smaller than usual sink. Fortunately, in a clever workaround, to allow the sink to maximize the counter depth, the faucet was set off to the side.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49327 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-09.jpg" alt="Image of an offset kitchen faucet" width="800" height="1200" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-09.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;We love literally everything about our new kitchen,” said Sarah. “The countertops, the pantry, the counter-depth fridge&#8230;even the vent hood!”</p>

<h3>Remodel a basement bathroom for a welcome upgrade</h3>
<p>I love my Arlington Ridge neighborhood with its hilly streets and access to the metro, my favorite Mexican restaurant, and grocery store. When I found the 2,000-square-foot 1950s Virginia ranch home, I fell for the windows, cathedral kitchen, glass porch, and spacious yard. My older sister, Missy, deciding to move from San Francisco back to the East Coast, was a perfect excuse to renovate. She asked to use my downstairs as her temporary home.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48731 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="basement bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p>Before we renovated this (almost) windowless basement bathroom, it was creepy and unwelcoming. The shower had a horrible wall partitioning it off from the rest of the room. The door opened to a full view of the toilet. We never used it. I wanted an open-plan bathroom with plenty of light—a room that guests wouldn’t be scared to use when they visited me in Arlington.</p>
<p>I went into this as a first-time renovator. My biggest question was: Will it be a huge interruption in my workday? I work in business development, so I am on Zoom a lot. We posted our project on Sweeten and we could not have been happier with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woman-owned general contractor</a> we selected.</p>
<h3>Behind the not-so-pleasing wall</h3>
<p>When the contractor removed the wall, she discovered a very vintage pipe system that needed replacement. We looked for a plumbing specialist, and that search set us back a couple of days. Meanwhile, our contractor took the room down to the studs so the plumber could install new piping. The job involved breaking the foundation concrete, but even on days when the jackhammers were out or the water had to be turned off, we had advanced warning.</p>
<h3>Expanding the design palette</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48732" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="Arlington bath remodel" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>My Sweeten contractor made the job seamless and easy, even though what I initially envisioned changed dramatically. I thought I wanted the bathroom all white and clean but decided instead to let this room give the downstairs character. When she proposed the sliding glass barn door as a shower enclosure, I was sold.</p>
<p>The vanity is another fantastic piece, not only for its look but for the storage it brought to the room. I never would have guessed I would <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pick the gray shower floor</a>, but it all came together and it works.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span>&#8220;My contractor was really helpful&#8230;providing the right resources and materials. I understood what to expect throughout the process&#8230;&#8221;</span>

<h3>A beautiful result, and a satisfying experience</h3>
<p>I wanted a modern bathroom to match the rest of the house—and my future renovation plans—and I really lucked out. My contractor was really helpful, connecting with my sister and me and providing the right resources and materials. I understood what to expect throughout the process, and we are both so happy with how the bathroom turned out. Missy, a former tech executive, now works as a startup advisor. She is really enjoying the new digs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48727 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Image of bathroom vanity sink top" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Throughout the process, my contractor’s crew was amazing. My one-year-old beagle, Callie, would shake with excitement when they arrived, play for ten minutes, and then allow them to work. She returned throughout the day to check progress and get head scratches.</p>
<p>My Sweeten general contractor answered my questions, updated me on changes, and discussed any challenges. The team was respectful of my space, too. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">covered the downstairs areas</a> to keep them as clean as possible and left the workspace tidy. I scored with a respectful and professional contracting group that made my rip-and-replace renovation run smoothly, even as I worked from home. I always knew what to expect the next day.</p>

<h3>After a remodel, a basement bathroom has real appeal</h3>
<p>Missy’s gorgeous bathroom is now my favorite thing to show off in the house. It inspired her, too. She recently sold her house and is thinking about where she—and her Aussiedoodle, Ellie—should buy next. New, modern, and clean&#8230;what an upgrade.</p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Erica</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to believe a wall can have such a profound impact on how two people share space. Our kitchen, once barely big enough for one person, was transformed into what kitchens are meant to be: the heart of the home. Our 800-square-foot Clinton Hill apartment was a loved space, in every sense of the word. My then-fiancé, Joshua, moved in and we decided to renovate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before Joshua joined me, I imagined what would happen if the wall between the living room and kitchen came down. Now that it was two of us, changes seemed necessary. Along with the wall, Joshua also dreamed of replacing the parquet floors with hardwood. (I much preferred parquet so those conversations often ended in agreeing to disagree.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our apartment and all its quirks and beauties were familiar. We knew how we used the space, and which areas needed to become a better fit. We had a<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> budget for the kitchen</a> and vision. But who could we trust to help us move forward with our ideas? Just choosing the right paint color felt overwhelming, so finding the right designer was a challenge. </span></p>

</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten.com, and selected a firm with design/build services. The general contractor was familiar with the</span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clinton Hill Co-ops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the complexities that exist in these apartments, which were originally constructed in the early 1940s. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44832 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that first warm fall evening, she sat in our living room and listened carefully as we described what we hoped our home would be. We knew we wanted to remove a wall, upgrade the contractor-grade cabinetry, replace the appliances, and install under-cabinet lighting. But we were unsure of the process and the things we could not see. After talking, she immediately popped up and put her superhero design tools to work—her x-ray vision which saw through walls, and her tape measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial sketches removed the wall between the kitchen and the dining area completely, as well as part of the wall between the kitchen and the living room. We were seeking to strike a balance between Joshua’s partiality to completely open spaces and my desire to keep some visual privacy. Receptive to our decision to keep the entire wall between the living room and kitchen intact, the plan removed only the wall between the kitchen and the dining area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our contractor’s keen eye helped us ask so many more questions about the space. I never noticed that the sightlines of our parquet floors were uneven and misaligned. (Joshua was right. We needed to replace the floors.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="tile backsplash" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22219" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized that the space would be transformed in ways I was not expecting the moment she began to speak of light from the kitchen window spilling into the back corner of the living room. With the wall down, of course, the kitchen window would be visible as you enter the apartment. The decision to move the refrigerator out of the original kitchen footprint into what was once a hallway closet provided more options on where the sink and dishwasher could be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew that our Sweeten contractor had expertise in millwork. Our kitchen, filled with unexpected nooks and crannies, was a design dilemma that custom cabinetry could solve. I envisioned white cabinetry to brighten up the kitchen, and we trusted our contractor’s desire to include natural wood via open shelving and some cabinetry with a walnut finish. The shelving she created is the perfect platform for us to display our spices, cookbooks, vases, and the all-important pilon for grinding plantains.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. “I’m so nervous,” I admitted.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a designer, she not only considered ways to bring more storage and surface area into the kitchen, but also a new hue. One afternoon we perused our choices at their warehouse in Queens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every tile seemed to fall short—wrong tint, incorrect size, too dominating, etc. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then Joshua’s eye caught a simple hexagonal tile of soft turquoise blue. This 3D recycled glass tile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complemented the cabinetry color, the wood finish, and it was the right size. The result is a beautiful canvas that pulls the white cabinetry and quartz countertops together. Last, but certainly not least, it serves as a surprising showcase for my favorite red cast iron Dutch oven.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making decisions was easy. Rather than ask us to look at every iteration of countertop or knob, our contractor presented us with a few options, and the design sensibility connected across the space. The nickel handles on the cabinet doors pick up the subtle specks of silver accents in the quartz countertops coordinating well with the steel appliances.  I only noticed it once the kitchen was complete. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to come up with secondary plans for overhead lighting since the ceiling was made of concrete. The</span><a href="https://www.cb2.com/"> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">floor lamp now illuminates our favorite round dining table. The gooseneck sconce creates the perfect corner for working on a laptop at our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/">kitchen peninsula</a>, which can now accommodate someone cooking at the same time. The peninsula also has generous storage on two sides—four very deep drawers and a small cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, when you walk into our apartment, three things jump out at you: the welcoming natural light that flows in from the windows, rich wood elements on the cabinetry and shelving, and the turquoise tile of the backsplash.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44834" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The builders and carpenters of our design-build firm are true craftspeople. The care with which they handled each task was notable. They produced perfectly mitered corners, laid the floor with precision, and cleaned up at the end of each day. We felt like we were in good hands the entire way through. I’d notice an imperfection, and before I could say anything, they had fixed it. Truly top-notch workmanship. They were so thoughtful about the space that it made our decision to stay in the apartment throughout the renovation easy. “Just think of it like camping,” Joshua said one night as we dined in our bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. “I’m so nervous,” I admitted. &#8220;Don’t worry,&#8221; she warmly replied. &#8220;You’re gonna love it.”  Debris and concrete walls filled much of the living area after the first demolition day, but we felt the homeyness of the space. The light from the newly visible window greeted us as we entered in a way we never expected. I looked at Joshua and said, “I didn’t realize how much of me was in this place. Now we get to create this space together.” We couldn’t relish it more!</span></p>

Ditch a clunky layout. Add a kitchen island. And do it before the baby arrives. Those were Tara and Brian’s four main renovation goals after they bought a two-bedroom co-op (with a small office space) in Park Slope, Brooklyn. The prewar apartment was an upgrade in space and number of bedrooms from their previous rental as the couple prepared to start a family.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40338 mt-24 size-full" title="family portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40323 size-full" title="kitchen before renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01.jpg" alt="kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40332 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">It’s a shallow pantry, but it is enormously useful.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>However, it was outdated. Oak cabinets in the kitchen and patterned tiles in the bathroom, all from the &#8217;90s, made the room feel old. A kitchen peninsula awkwardly dissected the eating area and living room. The fridge took up prime real estate, blocking light from the apartment’s rear. “The previous owners had lived there for eight years and hadn’t really updated it,” Tara said. They decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted contractors, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-101/meet-the-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose a general contractor.</a></p>
<p>The couple decided to do most of the renovation before moving in so Tara, who was pregnant at the time, wouldn’t inhale any dust. Once the water was connected and the messy work complete, Brian and Tara took up residence while their contractor worked around them.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40337 size-full" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40326 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen storage and integrated refrigerator" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02.jpg" alt="kitchen storage and integrated refrigerator" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>For Tara, adding that <span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> island was non-negotiable and it turned out to be one of the crowning glories of the renovation. Their contractor had a reclaimed wood supplier in Pennsylvania and the couple picked out a big slab of walnut. They went for a rustic look, leaving two sides with a live edge and enhanced the wood’s cherry red tone with a lacquer. “<span style="color: #333333;">I remember when I was a kid, the kitchen island was the center of existence,” she said, adding that now when they have friends over, that still proves true.</span></p>
<p>Their contractor suggested a workaround for the refrigerator. The area already had three big clunky closets across from the main kitchen. Why not match those closets to the new cabinets in the kitchen and hide the fridge in there? It turned into a perfect solution that helped the flow of space between the living room, kitchen and the back of the apartment.</p>

The new kitchen layout had a few feet of wall space that wasn’t serving any purpose other than be covered in the white subway tiles Brian and Tara picked for their backsplash. The contractor saw the potential for a small pantry. When it’s shut, it looks like a tiled wall. But pop the magnetic doors open, and a 10-inch deep cabinet is revealed. “<span style="color: #333333;">It’s a shallow pantry, but it is enormously useful,</span>” said Tara. “Our friends think it is so cool.”</p>
<p>To create a sense of openness in the kitchen, Tara and Brian ditched the cabinets above the counter <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-shelves-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in favor of open shelving</a>. Their contractor used the walnut from the new kitchen island to create the shelving. The red proved the perfect accent of color and texture to the couple’s color palette of black and white.</p>

<p>Sticking closely to that color scheme, Tara wanted a darker stain with a matte finish on the wood floors. Brian thought it needed more gloss. “We spent a lot of time figuring out what stain to use,” Tara said. “My husband eventually came around.”</p>

Of everything in the renovation, making a decision on what <span style="color: #333333;">bathroom</span> faucets to install took the most time. Tara wanted something modern and functional. Brian had a strong view that it should have one handle instead of two. In the end, they found something “that we both didn’t hate,” Tara said.</p>
<p>She also felt strongly in favor of a glass partition rather than a shower curtain, “to make the space look bigger.” Brian pointed out the difficulties of maneuvering around a partial glass barrier when bathing their soon-to-arrive infant. To get on the same page on the glass, Tara volunteered to take the lead on baby bathing responsibilities. “At the moment she is still getting washed in the kitchen sink because it is so big,” she said.</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">If we thought creatively, we could make the most of all the space that would otherwise have gone unused.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The renovation hit a snag when their general contractor uncovered some serious water damage to the bathroom flooring. The couple had planned on keeping the original bathtub since they thought it was in pretty good shape. This new discovery meant they needed a new one. On the bright side, it gave Tara the chance to cross something off her “want” list: a bath with a tiled side.  “<span style="color: #333333;">Our contractor was very upfront with what was needed and what the cost would be,” Tara said, of the mid-project pivot. “He gave us options of what to do about it.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40331 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07.jpg" alt="study" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />The walnut wood turned into the gift that kept giving. After completing the kitchen, their contractor used the remainder to create three small shelves in the bathroom. With some wood still unused, he carved up more shelves for the <span style="color: #333333;">office</span>.</p>
<p>The renovation took three months to complete. During the project, Brian and Tara communicated often with their Sweeten contractor via text message and in person. “He was so great because we would text with him and he would keep us up-to-date even on minor details,” Tara said.</p>
<p>The couple also learned the art of compromise during the process. “Brian had to remind me of what was practical even if I really wanted something,” Tara said. But at the same time, don’t be afraid to get creative, she advised. The secret pantry behind a tiled wall and walnut shelving in the bathroom are two examples of making inspired decisions on the go. “<span style="color: #333333;">We realized if we thought creatively,” said Tara, “we could make the most of all the space that would otherwise have gone unused.”</span></p>

The room was closed off to the rest of the living spaces. The renovation plan was to keep the square footage the same so as to not disturb any architectural details with expansion. However, breaking through the wall for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/a-kitchen-pass-through-gets-social-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass-through breakfast bar</a> was the solution to open the space up to the living room.

For more convenient kitchen storage, a broom closet was transformed into a pull-out food pantry.

They instead used that extra space to take advantage of the room’s length and install lower cabinets all the way to the window wall. To make it feel even bigger, they opted for one long wood shelf opposite the wall of upper cabinets.</span></p><h3>Clever idea: shallow cabinets save space</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37242 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Inwood kitchen renovation, remodel, after, design, construction" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandra and Michael overhauled their </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/sustainable-remodel-inwood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing galley kitchen layout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to add more cabinet and counter space. They chose narrow base cabinets (basically wall cabinets) to save the square footage without making it feel more cramped.</span></p><h3>Relocating a bulky fridge frees up valuable space</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23887 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />In Hari and Kaity’s galley kitchen the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hari-kaitys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refrigerator placement</a> minimized counter space and the surrounding walls made the whole space tight. They relocated it to a spot a few feet outside of the kitchen walls. A cutout in the wall at the entrance also helped free up space. Pro tip: if you’re unsure about taking down walls, moving your refrigerator can be an alternative to free up space while preserving the existing layout.</p><h3>A galley kitchen puts dead space to use</h3><p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="galley kitchen with blue walls and granite countertops" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-28402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten homeowner Rashmi had no interest in an open kitchen when it was time to renovate.

To save space, shallower 18” kitchen cabinets were installed on one side. Closer to the entry, a narrow eat-in bar that was an extension from the countertop in the kitchen fit two stools. Opposite the bar, Rashmi installed built-in cabinets for storage and a washer and dryer.

The ideal distance between the two walls is four to six feet, which helps to maximize efficiency and workflow. Homeowners with smaller kitchens–meaning less than 90 square feet–would benefit from a galley kitchen layout.</p></div>

					<div id="elementor-tab-content-2642" class="elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix" data-tab="2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="elementor-tab-title-2642"><p class="p1">There are several ways to make a galley kitchen’s hallway-like appearance look bigger. First, using built-in refrigerators and dishwashers–which are only 24 inches deep–creates a seamless, flush line between appliances and cabinets. This eliminates protruding handles or edges. Second, choose your color palette wisely. Light-colored cabinets, like white, gray, and agave, make small spaces look bigger, as do glossy, reflective surfaces. Third, talk to a contractor about adding a pass-through window. These open up the space and allow for guests to mingle while the hosts prepare food. Lastly, look at the overall placement of your cabinets and appliances. Move bulky items, like fridges, away from the kitchen entrance as these can create visual barriers to the space and make it look smaller.</p></div>

<p>Often on the wish-list, islands are the perfect kitchen workhorse but don&#8217;t need to look so hard-working. The waterfall style gives this piece of furniture a finishing touch. From wood to concrete, here are seven ideas to pore over.</p>

			<h2>From wide-plank to herringbone, these popular hardwood floor patterns spice up any home</h2>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten renovation by Shana Sandberg of </span><a href="https://www.revelcraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #76808f;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel Craft and Design</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The popularity of using hardwood for flooring in homes dates back hundreds of years. Up to today, the material has proven to remain steadfast through time and trends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you choose geometric shapes like herringbone or chevron, or wide plank versus classic width, it anchors the whole home. Typically installed throughout, wood floors cover a large square footage. It has a substantial impact on your home&#8217;s personality and design style. No surprise, then, the perennial wood floor is often chosen for its unifying qualities and timelessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, Sweeten renovators show how their hardwood floor ideas added to their home overall. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches residential renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering know-how, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection—for free.</span></p>
<h3>A herringbone wood floor in Crown Heights</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3.jpg" alt="Cafe style dining area next to the door leading to the roof deck" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43646" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span><span class="s1">Janet and Jerry</span><span class="s2"> lived on Long Island but bought <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a multi-story fixer-upper in Brooklyn</a> as an investment property. Plus, it serves as a place to stay when they work late in the city. They updated the townhouse, keeping the small fourth floor as their own. For their one-bedroom unit, the goal was to create an open, airy studio. One of their pressing challenges was the hardwood floors. They were covered by old vinyl and carpeting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">They chose white-oak flooring that would be custom laid in a herringbone pattern. Unfortunately, the lead time was two months just to get the wood custom cut. So, they adjusted their plans and found a pre-cut herringbone wood floor that could be installed quickly. Their quick fix became a beautiful solution.</span></p>
<h3>Herringbone pattern wood enriches a kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25566" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Nazli and Larry<a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/"><span class="s2">, updating their historic Brooklyn brownstone</span></a> was a labor of love. They wanted to merge modern and traditional styles. The challenge wa</span><span class="s1">s how to do so within the townhouse’s long and narrow dimensions. The couple also struggled between managing their budget and getting their absolute must-haves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, some things Nazli wouldn’t compromise on. One was the wood floors. They wanted to make a statement in the kitchen so they splurged on walnut and installed it as a herringbone pattern. It gives the kitchen a rich, finished look, which extends into the parlor. To stay within budget, they used a less expensive white oak for the upstairs—an area that sees much less traffic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pro tip: There are a variety of wood floor species—all at varying price points. Oak, maple, and cherry are popular choices as well as bamboo, walnut, ash, and mahogany. Shop around to find the one that fits your budget and style.  </span></p>
<h3>Wide-plank wood flooring</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47439" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these Sweeten renovators, redoing </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their Greenwich Village condo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included gutting the place and adding a second bedroom. The plan was to maximize their 16-foot ceilings to make the 850-square-foot space larger and more modern. They turned it into a gallery-like space with black steel accents contrasting bright white walls. They kept the finishes simple giving an airiness to the space. One major design detail that achieves this is the contemporary-looking wide-plank wood flooring in a neutral stain. The home became more open, expansive, and refreshed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro tip: By definition, a wide plank is wider than today’s standard 2½– to 4–inch boards. And they are believed by many to increase property value due to their current popularity and relatively expensive price.</span></p>
<h3>Wide plank flooring in white oak</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49428" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working from home was the reason for moving into their 1950s home in Los Angeles. Like a lot of people who found they needed a home office during the pandemic, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy and Kevin needed a larger space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So the 1,538-square-foot house was perfect even if it was in need of a little TLC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They hired a Sweeten contractor to fix up the living room, kitchen, and bathrooms. But first things first. They started by laying down new flooring throughout the house. “We chose white-oak engineered hardwood in 8-inch planks to showcase the oak’s natural grain and make the house’s interior feel cohesive,” says Amy. And a bonus: The lighter floors compliment the living room’s natural wood ceiling.</span></p>
<h3>Classic wood floors in a Westchester County compound</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03.jpg" alt="living room with hardwood floors large windows and fireplace and track lights after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51202" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shana Sandberg of </span><a href="https://www.revelcraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel Craft and Design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came to Sweeten to help </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-westchester-county-home-remodel-turns-into-a-top-notch-family-compound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renovate her client’s home in Harrison, New York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The homeowners wanted to turn the 1953 estate into a convenient, multi-generational gathering spot for their family. The home needed an overhaul of the kitchen and bathrooms. The renovation plans also called for a new 750-square-foot addition to act as a large family room. The look of the home is contemporary classic brought together by the beautiful white-oak classic wood floors seen throughout. The homeowners chose variegated coloring to create a sense of refreshed modernity with a nod to the classic.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro tip: Variegated wood coloring and mixed-width patterns add versatility and work well with both classic and contemporary designs.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A classic tile gets a refreshing look</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to tile a kitchen backsplash or a bathroom wall, you can’t go wrong with the classic subway tile and its recognizable pattern.</p>
<div id="attachment_33958" style="width: 733px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/Ad71fKqfJIlRik7gSky2N3PncxrCB6miy2hpGyevQ1vFF8B8ZzonJyw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33958" class="wp-image-33958 size-chrono" title="subway tile" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2a712d8a94deb1565fabd54588a13289-2-723x857.jpg" alt="renovation, subway tile, kitchen" width="723" height="857" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-33958" class="wp-caption-text">(Image Credit: <a href="https://www.gretahollar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greta Hollar</a>,/span&gt;)</p></div>
<p>But what if you were to move those subway tile around like pieces of a puzzle? Suddenly that same subway tile shape takes on new dynamics. Here are seven ways to rethink this classic shape but with a fresh kick.</p>
<h3>Basketweave</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Clinton Hill home gains flexible space with sliding doors</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33864 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, open shelving, bar" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two decades ago, native New Yorkers Margery and Jim Fields worked in Manhattan and lived just outside the city. In 1996, the family relocated to Philadelphia when Jim was transferred for a job. The couple always had a special place in their hearts for New York, and when their kids grew up, they decided it was the right time to return.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33866 size-chrono" title="Margery and Jim" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-16-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NYC-Skyline.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34597 size-chrono" title="view" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NYC-Skyline-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34566 size-chrono" title="floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Floorplan-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they began their search for an NYC home, they wanted something a bit unique. They looked at many listings, but it was the view from their apartment at the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a> (a Brooklyn complex near and dear to us here at Sweeten, after renovating so many homes there!) that sold them on the one-bedroom place they ended up purchasing. They loved the sweeping view of Manhattan—the island that drew them back to the five boroughs.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33868 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-04-723x933.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33875 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-07-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33867 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, subway tile, spot lighting, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment itself was a different story. It hadn’t been updated in 40 years and had been chopped up with too many walls. Despite this, they decided that the incredible views were worth the trade-off of having to renovate. After a remodeling of their Philadelphia kitchen several years ago, they had a good idea of a wishlist for their next project. They wisely decided to live in the space for six months before starting the design process to get a feel for how they would use it—and to understand the light&#8217;s effect in the apartment at various times of the day. They heard about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, from their neighbors, and it kept coming up in conversation. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose this Sweeten contractor</a>, who had previously done several projects in the Clinton Hill Co-ops.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34564 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-05-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33869 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-05a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34108 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-05a-723x484.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, subway tile, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="484" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once discussions got underway, they made some decisions with the help of their Sweeten contractor; prior work in the building meant he knew what was behind the walls and what to anticipate, so was able to guide Margery and Jim on what actions would need to come next in the process. He knew the bathroom ceiling was a drop ceiling and would be able to install the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotlighting</a> they wanted. Their contractor was also familiar with the building&#8217;s wiring and informed them it would not support an induction cooktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple’s design vision was an industrial-yet-modern aesthetic. They wanted to take down the walls boxing in the kitchen and allow as much light into the space as possible. The full scope included a new kitchen and bath as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33873 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-04-723x933.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33872 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, hardwood floors, sliding door, french door, open shelving, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, Margery and Jim planned to convert the dining nook beside the kitchen into a second bedroom but ultimately decided on a flex-space solution made possible by sliding doors. When they didn’t need the second bedroom, the doors could remain open to take full advantage of the two large windows in the nook. The contractor created a custom solution by fusing two estate-sale-find French doors that Margery and Jim had found to make a sliding pocket door. The renovated nook is now a seating area that can be closed off from the living room to create a guest sleeping area that feels like a “studio within the apartment,” explained Margery. It is also a cozy spot for guests to perch when the pair entertain and are preparing food in the kitchen. (Given that Jim has seven brothers who are all married, they definitely need the seating for guests!)</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-03.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33876 mb-0 size-chrono" title="long-blue-kitchen-cabinet-peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-03.gif" alt="long blue kitchen cabinet with knob and white kitchen peninsula with cabinets after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the kitchen revamp, Jim and Margery decided on dark gray cabinets paired with a light quartz countertop and glass subway tile. The contractor suggested a full-length <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pantry</a> next to the refrigerator on the wall separating the kitchen from the living room, providing unexpected bonus storage. On the other side of the fridge, open shelving is built onto a mirrored backsplash for maximum light reflection into the kitchen. Corner shelving was added, with a Lazy Susan to maximize under-counter space leaving enough room for a full-size dishwasher.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple intended to add a kitchen island at first. But when they saw how open the space felt without it, they chose to leave it as is. Similarly, the original design called for stainless steel shelving to be added to the back wall above the sink but decided to leave it open for an airier feel overhead.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33882 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-06-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33881 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33879 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, bathroom, large-format tiles, vinyl tub, bronze penny floor tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Margery and Jim were able to make use of another estate sale find—the black large-format tiles, which cost a dollar a piece. They paired those tiles with an unusual bronze <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penny tile</a> Margery had once seen and admired in a restaurant. A cast-iron tub was swapped out for a vinyl one that allowed the contractor to bring the wall tile around the front to tie the space together. Modern Brizo fixtures helped to finish the clean, streamlined look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that their project is complete, Margery and Jim have a few words of wisdom for would-be renovators. They stress the importance of selecting the right contractor—one with whom you can have a good “communication cadence,” said Margery. “We would text or talk to our contractor multiple times a week, or multiple times a day as things came up. That ability to instantly communicate would keep things from being delayed or misinterpreted.” They love the openness of the new layout, &#8220;while keeping some separation between the kitchen and main living space,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;We&#8217;re glad we didn&#8217;t take out the bar/pantry wall.&#8221; Check out their Behind-The-Reno video below:</p>

<h3>Before: Give a Gramercy bathroom a much-needed facelift for storage, style</h3>
<p>Dated tile (“the bathroom looked like a 1980s Mafia movie!”) and no storage (“with a pedestal sink and no drawers or shelving, we didn&#8217;t even have room to store extra toilet paper”) drove homeowners Jessica and Kevin to finally renovate their bathroom. She’d been living in the 750-square-foot, one-bedroom co-op overlooking Pete&#8217;s Tavern, the oldest tavern in NYC, for seven years. Renovating the bathroom had been on her remodeling bucket list since day one.</p>

<p>After getting married, they used wedding money to fund their renovation, enthusiastic to update the aesthetics by losing the “burnt-red marble, gold hardware, and wall-to-wall mirrors” and adding storage solutions. Jessica <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose her Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>: A dramatic change resulted when white modern tile replaced the “heinous red marble tile” Jessica still has nightmares about. Their bathroom, which was trapped in an ‘80s vibe, became a calming, minimal space aligned with the couple’s style. The white and pale gray palette lent the former bathroom new life with a spa feel.</p>
<p>The couple replaced the “clunky” bathtub with a modern shower with two heads and switched to chrome fixtures. Next, they <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tackled their storage woes</a>. A console sink with open shelving for towels gave an airy illusion and contributed to the room feeling more spacious.</p>
<p>While designing their new bath space, Jessica was mindful of potential future buyers. She said, “When I bought the apartment, I found it very frustrating there were so many permanent fixtures, including a built-in glass shelf over the toilet, wall-to-wall mirrors, and tile covering most of the walls.&#8221; To give the next homeowners the room to express their own personal touch, she kept the walls painted instead of tiled, installed a mirror that could easily be replaced over the vanity table, and hung two simple towel hooks.</p>

<p>Jessica offered this sage advice, ”If you are purchasing your own materials for the renovation, have it arrive before the start date.” This will help <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">avoid waiting for products to arrive</a> and delaying the project.</p>
<p>Now Jessica calls her new bathroom a happy place and is appreciative of her well-matched contractor. “As with any NYC renovation, you tend to get a lot of complaints about uncontrollable things like dust and loud noise which comes with the territory of living in an apartment building. My Sweeten contractor handled everything like a pro and had much more patience for people than I ever could have exhibited,” she said. “He was extremely flexible and true to his word with regards <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to price and timing of the project</a>.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Jessica <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doubled their storage</a> by adding a two-drawer unit under the existing vanity table as well as a cabinet, creating a “personal heaven” she uses every morning to get ready for work.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: A <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14780#before" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rip-and-replace bathroom</a> in Yorkville, Manhattan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Deborah purchased this 1-bed, 1-bath co-op apartment and within a year, she could no longer live with the old, grimy tiles and outdated look, so she turned to Sweeten. Her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3531#references" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten design-build firm</a> went to work freshening up the space (she redid her kitchen as well; see results <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-pretty-entry-for-a-classic-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). The goal was to modernize the small space with new fixtures and finishes while retaining the original footprint. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t allowed to expand the existing footprint,&#8221; says Deborah, &#8220;because my co-op wouldn&#8217;t allow a &#8216;wet space-over-dry-space&#8217; rule.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they went to demo the bathroom, the contractor discovered that the waste lines were all sunk into the floor, rather than the walls, where they are usually found. They had to redo them all, which added an additional week to the project for inspections and approvals and an extra cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="off-white-bathroom-with-glass-door" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49097 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="Off white bathroom with glass door to tub and white vanity with oval sink after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: A calm color palette provides a serene spot to get ready for the day. White subway tile and a subtle gray paint on the walls are paired with a modern white floating <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> with custom pull-out drawers, which provides more accessible and usable space than traditional doors. The vanity, with ample storage, was a suggestion by her contractor and &#8220;meant I didn&#8217;t need a bulky medicine cabinet,&#8221; said Deborah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A metal grille cover was created for the radiator. A combination of white-plank <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-shelving-bathrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open shelving</a> and a glass shelf above the toilet provide plenty of display space for small toiletries. The Sweeten contractor also came up with the idea to add the paneling on the side of the bathtub for a classic look, as well as framing the window in white Thassos marble molding. Topped off with a frameless shower enclosure, the space is functional and beautiful, a major improvement from its predecessor. &#8220;My contractor was excellent with design,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am thrilled with my new bathroom.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Everyone loves a window in the bathroom, and the Sweeten contractor was sure to frame this one with a waterproof application that would keep the space watertight for years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A closed-in footprint cracks wide open with a floor plan change, a dramatic tile backsplash, and a new dining area</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Matthieu_Kitchen-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25802 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen with tile backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Matthieu_Kitchen-09-723x482.jpg" alt="tile backsplash" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</b></span>: Modernizing and improving flow in an awkward kitchen in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: This Sweeten homeowner purchased a two-bedroom co-op apartment in Clinton Hill about a year and a half before posting his project to Sweeten. Although the kitchen was functional, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layout</a> was not ideal. There was a mishmash of storage, none of which was adequate, and walls lacked definition without a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tile backsplash</a>. Only a small <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peninsula</a> provided the bulk of the work surface. He also wanted to add built-in <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinetry</a> for additional storage. With all of this in mind, the homeowner—a first-time renovator—enlisted <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Sweeten contractor</a> to convert his vision into reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>After</b></span>: A bright, contemporary kitchen in subtle tones pairs perfectly with a coral accent wall that runs along one side of the kitchen and through the living room. A glass tile backsplash in a mosaic of gray shades is the star of the show. By choosing stainless steel appliances, white cabinets, silver hardware, and a medium gray quartz countertop, the homeowner created a clean backdrop for both the tile backsplash as well as for it to coordinate with the home&#8217;s open plan. Given that the new base cabinetry—with many deep drawers—provide plenty of hidden storage, chunky white shelving was installed instead of upper cabinets for a feeling of openness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: By reconfiguring the kitchen from a U-shape to a galley setup, the Sweeten contractor made way for a dining space with an ample-sized table that easily seats 6 (or more!), and is directly in front of the kitchen’s large window to boot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Style finds</b></span>: Glass mosaic backsplash, white flat-front cabinets, gray quartz countertops, silver cabinet hardware.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you&#8217;re like most cooks, you have a medley of spice containers in your kitchen, including some duplicates because it&#8217;s easy to forget what you already own when out food shopping. Spice storage is becoming a frequent request</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">wall niches or built-in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinetry</a>—to <span class="s1">house these valuable ingredients. Those renovating have a prime opportunity to factor this into planning their kitchen layouts because </span>the last thing you want to do is fumble around for the paprika with a hot pan on the stove. To kick your spice game up a notch, here are 5 creative ideas from Sweeten homeowners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-15-16.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23716 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-15-16.gif" alt="spice rack for storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-apartment-gets-dose-luxury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabio and Melina&#8217;s</a> renovated kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After dealing with past kitchens that lacked storage, Fabio and Melina wanted their new kitchen to have plenty of it, especially since they both love to cook. Concealed pantry storage was built around the fridge and a pull-out drawer was added for storing spices. The spice drawer lives inside the upper lip of a much deeper drawer filled with baking essentials, maximizing the storage potential of the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23717 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="spice rack for storage" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Open shelving in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua&#8217;s</a> Sweeten kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Joshua’s kitchen, once small and cramped, needed to fit two cooks working side by side. The old kitchen was filled with unexpected nooks and crannies, a design dilemma that would be best served by custom cabinetry. To mix it up, open shelving was added, presenting the perfect solution for storing spices and cookbooks near the stove.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23718 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="Spice rack niche" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/tired-hudson-heights-home-reveals-stylish-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jessica and David&#8217;s</a> spice storage niche</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jessica and David decided to build a new closet along the wall separating their dining room from the kitchen so that they could use the dining room space as a bedroom in the future. Although the placement of the closet cut a chunk out of the kitchen, they were able to take back some of the lost space by carving out a niche with plenty of shelves for storing spices. As a bonus, the convenient storage also makes it easy for them to keep track of what they have in stock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23722 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="spice rack custom cabinetry" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Custom cabinet in <a href="https://sweeten.com/clintonhillcoops/ketrinas-sweetened-clinton-hill-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ketrina&#8217;s</a> Sweeten kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In building out Ketrina’s formerly tiny kitchen with new custom cabinets, bonus upper and lower units were added to the design to make better use of the space and hide some pipes. One such cabinet placed between the stove and the window was the perfect size to store spices, proving that every inch counts when it comes to boosting storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23723 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" alt="Pull-out spice rack" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Pull-out spice rack in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/newlywed-writers-turn-dark-kitchen-bestseller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda&#8217;s</a> Sweeten kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work-from-home writers Amanda and her husband cook often and wanted a kitchen in which they&#8217;d feel comfortable working in together. With a sizable collection of seasonings, a pull-out spice rack was added next to the stove and cleverly concealed as cabinetry, making it easy for both cooks to have what they need when the recipe calls for it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">From open shelves to a liquor cabinet with a garage-style door, these storage ideas can transform your kitchen (or closet!) into a fabulous home bar</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" title="white kitchen-recessed-lights"  class="alignnone wp-image-22989 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg" alt="white kitchen with recessed lights and white cabinets along with white door and knob after renovation" width="723" height="481" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When friends come over, the first thing you do is offer them a glass of wine. That means locating the bottle of wine before heading to where the glasses are usually stored. Finally, you root through the silverware and odds-and-ends drawers until you triumphantly unearth the corkscrew. Sound familiar? Rather than storing bar essentials around the kitchen, these Sweeten homeowners opted for home bar solutions to store everything from glasses to bottles of wine, liquor, cocktail shakers, and more. Plus, homeowners Yi Tyng and Maxime even transformed a closet located directly across from their kitchen into a wine bar (and it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/the-closet-as-workspace-bedroom-or-bar.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured in <em>The New York Times</em></a>). We’ll drink to that!</span></p>
<h3>Got an empty shelf niche? Add home bar hardware to keep stemware closeby</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22998 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-04" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/holly-kitchen-bath-renovation-greenwich-village/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holly and Christian’s</a> kitchen in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This clever use of niche shelf space is an excellent way to store wine, cocktail, and champagne glasses so that they can dry quickly and always be within reach for a celebratory toast.</span></p>
<h3>Floating shelves showcase stemware and spirits</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22996 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan and Mike’s</a> kitchen in Hell’s Kitchen, Manhattan.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Balancing a run of lower cabinets, a few open shelves act as a home bar dedicated to glassware and bar favorites make it easy to whip up drinks for company. And why not make it a home for cookbooks and cocktail recipes, too?</span></p>
<h3>Using slivers of cabinet space for bottle storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LKR_2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22990 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LKR_2-723x1089.jpg" alt="LKR_2" width="723" height="1089" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisa’s</a> kitchen in Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you have wine, one popular way to store the bottles is on their side so that the corks don’t dry out and let air in. A custom nook with grooved edges is the perfect solution.</span></p>
<h3>Stacking shelves above a wine fridge creates a home bar nook</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23118 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22" width="723" height="482" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frans and Dalal&#8217;s</a> studio kitchen in Gramercy Park, Manhattan.</p>
<p class="p1">Every inch in a studio apartment should be utilized to its full potential. By using the placement of the wine fridge as the base for a custom bar, these homeowners were able to add a countertop and shelving to store their home bar essentials and glassware in one easy-to-locate spot.</p>
<h3 class="p1">A cupboard under the stairs becomes space for spirits<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN-Wine-Bar.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23074 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN-Wine-Bar-723x964.jpg" alt="SWEETEN-Wine-Bar" width="723" height="964" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yi Tyng and Maxime&#8217;s</a> wine bar closet on the Upper West Side, Manhattan.</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">This closet, located under the stairs and directly across from the homeowners&#8217; galley kitchen, was transformed into a wine (and espresso) bar complete with open shelving, a wine fridge, and a counter with bar stools. The space also doubles as a breakfast nook.</p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">A garage-style door cleverly conceals cocktail-making gear<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" title="white kitchen-recessed-lights"  class="alignnone wp-image-22989 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg" alt="white kitchen with recessed lights and white cabinets along with white door and knob after renovation" width="723" height="481" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/katie-elliots-williamsburg-townhouse-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katie and Elliot’s</a> kitchen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have a larger collection, a custom bar cabinet with shelving for glassware and bottles can keep everything neatly organized. This one also boasts a sliding garage-style door so you can choose whether or not to display the goods based on your mood.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A one-bedroom in a coveted West Village condominium designed by famed architect Emery Roth offered a multitude of positives to a new Manhattan buyer: Impossibly desirable location, soaring ceilings, deep closets, residential amenities, and a quiet retreat for work or play. But this lovely home’s kitchen was relegated to a tight little galley, and though the finishes were once beautiful, the dark and heavy cabinetry blocked light and cut access to the living and dining rooms. Eric, the new owner, came to Sweeten to find a contractor who could smoothly navigate the management requirements in this pre-war building and bring a serious carpentry and craftsmanship approach to flow and finishes in the kitchen.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making real design changes to a pre-war pad can prove rather daunting &#8211; many of Manhattan’s most sought-after buildings have deep historical roots, celebrity architect imprints, and cautious alteration agreements that limit updates. Eric saw an opportunity to open up the kitchen in his new place and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his renovation project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten &#8212; we matched him with </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Alan</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a cabinet and millwork specialist who could also manage strict building requirements and oversee all aspects of the project.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For Alan, designing new custom cabinetry to lighten the space was the easy part. Finding a way to incorporate more natural light and reconnect the rooms was the primary challenge. Eric had hoped to take down the entire wall separating the kitchen and living room where the paneled fridge stood, but the building’s interior pipes stood in the way, so the crew decided to open the wall with a large pass-through instead. The team also planned to replace floors throughout the apartment and targeted the old-school linoleum in the kitchen as a starting point.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17057" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-Before-01-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alan stripped the black and white linoleum squares and laid white oak planks down in their place, finished with a glossy clear stain throughout the entire apartment. The cabinets were torn out and replaced with a detailed custom oak set, mostly constructed and completed onsite. Incorporating a lot of glass into the design, Alan created open, closed, and shelving variations in a combination of natural-stained and painted white finishes. The new pass-through provides light from the kitchen window and the living room windows in both directions, and Alan played up the new light with windowed display cabinets above the counter and bar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17049" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="manhattan galley kitchen" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make the partial wall and new footprint more functional, Alan moved the refrigerator to the adjacent wall and constructed a food pantry to mimic the rest of his oak cabinetry, finished with heavy metal hardware and pulls. Ivory Caesarstone countertops replaced black granite, and an undermount brushed stainless steel sink with matching faucet were installed. Because the kitchen’s back wall is so visible from the living room, the team went with a neutral, luminous glass-tiled backsplash and open shelving above the sink. New stainless steel appliances, including a hefty gas burner, contrast with the warm wood and are easy to keep clean. Alan took Eric’s vision for more light very seriously, adding a number of under-cabinet and recessed sources, as well as a striking ceiling fixture centerpiece. As a bonus, Alan constructed a bar counter on the living room side of the pass-through, perfect for open entertaining. </span></p>

Guest post by Corey, Williamsburg homeowner</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Burned out by a decade of renting in the city, we entered the buyer’s market with little knowledge of how volatile it would be. After a search that saw us move too slowly on a modest but well-located unit, and then get completely outbid on a dream apartment, we stumbled upon a two-bed, two-bath condo in Williamsburg. Not wanting to miss out again, we put in a bid and were surprised to get the place. That could very well have been the end of the story, but what fun would that be?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’d be the first to admit that the unit we purchased was totally serviceable. Only a few years old, it was a corner apartment with decent square footage and great city/bridge views in an increasingly popular zip code. The unit had been rented to a prolific painter who’d kept the walls white and the creativity high. It was a serviceable blank canvas; what it wasn’t was the dream apartment we’d lost out on months earlier. Regardless of how excited we were to be new owners, we just couldn’t shake the “if only&#8230;” feeling for that spot and started thinking about ways to incorporate elements from the coveted (but now somebody else’s) space into our new home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had no idea where to start, but after a search on New York renovations, I stumbled upon <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and spent a few days ghost-stalking various featured projects on the site. This gave me many ideas and the more we explored changes for our space, the bigger the scope of this potential project became, so we decided to focus on the area that could make the biggest impact: the kitchen. As it was, the apartment opened into a cramped one with little countertop space, limited storage, basic appliances, and no defined dining area. There was unused space above the cabinets and an odd mixture of lighting fixtures. In a nutshell, it was a cookie cutter kitchen in a cookie cutter condo and we really wanted something with more character.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13107" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE.png" alt="SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE" width="600" height="225" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE-300x113.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I put together a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project post on Sweeten</a> with a fairly clear idea of the feeling we wanted the place to evoke, even if the specifics weren’t totally defined. Sweeten introduced us to a few design teams and we decided to work with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Thomas</a> and his design/build team based on images of some of the spaces they had designed in Little Italy. We had them come out to the apartment to see what we had and right away, the team showed enthusiasm for the project and the type of aesthetic we were hoping to achieve. In hindsight, that was probably the most important decision we made &#8211; identifying the team that seemed to best understand the vision we had and showed a willingness to get us there (and stay within our budget) was key.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thomas&#8217;s team introduced us to their design/build approach and though I had no experience with the model, it became clear we would be working very closely to get the space just the way we wanted it. But what was that, exactly? Aside from being slight on storage and functionality, our complaint was that the kitchen was generic, so looking to the neighborhood for inspiration, we envisioned a design that embraced the industrial history of the area without being too rustic. We also wanted to maximize the space by creating a more open floor plan. Through conversations with the design team, we zeroed in on a classic palette incorporating white, gray, brown, charcoal, black, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Palette aside, there was little hope of gaining storage or making the space feel more open without a pretty drastic change to the layout. Thomas and his team walked us through possible reconfigurations; we entertained the idea of installing an island or lengthening the counter, but because of the central placement of the sink and dishwasher, the only way to address the problem was to relocate both. Cue the plumber. The upside? We were able to position the sink in front of the window (where it probably should have been in the first place?) and create a longer countertop surface as well as additional storage both above and below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They say the devil is in the details and we learned this firsthand once the floor plan had been chosen and the time came to fill it. We have an admittedly eclectic style so the conversations about materials were lengthy and the direction of the design changed a few times. We went in knowing we liked metal, glass, tile and wood because they suggested the “industrial” feel we liked, but it was most important that we assembled comfortable and clean materials. We knew we wanted appliances that would allow for entertaining and easy food prep and a look that would match, so a lot of time was spent narrowing down the colors of the tile and millwork and countertop and shopping for new appliances.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13110" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-03" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13109" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-02" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13108" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-01" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the design/build process, we were able to combine an <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA</a> pre-built cabinet base system with custom doors, buffed and polished to create a bespoke look &#8211; a color that did not exist before we requested it! We finished the cabinetry with hardware from <a href="https://www.anthropologie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthropologie</a> and found the backsplash tile at <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nemo Tile</a>. Thomas added open shelving repurposed from wood that his team sourced, and complemented the look with a decorative but spare hanging pendant from <a href="https://www.abchome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC Carpet and Home</a>. The dishwasher, range, and fridge are all <a href="https://www.vikingrange.com/consumer/index.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking</a>. We found the table and benches at ABC Home before we bought this place and love how they work here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many things about the design that I love, and each component is like a puzzle piece that connects to a memory. The feature that I still find the most exciting is the countertop. Once we knew we’d be relocating the sink, and nearly doubling the counter surface area in the process, I knew it was critical to choose the right material as it would be prominently featured. Thomas had shown us a space they were finishing with a soapstone countertop and we inquired about the possibility of doing that in our space. They were more than willing to help us make that work and took us out to their supplier’s stoneyard to look at slabs. While there, we saw the integrated countertop/sink configuration on display and were sold. We also opted for a “waterfall” edge which helped distinguish the kitchen/dining areas.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I would be lying if I said it was all completely painless, but as I look back, it’s obvious that every trial we ran across, whether it be plumbing surprises or tile irregularities or whatever, we chose a design firm committed to making good on our contract together. They were as invested as we were in seeing the space come out the way we wanted and along the way the team at Sweeten (Jean and Shera) were both very much in the loop and always asking how they could assist. I doubt I will embark on another renovation anytime in the near future but if I did, I’d certainly return to Sweeten and would recommend them to anyone looking to transform their home.</p>
