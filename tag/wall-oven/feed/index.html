										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When shopping for Manhattan real estate, you don’t always get what you want. For Gall, a patent attorney who grew up in Florida, an extended search for a new Manhattan apartment took him and his wife first across town, into an unexpected neighborhood, and subsequently through an impressive renovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23270 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-723x487.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="487" /></a><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gall was living in a Hell’s Kitchen one-bedroom with his wife Ingrid, a Brazilian-born speech pathologist. They initially discovered <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> when they began thinking about a renovation for that apartment. The makeover wasn’t to be, however, and they switched gears in anticipation of expanding their family. For the better part of a year, the couple shopped for a larger apartment in the competitive market along Broadway on the Upper West Side. It was only after widening their search across Central Park that they stumbled onto an affordable Upper East Side building “right on top of the subway,” he notes.<br />
</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23267 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan-543x668.jpg" alt="floorplan" width="543" height="668" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23269 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01-1-720x495.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01" width="720" height="495" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23263 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high-rise building was originally developed as a rental in the 1980’s, and Gall liked the way its bay windows amplified the view. The 1,280-square-foot unit had received mainly cosmetic renovations since going condo in the early 2000’s, so floors were a deep brown that showed dust and failed to bounce natural light around the space. The original kitchen measured 100 square feet, but felt cramped and closed-off, with a shortage of counter space. Gall, who is the family chef, recalls the well-used beige plastic laminate kitchen cabinets as being very small, and they didn’t go all the way to the ceiling. There was also insufficient storage in the bedrooms. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where they fit their clothes,&#8221; he says.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23381 size-chrono" title="Upper East Side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23272 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, it was a real estate broker’s recommendation which reminded Gall of Sweeten. He <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their remodel</a>, along with a wish list of some elements to add and others to subtract. After signing with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> that offered design and build services in April, demolition began in June. Their contractor worked with the couple for months, strategically updating the apartment while enhancing the expanses of space that had attracted them in the first place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One early target was a wide bank of awkwardly placed bui</span>lt-in bookcases ri<span style="font-weight: 400;">ght at the entrance. “It had tons of little compartments and really felt cluttered right there in the middle of the house,” Gall explains. They removed it and worked with their team to fill the same space with closed storage. A penthouse they saw while apartment shopping served as the couple’s design inspiration for cool mirror doors—on both their new pantry cabinet and the neighboring linen closet—that are decorated with a retro raised-panel design.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One unexpected (and technically challenging) concern was mentioned by the building architect. For the spot where they planned to open up the kitchen by demolishing a wall, the architect asked about a much discussed but often ignored code requirement for a drop soffit to channel smoke dividing the ceiling between the kitchen and living area. A reworked soffit satisfied the requirement and tied into the other new ones around the living room. To unify the apartment throughout, their contractor suggested </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they see an example of 5-inch-wide white oak floors in another project the team had completed; Gall and Ingrid instantly fell in love. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wood was glued down to the concrete subfloor throughout the living areas, and even in the kitchen. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23382 size-chrono" title="Upper East Side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23276 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23277 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span>he new kitchen has synthetic quartz for the countertops, as well as on the new island where the wall<span style="font-weight: 400;"> once stood. “By opening up the wall we lost a lot of upper cabinet space,” he explains, which made new full-height cabinets a necessity. The cabinets are white-painted maple, and the backsplash mosaic is a herringbone composed of glass and marble tiles. The couple skipped a range in favor of the flexibility of having a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-ovens-power-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall oven</a> and separate <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooktop</a>. The refrigerator, though not a pricey panel-ready model, is neatly integrated into a tall wall of white cabinetry. The cookspace was one of their favorite spaces. &#8220;The craftsmanship was amazing,&#8221; said Gall. &#8220;The huge countertop makes working in the kitchen a pleasant experience,&#8221; including enough space for him and his wife to cook together.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23278 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23279 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In t</span>he master bathroom, <span style="font-weight: 400;">a tub was replaced with a new stand-up shower with marble from Porcelanosa. Gall praises the three-dimensional renderings created by his Sweeten contractor, which were a great help for imagining the look of the kitchen. “We’re not visual people, and that made the process much smoother and easier.” </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23282 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14.gif 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14-300x200.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23281 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-12" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23280 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1.gif 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1-300x200.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The closet organization in the master bedroom was built to the homeowners&#8217; exact requests, not only providing more than adequate storage, but the cabinet doors matched the rest found in the apartment. For the nursery, the initial placement allowed the rest of the room to be furnished around it. &#8220;The closet was planned to accommodate two children at different ages,&#8221; says Gall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23350 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Upper east side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1-723x1058.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1058" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of the inconveniences, Sweeten clearly contributed immeasurably to the couple’s renovation. “We had been very nervous about getting the right contractor, one who wouldn’t walk out on us,” he recalls. He advises renovators to expect a longer period of construction than originally quoted, and to spend as much of your own energy on it as possible. Once you find an expert you can count on, he says, &#8220;trust your contractor&#8217;s opinion.&#8221; Mid-construction, they found out they were expecting a child, and the job was finished before the birth. Today, one of those spectacular bay windows in the living room, with its classic New York view, makes an ideal playpen for the luckiest of big-city babies.</span></p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Here’s a primer on this traditional appliance, but don’t be fooled—telescopic racks, smart technology, and French doors make it a modern kitchen helper</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">A wall oven is a very handy appliance in the kitchen, even if you already have one in your range. It doubles your ability to bake, broil or roast, especially important if you entertain frequently, like to cook ahead, or just want to host the holidays with more ease. What’s more, with a wall oven, you enjoy more flexibility with regard to placement, not only for its location in the cook space, but also height.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Wall ovens have seen a lot of advances since the last time you shopped. While you can anticipate the one you choose will operate more accurately and efficiently than previous models, you can also expect to find super-sleek styling, sophisticated digital controls to help you find just the right setting for everything, and of course, self-cleaning. Here’s a rundown of what to look for:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choose your heat source</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Probably your first decision will be gas or electric. Your choice will be based on the type of power you already have in your home. Most manufacturers still offer gas, which provides a lower-priced alternative to electric, and more of a moist heat. With electric, the temperature coming from the coils can be controlled more precisely than a gas flame, and heat is radiated from both top and bottom elements. Electric ovens may also offer Sabbath mode, which allows continuous, safe operation over several days without having to turn the appliance off and on.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Multiple sizes offer flexibility</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Unless you’re replacing an existing oven and so locked into specific dimensions, you have some flexibility here, too. While the most common width is 30 inches, many manufacturers offer 27-inch and 36-inch wall ovens, and you will find some at 24 inches as well as 48. Think about what and how you cook, as you need to consider the cubic-foot capacity, too. If you host the family Thanksgiving, you want an oven cavity large enough to handle that huge turkey. Sizes range from as low as 2 to as high as 5 cubic feet with an average about 4 cubic feet. A large turkey usually ranges from 24 to 26 lbs and can fit into a 30&#8243; oven with 5 cubic feet of interior space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Go convection</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Available in both gas and electric, a convection oven uses fans to circulate hot air within the oven cavity for faster baking and roasting, as well as the most even cooking. Your wall oven should be able to alternate between conventional and convection, as you wish, but some double ovens may offer one unit convection and the other conventional.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Don’t forgo convenience</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Who doesn’t want a microwave oven, even if it’s just for reheating soup or coffee? If space is an issue in your kitchen, consider a wall oven that includes a separate microwave, typically on top. It resembles a double wall oven, but not so tall.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cooking on the double</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In the ’70s, it seemed every kitchen (at least those on TV shows) had double wall ovens and a matching cooktop in avocado or harvest gold. While these color choices have been replaced by stainless steel or a return to classic white or ivory, the convenience of double ovens is worth examining. You get double the function, as mentioned above; while a single convection oven lets you cook simultaneously on multiple racks, a double oven permits simultaneous operation at different temperatures (great when you want the roasted Brussels sprouts to be ready at the same time as the broiled chicken, or to have a pie come out of the oven just as you are finishing dinner). It’s also cheaper than two individual wall ovens (unless you have, say, a kosher kitchen and need to keep the ovens in separate places). Just be sure to plan an adequate landing surface nearby to handle multiple hot dishes that may be ready at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stay low-maintenance</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">What did we do before self-cleaning came along? Perhaps this is where the term “elbow grease” originated. In the past, you had to remove the racks and clean them by hand. Check with your salesperson, as some models now allow you to leave the racks inside while cleaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Warming selection</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The warming drawer option first came on strong about 20 years ago, then interest tapered off as wall ovens hit the market with super-low heat and steam features that basically did the same thing. For households where family members eat at different times, or who often host a crowd, and for kosher kitchens, a warming drawer is still a handy appliance worth making room for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Other fun features</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Bells and whistles come at a price, but you may want to justify it for the added convenience, control, and safety (not to mention time) you gain. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">*Operation modes have expanded beyond self-cleaning to control lock, as well as delay start and cook and hold—terrific for busy lifestyles! Even the broil function offers some variability to adjust for foods with different requirements, like the golden brown bread crumb topping or the blackened seasoned sirloin steak.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">*Doors are making a statement, too. You’re used to grabbing the handle at the top and peering in while you dodge a blast of hot air to check the progress of your food, right? Manufacturers have responded to this practice by offering larger viewing windows. You can also find wall ovens where the door opens from the side, as well as French doors. A stylistic choice, they’re also ADA compliant, so you may also find it easier to access a dish inside with one of these types of doors (expect to pay a bit more).</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">*Investigate the racking systems. You’ll hear a term “telescopic,” which refers to a system whereby the rack extends fully with ball-bearing rack guides, to prevent tipping when removing heavy items.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">—</p>
