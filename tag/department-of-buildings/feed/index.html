<h3>Why the right general contractor is important</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating can be a complicated process. However, the more you know about working with a general contractor, the better prepared you’ll be. While these professionals execute the labor of your renovation, they are also a collaborator to your dream home. Their team will be working in your space for several months. Because of this, you really want to be confident in knowing how to hire a contractor<span>—the right one for <em>your</em> project</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten outlines the process—from what to look for, to the key responsibilities you can expect from your general contractor.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Do you need a general contractor or a handyman?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first step to starting your project is figuring out the scope of your renovation. Depending on the level of labor your project requires, you will either need a general contractor or a handyman (or DIY!). To decipher the difference, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are you hanging things on walls, or taking down walls?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are you re-grouting tiles, or replacing them?</li>
<li>Smaller projects to make repairs or patch-over errors are handyman-ready. On the other hand, large-scale projects that involve electric or plumbing will require a permit or inspection. In this case, a contractor with a state Home Improvement Contractor (HIC) license will be obligatory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining labor for your renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For first-time renovators, figuring out what kind of labor is required for the project can be hard to determine. If you live in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-op</a> or condo, your alteration agreement may provide guidelines when hiring a general contractor. In other situations, checking your city’s Department of Buildings will offer information on the types of projects that require a permit. <strong>The most important thing to remember is that cutting corners with unlicensed workers is never worth the risk. </strong>It often leads to homeowners needing to pay extra to fix unfinished, subpar, or non-permitted work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doing the research to determine if you need the services of a general contractor is a crucial step in getting your project off the ground. Then the next step is finding the best contractor for your job.</p>
<h3 class="p1">How to hire a contractor suited to your project</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the process of interviewing and hiring a general contractor, start by looking for someone with experience in your neighborhood and who has done similar work. This can help you narrow down the field from thousands of general contractors to just a handful of experienced professionals. Keep these questions in mind as you search:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Has the contractor done work in your neighborhood?</li>
<li>Has the contractor done similar work to what you’re looking to get done?</li>
<li>Can the contractor provide quality references and photos of past work?</li>
<li>Is the contractor licensed? (Working with an unlicensed contractor isn’t worth the risk!)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask to see some of their past projects in person or to speak to their past clients—at least two. General contractors in Sweeten&#8217;s network have completed transformational renovations with past clients who are still happy with the work years later. This indicates that the contractor&#8217;s work has held up over time. <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten matches homeowners</a> to a selection of contractors based on location, budget, scope, and style for the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you&#8217;ve found someone you think would be a good fit for your project, take it one step further and make sure they’re a good fit for you. You’ll be working with this contractor for the duration of your project, so you should feel compatible! Here&#8217;s what to look for:</p>
<h4>Are they communicative?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you can trust your contractor to be responsive throughout the entire renovation process. Both parties will need to be on the same page, especially in terms of timeline.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is it a good fit personality and style-wise?</h4>
<ul>
<li>First impressions do matter! The contractor should be able to understand and carry out your particular sense of style. Additionally, with the amount of time they’ll be spending in your home, look for someone who meshes with your personality.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Do they have recent and reliable references?</h4>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s important<span style="color: #333333;"> to review </span>recent references for similar projects that your contractor has completed. You should be aware of the level of satisfaction of past clients. At Sweeten, our contractors have profiles that highlight past projects and client reviews to help you decide.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What does a general contractor do?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your general contractor manages your project from start to finish, focusing on the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Obtain proper licensing, insurance, and additional documents required by city, state, and specific to building needs</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Review site conditions and all relevant documents and drawings in order to fully understand the project and generate a proposal and bid (the proposal is the plan and the bid is the proposed cost)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Specify the final scope of work, and schedule, and come up with a contract</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Define the payment and deliverables schedules</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Request and follow advice from the architects, engineers, or design team</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Manage and coordinate general aspects of a project, like site requirements</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Provide skilled labor, tools, equipment, and various services</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Coordinate subcontractors and other trades required by the scope of work and oversee the quality of their work</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Maintain schedule and communication with clients</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Review project completion with the client and final payment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asking general contractors for estimates (at least 3)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A contractor will partner with you to decide on:</p>
<ol>
<li>The final scope of work</li>
<li>Materials</li>
<li>Timeline</li>
<li>The best form of communication, and how often they should check in with you</li>
<li>Budget and payment schedule (make sure you have everything in writing)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sweeten recommends getting 3-5 estimates from contractors to see where the price range falls. This also allows you to experience the different personalities and communication styles of the contractors. Who do you have the best rapport with? Who do you feel the most comfortable with? These factors will play a big part in your decision when hiring a general contractor.</p>
<h3>Understanding estimates from general contractors</h3>
<p>Bid leveling is a crucial step that will allow you to break down and compare the services the contractor can offer at each price point. This occurs once you have received estimates, or bids, from contractors.</p>
<p>For example, one contractor who gives a higher-priced bid may provide more individual services, like answering questions on the weekend or putting a mood board together for you. A comparative breakdown of the bids will reveal a clearer picture of what services you want as a renovator.</p>
<h4>Sweeten offers free bid-leveling services to homeowners</h4>
<p>New to renovating and unsure how to read bids? Sweeten provides a free bid-leveling call to all homeowners who use the service. Read all about Sweeten&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/bid-leveling-call-for-renovation-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid leveling and estimate comparison call.</a> (You can also read up on this process with Sweeten&#8217;s guide to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid leveling</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you meet the contractors during site visits, be prepared with a list of questions to ask. Do not be afraid to speak up about what you want! That being said, be open to a contractor&#8217;s ideas and suggestions. The licensed contractor is a professional with a wealth of knowledge about construction and years of experience. This is their specialty, and they likely have answers to all of your questions.</p>

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-renovations-fools-gold-retail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fool&#8217;s Gold renovation</a> by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Sweeten general contractor</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a business owner, once a business plan and financing are ready, and a space for your office, <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/cost-breakdown-restaurant-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restaurant</a>, or retail space has been identified, the next crucial step is understanding the commercial lease itself. Having the right team—a commercial real estate broker and an attorney—who specializes in negotiating leases for commercial spaces will help advise what should be included in the lease document to protect you and your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractors, consulted the experts to define these elements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, a landlord provides the first version of the lease, which will (obviously) favor the landlord and is often derived from a template. Oftentimes, the landlord will use a template. Commercial real estate broker with Compass, Alex Cohen, explains, “The commercial real estate advisor negotiates all the key business terms on behalf of a tenant before a lease is prepared or an attorney is engaged by the tenant. Once a lease is drawn, the advisor can confirm all of the agreed business terms are accurately conveyed in the lease and can assist the attorney in the negotiation of legal terms.” While the lease should include everything previously discussed in the term sheet, your attorney should perform a close review, checking that you are clear on the terms and making any necessary adjustments so that the lease is more favorable to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Something to keep in mind: There are important differences between residential and commercial agreements. If you are familiar with residential leasing, you may make (incorrect) assumptions about commercial leases based on that experience. One major difference is that residential renters have rights under the law—to heating and repairs, for example. In a commercial tenancy situation, the landlord does not have to provide heat or make repairs unless it is stipulated in the lease. Read on for the specifics of what is typically included in a commercial lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Base rent, steps, and escalations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rental amount on a commercial lease is calculated via several variables. You are responsible for a base rent, which is the minimum amount of rent you pay. This is often calculated on a yearly basis and based on the rent per rentable square foot, a term explained below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For office tenants in New York, the square footage for which a business pays rent can be 30% to 40% greater than the square footage on which carpet can be laid and furniture installed. Rentable square feet for <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/office-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">office space</a> is usable area, plus a portion of the common areas adjusted by a market loss factor. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-guide-retail-renovation-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retail space</a>, however, is generally marketed and leased on a usable square foot (the actual square footage of space that is available to the tenant for its business use) basis. Loss factors are higher for partial-floor office spaces than for full-floor occupancies, because common areas like corridors, elevators, and lobbies are apportioned on divided floors into each tenant’s square footages. This means full floors are usually more efficient and cost-effective than partial-floor occupancies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to fixed increases in the base rent—typically every five years and referred to as &#8220;rent steps&#8221;— various mechanisms (“escalations”) exist that adjust the rent to be paid by the tenant during the term of the lease. Landlords want to ensure that they will continue to generate profit and will want the tenant to bear at least part of the responsibility for increased operating costs and higher taxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Additional rent for utility charges and services</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In New York City, base rent does not usually include electricity service. Utilities are usually charged by submetering, or through rent inclusion (though if you are fortunate, your space will have a separate meter and you pay the actual cost of electric usage directly to Con Edison). If your commercial space is not individually metered, you will have to buy electricity from the landlord, who usually marks it up. In submetering, you will pay a monthly electric charge (plus markup) to your landlord. With rent inclusion, the landlord includes a fixed charge for electricity lumped onto the rent, calculated per rentable square foot. This is a prime area for negotiation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other utilities such as water, gas, and heat, may be included in the rent or sub-metered. Typically this is decided based on building configuration and usage—if it is low, the landlord is usually happy to include it in the rent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also note that if the utilities are shared in the building, the landlord is only responsible for providing the utilities in the hours stated in the lease. For example, if you need to use the heat after hours, you may have to negotiate that separately and pay additional after-hours charges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another area of consideration is cleaning services for your rented space. There are typically three options: 1) landlord includes the service as part of the rent; 2) landlord has a preferred vendor who you pay out-of-pocket; or 3) you obtain cleaning services on your own (or clean the space yourself!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Terms of the lease</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In commercial real estate, a “short-term” lease is considered anything under five years, whereas a “long-term lease” is anything longer than five years and often for a 10-plus year period. You will decide what kind of lease works for your business based on how stable it is, and how long you think the location will work for your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In tandem with the length of the lease, also pay close attention to the assignment and subletting rights. If you need the flexibility to assign or sublet your space, in case you need to move your business or unexpectedly close it, then you want to make sure the process is not unnecessarily onerous. Every lease requires the landlord&#8217;s consent to sublease unless you are renting desk space to another firm and this is permitted in the lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lease concessions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is common for leases to include a rent-free period and a tenant improvement allowance (TIA) for use during the contractor build-out of the interior, particularly if the landlord is providing a raw space. Alternatively, the landlord might choose to renovate on behalf of a tenant, subject to their requirements; rent typically commences when the tenant assumes occupancy of the finished space. During times when the market favors tenants, landlords are often willing to provide funding for the build-out. The dollar amount is usually calculated based on the rentable square footage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the time, landlords are more willing to grant concessions when it is a long-term lease, because they are guaranteed income for a longer length of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with base rents, the market generally dictates lease concessions. But depending on the condition of the space and a tenant’s requirements and credit, these concessions can differ significantly on properties that have similar base rents. It’s important that your real estate broker understands your preferences so that many of these issues can be discussed upfront at or prior to the term-sheet stage and finalized by your attorney in the lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Renewal options</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are no automatic lease renewals in commercial real estate. Once your lease expires, there are also no caps on what the landlord can ask for the new rent. Of course, market conditions will influence how strong a position you are in to negotiate. One way to pre-empt this issue is to negotiate for an “option to renew” in your initial lease. Discuss and decide whether this will be a fixed increase or a “fair-market” rent increase, which is calculated by looking at comparable properties and transactions in the neighborhood and may be subject to arbitration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Permitted use</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make sure that your intended use of the property is permitted by the Certificate of Occupancy (issued by the Department of Buildings) as well as by zoning regulations. The lease needs to state clearly what the permitted uses are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security deposit and guarantees</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Landlords want a reliable tenant. They attempt to ensure this in a number of ways, including via security deposits and guarantees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are deemed somewhat risky, this will be reflected in the amount of security deposit the landlord will require upfront. Security deposits in many cases must be in the form of a letter of credit from your bank, and typically the first month’s rent is due at lease execution, even if there is a free rent period at the beginning of the lease. A corporate guarantee from a parent company that owns the corporate entity signing the lease and/or a “good guy” guaranty provided by a principal of the firm may also be required.</p>

			<h2>Know the process and costs for replacing electrical wiring at home to keep your renovation surprise-free</h2>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">New homeowners and prospective buyers in NYC often learn that electrical upgrades might be needed for a decade- or century-old apartment or townhouse. “Electrical work,” though, is a vague term that ranges from installing a light fixture to replacing a building’s internal wiring. So you&#8217;re wondering: what does it </span><span class="s2">cost to replace electrical wiring</span><span class="s3"> in a home? </span><span class="s1">Sweeten offers some tips and expert advice about electrical work and potential costs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Because electrical magic happens behind walls, forecasting the scope of additions and </span><span class="s2">costs to update electrical wiring </span><span class="s1">can be challenging. Those cost estimates are also crucial if you’re budgeting for a renovation or for a new home purchase.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">How do I know what kind of electrical work a place needs?</span></h3>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Analyzing the existing electrical</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Contractors will first examine the electrical panel (or “box”) to determine circuit load capacity. In other words, what more can the existing wiring handle? Experienced contractors can generally tell by looking at the circuits what can and cannot be done. That is, do you need to add more capacity to the existing system? Or, upgrade to a larger panel because slots for breakers are full?</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Electrical needs for older homes</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Pre-war apartments that haven’t been updated in decades often need significant electrical re-wiring and additional wattage to support modern electrical demands. Many NYC buildings constructed through the early part of the twentieth century were multi-layered with older wiring systems. Some have ungrounded systems that lack code-approved grounding conductors. Others have metallic insulation materials like aluminum or copper wiring that may actually increase the chances of electrical shock or fire. These older wiring systems, typically with 60 to 100 amps of service, violate <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/downloads/bldgs_code/electrical_code_local_law_39of2011.pdf"><span class="s4">current electrical codes</span></a>. They also fall short of the standard minimum of 200 amps generally needed to power a home.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">According to N.Y.-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor Frank</a>, “I’ve done a lot of new services, and I recommend having new electrical. When you spend X amount of dollars on the apartment renovation, you need everything to be working.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ultimately, the electrical code determines what’s required, and it’s highly detailed. Each room must have a light fixture, for example, and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors must be hardwired. (This is because battery-powered models are not allowed.) This evaluation of your system is part of your walk-through with your general contractor.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">What if I just want to install new appliances?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Installing air conditioners, appliances, or entertainment systems may seem simple. However, these can quickly overwhelm an older building’s capacity. Your home’s electrical load capacity is like a surge protector on a much larger scale. If you have too many wires plugged into an outlet, the circuit may overload. That leads to tripped breakers and blown fuses that shut down all power. So, if your electrical system is not capable of handling the additional load, a relatively straightforward appliance installation could become a much more invasive and substantial project. Installing a new electrical circuit panel or a complete overhaul of the electrical wiring may be possible.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One clear example is air conditioning. “For homes without central AC,” general contractor Frank noted, “you have to run a dedicated line in every room for an AC unit. It could be either a wall unit or a window unit, but each room has to have a dedicated outlet for the AC unit.” Kitchens and bathrooms are not included in this requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Each circuit is wired from that AC unit to the panel with no other devices drawing power from it. That can add up to a substantial amount of new wiring to meet code, and it’s not optional. The entire system must be brought up to code, whether or not you install an AC unit. As for cost for this project, it’s highly variable and, as always, depends partly on the panel having capacity for new circuits. A dedicated line, Frank said, “would run between <strong>$300</strong> and <strong>$1,000</strong>.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">How does rewiring work? </span></h3>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">The electrical rewiring process</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If your place is in for a full electrical upgrade, you need to plan and budget for a labor-intensive and disruptive process. Your electrician will temporarily shut off power and your contractor will open up the walls. Since wires are attached to framing within the walls, rewiring can be very invasive. Your team might completely demolish entire walls to access all the old wires and replace them. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One type of surprise for homeowners, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/7085" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor Mohsen</a>, who is based in New York, is framing changes. Bringing older homes and apartments up to modern standards may require adjusting the existing framing to accommodate new equipment.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s5">“</span><span class="s6">What is behind the ceiling? Do we have enough space for recessed lights?” he said. “Do we have enough space for the fan? Choosing a fan that doesn’t fit the space may require reframing. Sometimes dropping the entire bathroom ceiling for the fan can also be a surprise,” Mohsen added.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">How much will </span><span class="s2">electrical wiring cost</span><span class="s1">?</span></h3>
<h4 class="p6"><span class="s6">Budgeting for an electrical overhaul</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To finish, the walls are plastered and painted. The electrician connects the remaining switches and outlets, closes up the new electrical panel, and installs light fixtures. The full </span><span class="s2">electrical wiring cost</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s1">of this kind of project, with demolition, permits, labor, materials, construction, and painting can cost from<b> $15,000 and up</b> depending on the size of your space and extent of work. If you are gut-renovating an entire home, a full electrical overhaul might represent somewhere around <strong>5%</strong> <strong>of your total budget</strong>. If your renovation is limited to a particular room (like a kitchen), a full electrical overhaul may end up matching or exceeding the total cost of the project you&#8217;re planning. The </span><span class="s2">costs to update electrical wiring in a home</span><span class="s3"> involve more than just electrical work.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Rewiring aside, what else might I need for electrical work?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Contractors assess electrical needs and costs for clients based on a series of questions:</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">1. What is already in place vs. what you are trying to accomplish?</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Identify what kind of light fixtures or electrical systems are in place and what’s not there. If you want to install lighting, put in a security system, or run a phone line in a particular location that doesn’t have existing wiring, contractors have to perform an electrical “rough-in.”  That is the preliminary step to lay out the basic wiring to proper specifications before connections and insulation are completed</span><span class="s7">. The rough-in cost is generally calculated by the length of the wiring lines installed (linear feet running from the circuit box to the point where outlets and switches are mounted), the cost of materials, and the labor rate. Rough-ins might also be charged at a flat rate of <b>$250–$400 </b>per junction box, outlet, or switch. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">2. What type of light fixtures and finishes do you want and how many do you need?</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Contractors charge labor costs that include running cables to devices and connecting wiring to circuit boxes based on the number and type of fixtures you want to install. Generally, swapping an old light fixture for a new one comes in at around <b>$100 </b>per fixture or at an hourly fee. Installing new fixtures like pendants and recessed LED lights comes in at around <b>$200–$400</b> per fixture and larger, heavier fixtures like chandeliers cost in the range of <b>$500–$800</b> per fixture.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">3. How much amp service does your electrical panel hold?</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Electrical panels in NYC usually hold 200 amps of service, so if your electrical service is short of that, the system won’t have enough power or space in the circuit box to accommodate new demands. In this case, you need to upgrade your electrical panel, which can cost <b>$2,000</b> to <b>$5,000 and up</b> for a new box<i>.</i> If you have an existing electrical panel with enough room for new circuits but you’re planning a renovation that might add some heavy-duty appliances, you may want to consider adding a new circuit breaker, which typically costs <b>$300</b> to <b>$800</b> per breaker in order to accommodate a higher electrical capacity load. Adding a new circuit to the panel allows you to install more outlets, which generally cost around <b>$100</b> to <b>$300</b> per outlet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Frank noted that older homes with outdated service may present an unwelcome surprise if the service to the house is inadequate. He recently completed a project that required new 200-amp service from the street, as the existing service was only 80 amps. That new service required the electric company to run a new buried line to the house, and also required trenching in the yard and a new poured concrete sidewalk. All that work cost the homeowners <strong>$5,000</strong> before Frank could even get to work inside the home.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Permits and processes for electrical work</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For anything other than a fixture swap or a straightforward appliance installation, you will need an electrician licensed by the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/index.page"><span class="s4">Department of Buildings</span></a> who must first file an electrical application and pay permit fees in order to conduct electrical work. Once a permit is obtained, an inspection must take place, and a certificate is mailed to ensure that the work was properly completed and inspected.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s8">cost to replace electrical wiring</span><span class="s1"> is hugely variable. Balancing current wiring with future needs while meeting code is complex and requires a competent professional electrician.</span></p>

<p>Any home remodel in New York City that involves adjusting partitions or plumbing requires a work permit from the Department of Buildings (DOB).  Although the rules aren&#8217;t always observed, upstanding architects and contractors spend a great deal of time chasing these permits.</p>
<p>I worked with a couple who are remodeling their bathrooms and I&#8217;m shocked at how convoluted the DOB procedure is, even with a professional expediter to help us.  The application required specially formatted construction drawings and two sets of paperwork.  In addition to the architect&#8217;s fee and the expediter&#8217;s fee the owners paid a fee for the DOB filing and another for the work permit.  The most exasperating part was the time frame.  After rushing to submit an application we waited four weeks to hear back from the DOB, who had minor objections, and then another two weeks to hear back after submitting revisions.</p>
<p>The whole effort to get the permit, which took almost two months, felt less like a procedure to protect life and safety than a Medieval ritual to collect wealth for the king.  For small residential remodels like this one, there&#8217;s got to be a simpler, faster way for the city to regulate the work.</p>
