										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Inspiring makeovers of the most popular room in the home</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful kitchen renovation isn’t measured by the number of walls knocked down or the size of a kitchen island. Instead, it&#8217;s the thoughtful details and design elements culled over time from Pinterest and the hours of research on materials coming to life that brings the joy for a lifestyle that finally fits you and your family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we look at 11 kitchens renovated by homeowners who came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, </span><span class="s1">a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some were major transformations removing walls, creating built-ins, and adding new windows, while others proved that smart improvements in space efficiency, updated materials, and renewed layouts gave them the overall refreshes they wanted. </span></p>
<h3>From outdated to classic gray</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After living on Long Island for many years, Rosalind and Lawrence were ready to downsize and return to their beloved former hometown of Brooklyn. They purchased a 100-year-old home in Cypress Hills and slowly started renovating the outdated spaces. After refreshes of two bathrooms, a staircase, and a walk-in closet were complete, they decided to turn their attention to the kitchen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main problem besides the yellow walls, dated wooden cabinets, and orange-tiled backsplash, was the lack of storage. Rosalind was forced to store her larger appliances like the slow cooker and mixer in the living room. So, with the help of a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor, the couple <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchen-tv-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reimagined their layout</a> and added a kitchen island that doubles as storage as well as a convenient gathering spot. Rosalind chose gray tones throughout and accented them with interesting geometric shapes.</span></p>

<h3>Same layout, more storage</h3>

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoko and Rob really liked their 900-square-foot apartment in Harlem, New York. The only thing that gnawed at them was the “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">orange-y cabinetry, shiny black appliances, and brown countertop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” So they decided to take the plunge and redo the small kitchen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They did their research and found information from designer </span><a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keren Richter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on how to make the most of their cook space and turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to execute their vision. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to overhauling the look of the kitchen, they wanted to improve the flow and functionality with more storage as their top goal. Their original kitchen didn’t take advantage of the ceiling height so they extended the new upper cabinetry to get as close as possible to the ceiling. In all, they were able to create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sunny-kitchen-harlem-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimalist style yet warm space</a> to cook in and entertain.</span></p>

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you make a house feel more like a loft apartment? First, you open up the layout so that you have an unobstructed sightline across the first floor. For Romuald and his family, this meant tearing down a wall between the kitchen and the main living space. To regain the storage space lost by removing the cabinets on that wall, they decided to do what many do: build an island. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-apartment-inside-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added other design touches</a> to fit into their cooking-centric lives. Their </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contractor suggested they install an “appliance garage” to make their countertop less cluttered. Being avid cooks, Romuald and his wife have a lot of small appliances, including a toaster, coffee maker, and mixer, that would be nicely concealed—but yet easily accessible—by this storage solution. They also put in a pot-filler above the stove and a microwave drawer in the island. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The warm gray cabinets complement the white quartz countertop and the classic subway tile of the backsplash. For ease of cleaning and added durability, Romuald installed a porcelain floor that mimics the look of real wood.</span></p>

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veteran renovators Jennifer and Joe always knew their New Jersey apartment wouldn’t be complete without a kitchen remodel. They, like many homeowners, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/edgewater-new-jersey-kitchen-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wanted an open-concept layout</a> in order to see the amazing views of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Manhattan skyline, Statue of Liberty, and George Washington Bridge that their apartment affords. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They asked their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor to knock down a wall to get better sightlines to the wall of windows in their living room. Unfortunately, the entire wall could not be removed as it was load-bearing. So their contractor took down as much of the wall as possible and utilized the rest of the space to house the refrigerator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer and Joe based the design entirely around the marble waterfall island, which features a deep black base with white veins throughout the countertop. The color palette of the entire kitchen plays off the two tones, with glossy black drawers and all-white upper and lower cabinetry as well as a white quartz countertop. Not one detail was spared, from the under-cabinet lighting to the textured backsplash.</span></p>

<h3>Midcentury Scandi meets Italian modern</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/mid-century-scandinavian-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">midcentury Scandi meets 70s Italian modern</a>,” says Brooklyn Sweeten homeowner Melissa of her design preference for her kitchen. The co-op building itself had a midcentury vibe so she wanted to continue it inside. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first, her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor removed walls that were blocking off the kitchen from the living area. Once that was complete, natural sunlight bathed the entire apartment. She carefully selected a mix of different materials (matte concrete floor and counters) as well as warmer accents in her textile and paint choices. A built-in shelf intersects over a new peninsula for additional seating. She didn’t <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/plumbing-changes-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">move the plumbing</a> (which is an added cost) or change the location of the appliances. </span></p>

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For their one-bedroom co-op in a 19th-century converted warehouse, homeowners Dan and Mike wanted to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bring their 1980s kitchen into a new era</a>. While they desired a nod to the industrial roots of the building, they did want the aesthetic to be balanced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They hired a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor to help redefine the space. To create an open floor plan, a wall was removed as well as the upper cabinets, which were replaced with beautiful open shelves of salvaged Douglas Fir. The base cabinets were updated from laminate to a full set of IKEA cabinets and drawers, <a href="https://sweeten.com/tag/semihandmade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customized by Semihandmade</a>. A modern waterfall countertop on the peninsula was used to visually </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate the kitchen entry.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They also utilized </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">different natural and synthetic wood finishes to maintain a measure of warmth and masculinity.</span></p>

<h3>A dark kitchen sees the (natural) light </h3>

<a href='https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/before-after-kitchen-edition/attachment/sweeten-nydia-after/'><img decoding="async" width="600" height="400" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After-600x400.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large" alt="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a>
<a href='https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/before-after-kitchen-edition/attachment/nydia-before/'><img decoding="async" width="600" height="400" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nydia-Before-600x400.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large" alt="dark brown kitchen cabinets and white countertop before renovation" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nydia-Before-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nydia-Before-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nydia-Before.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a>

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after tackling other updates to their colonial-style home, Nydia and Jonathan knew that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/modern-colonial-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovating their Brooklyn kitchen</a> was a top priority. The old version had mismatched appliances, dated cabinets, and not enough counter space. The dark space hardly felt welcoming (or functional) for their family of five. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to help with the construction process, hiring a trusted contractor from its carefully vetted network. The project involved rethinking the layout to opening up the stairway to the basement, which is accessed via the kitchen. The renovation helped key kitchen elements find new locations: the refrigerator moved out of the main cooking area, the dishwasher now sits directly across from the sink, and the walls surrounding the basement stairs were taken down. By replacing existing cabinets with ceiling-height ones and adding a peninsula, the space was really transformed.</span></p>

<h3>From functional to fabulous</h3>

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mutual love of cooking (and of cooking together) ultimately led Marissa and Jeremy to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-kitchen-fit-for-the-lights-on-broadway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovate their small kitchen</a> in their Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, co-op. The space was so cramped that it brought about a special house rule: Only one person allowed in the kitchen at a time when cooking in order to keep the peace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty-four inches of usable counter space was quintupled through the renovation, while other unique elements were added to suit the couple’s preferences and lifestyle. For example, they went non-traditional for the backsplash, using an antique mirror. They also installed a ventless </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">washer/dryer combo unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and removed the space-invading </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gas dryer vent. “While a gas dryer dries clothes much faster than a ventless dryer, I wanted the extra counter space more than I wanted clothes dried in 20 minutes,” Marissa said. They capped off the gas vent and went long with the back counter. “I am excited about so many parts of our kitchen that I don’t know if I can pick a favorite!” she said.</span></p>

<h3>A modern vision brought to life through an extension</h3>

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Laura and Tim, they decided they needed to do something about their kitchen that was “falling apart”—it had water damage from a leaky shower upstairs, the door to the patio was drafty, the cabinets were dark and “grungy,” and it generally just needed some fixing up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple consulted their friend and designer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzy Leon of </span><a href="https://www.suzyleondesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzy Leon Design, Ltd.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and came up with a plan to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-patio-house-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gut the existing kitchen but also enclose their back patio</a>. The additional interior square footage would connect and provide a better flow between the kitchen, dining room, and outdoor space. The new enclosure would feature skylights to brighten the space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They kept the galley layout but chose a light color palette in the “minty” green shaker cabinets to offset the dark plank wood floors. White quartz countertops were utilized to help make the flow look more open and airy.</span></p>

<h3>Reaching new heights—with less ceiling</h3>

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an 18-inch tiny dishwasher, an oven that wasn’t big enough to fit a cookie tray, and a kitchen sitting underneath a loft, a renovation was long overdue for this mom who cooked five nights a week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One major challenge homeowners Emily and Trey faced was the inability to move the building&#8217;s intercom system that was smack in the middle of the kitchen. They hired a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor who came up with a good solution: create an L-shaped peninsula to accommodate the immovable pole—and give them more space and storage at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the new peninsula, they were also able to get rid of the loft above, which increased the ceiling height drastically. The result was <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-remodel-breaks-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a well-thought-out new kitchen</a> perfect for the family of four&#8217;s busy lifestyle.</span></p>

<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer and Jonn couldn’t believe their luck when they found their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom duplex in Manhattan&#8217;s Upper East Side. It was the perfect location for their family of two kids and a dog. The story goes that the co-op was the result of combining three one-bedroom apartments to create a huge two-level residence with sole access to a sprawling rear garden. Voila! The perfect home&#8230;but with one catch: It needed to be renovated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple had their work cut out for them with this space that hadn&#8217;t been updated since the &#8217;70s. They hired a contractor through <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> who was able to transform their <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/duplex-remodel-first-time-renovators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white laminate kitchen into a light-filled galley kitchen</a> with an eat-in banquette. They used shaker cabinets and five-panel doors while incorporating metals like brass lights and stainless steel appliances for a modern look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kitchens are arguably one of the most pivotal spaces in our homes. From giving us a gathering point to break bread together to providing space to tackle assignments and hobbies; every kitchen should deliver the kind of peace of mind (and organizational flow) that homeowners need. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating a home can be a stressful process when you do it on your own—but it can be doubly so with someone you love. When there’s cohabitating involved, balancing different styles, opinions, and taste levels can get dicey. From choosing materials and appliances to deciding what makes the punch list, determining how to merge your style with a significant other is key to making a happy home. Here, couples give us a peek into renovating together, from blending opposite styles and accommodating one partner’s “bull-in-a-china-shop” cooking habits to one project ending in an engagement!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hissan-sophias-kitchen-foyer-renovation-downtown-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hissan and Sophia</a> knew that they wanted to purchase a larger home but couldn’t see eye-to-eye on style when it came time to renovate. Instead of choosing one’s vision over the other, the couple agreed to compromise. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom molding and classic, patterned wallpaper satisfied Sophia’s taste for the traditional. And by incorporating Hissan’s preference for the industrial—reclaimed dark wooden beams and oversized matte-finish pendants—this kitchen was able to find its style sweet spot.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21721" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x896.jpg" alt="White kitchen" width="600" height="896" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x896.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lia and Chris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developed a strong point of view going into their renovation that made selecting materials, appliances, and fixtures a smooth process. However, although they share similar styles, the couple debated over a waterfall edge for the kitchen countertop and labored over the decision of whether the kitchen should remain galley-style. Their commitment to working together, especially when making tough decisions, allowed them to create a kitchen they love.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21720 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-723x482.jpg" alt="White and blue kitchen" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikki and Chris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, living through a kitchen and bathroom renovation brought the couple even closer. In combining their styles, Chris took the initiative to find vintage-inspired hardware to match their wish of a modernized, NYC prewar bathroom. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their renovation had teaching moments including trusting others to work in their home and to take care of it, discovering their own preferences, managing a budget and timeline, and learning how to compromise. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also grew closer to their community during construction as they showered at friends’ homes and brushed their teeth at local coffee shops. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/becky-kitchen-renovation-clinton-hill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becky and Sarah</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spent most of the summer hiding out in their bedroom while their kitchen renovation was underway. Although living through the renovation was stressful at times, the couple didn’t just survive the process—they thrived. Their beautiful new kitchen led to an engagement. Sarah said that the renovation could have torn them apart, but in the end, it only made their bond stronger.</span></p>

Together, they chose materials that would suit their needs, deciding on built-to-order cabinets to expand storage and a durable and stain-resistant counter to account for Jared’s “bull-in-china-shop” tendencies. The result? A kitchen that can truly stand their combined heat.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week&#8217;s Before and After brings a little Christmas-in-July cheer for a family of three in Brooklyn&#8217;s Columbia Waterfront District. Robyn, Alejandro, and their daughter Bianca stopped by a cavernous, dark two-bedroom condo on Christmas Eve, hoping the new year might bring a new home for their family. What they found was an apartment in total disrepair &#8211; more than a little TLC would be required to update the space, but the square footage and bustling location seemed promising. Robyn and Alejandro prepared for everything short of moving walls and came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> with a long list of updates needed in every room. The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photos on their project post</a>, all taken while the place was still on the market, make it hard to imagine what a renovation could do, but Robyn saw potential for a more open, chef&#8217;s industrial kitchen. To make it all happen in time for summer, we matched Robyn&#8217;s vision with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a> &#8211; a veteran design and custom cabinetry duo and the team behind <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/claire-mikes-park-slope-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claire and Mike&#8217;s beautiful Park Slope kitchen</a>, which Robyn threw in as inspiration in her planning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-with-gray-cabinets-and-chalkboard" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47830 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Bathroom.jpg" alt="small kitchen with gray cabinets and stainless steel appliances and large chalkboard on wall and pendant light and built-in book shelves in the hallway after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Bathroom.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Bathroom-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Bathroom-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span id="more-13517"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original kitchen felt almost like a kitchenette: the most functional fixtures and appliances were jammed up against the back wall with just a foot or so of counter space to spare on one side, and the kitchen was hemmed in by an old fridge and a partial wall. Even in a space twice its size, the conditions of the cabinets, flooring, and countertops were total deal breakers. Clearly, all of it had to go. Robyn brought a strong guiding sense of function to the project and decided early on that the new kitchen would be oriented around a few major appliances: a <a href="https://www.vikingrange.com/consumer/category/products/cooking;jsessionid=ZnTEB-gEGHU0WPVtbC6XIA**.node2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking range</a> and a farmhouse sink topped the list of dream pieces. Robyn and Alejandro hit their stride with Paulina as they thought through ways to bring in more light and make the most of the kitchen&#8217;s layout, and they drew up plans to focus workspace around the range, split food prep and clean up tasks on opposite sides, and replace peeling laminate counters and cabinets with quality finishes that reflected the family&#8217;s focus on cooking and eating together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="two-kitchen-images-before-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47834 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Kitchen-Before-1-1.jpg" alt="two images of kitchen with oak cabinets and old appliances with tiles on wall before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Kitchen-Before-1-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Kitchen-Before-1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Kitchen-Before-1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="two-kitchen-images-during-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47833 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Kitchen-During.jpg" alt="two images of demolished kitchen and work-in progress during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Kitchen-During.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Kitchen-During-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Robyn_Alejandro-Kitchen-During-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paulina and Albert&#8217;s team got down to business, ripping out everything in sight and removing the kitchen&#8217;s entry wall dividers. From top to bottom, here is Robyn&#8217;s rundown of the fixtures and finishes that now fill this family&#8217;s beautiful kitchen!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Floors</strong> &#8211; Robyn opted to forego tiling and extend the living room&#8217;s re-surfaced and re-stained oak floors into the kitchen. Paulina and Albert were able to match a new section of wood seamlessly using a light stain with a hint of gray to neutralize the space and complement the cool color palette that Robyn was assembling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cabinets</strong> &#8211; Paulina helped Robyn stay away from a white kitchen with painted gray, Shaker-style cabinets. Paulina&#8217;s design added paneling along the outer edges to elegantly frame the room, and Albert created slim toe-kick drawers for an additional layer of storage. Paulina stowed a generous row of outlets along the cabinets&#8217; underside with a strip of LED lighting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Countertop</strong> &#8211; The couple selected a granite stone cut with gray undertones and luminous purple specks that brings the durability of granite with a look that more closely approximates marble veining.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Backsplash</strong> &#8211; Robyn found a stainless steel tile that nods to the neighborhood&#8217;s industrial shipping past and present. Paulina extended the tiles beyond the point of a traditional backsplash, lining the kitchen&#8217;s central wall and framing the kid-friendly (and spouse-friendly!) chalkboard wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen&#8217;s starring features, that sparkling Viking range and <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/browse/kitchen-kitchen-sinks/_/N-25b4Z1z13vf8?id1=www.kohler.com/apronfront/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler apron front sink</a>, take center stage on each side of the kitchen, with ample work and storage space flanking both. The family added a <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/cooling/refrigeration/all-refrigeration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel fridge</a> and a narrow width <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/products/dishwashers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch dishwasher</a> &#8211; two high-impact but trim footprint pieces used every day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Robyn and Alejandro&#8217;s kitchen was just the start of this condo&#8217;s full renovation. We&#8217;ll check back with this sweet family for a full tour of the rest of their home before the summer is up!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Barrin in Carroll Gardens spent 18 years in his three bed / two bath condo before deciding that quick fixes and appliance swaps in the kitchen were no longer cutting it. The kitchen had one giant plus: great space anchored by a gorgeous original cedar beam. The minuses? Formica counters and peeling particle board cabinetry struggling mightily to make it to a third decade. After a microwave grease fire during his first years in the condo, a few appliance replacements here and there, and some cosmetic work on the floors, Barrin was ready for the apartment&#8217;s first real kitchen renovation. He <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted his project</a> on Sweeten and we brought <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Evros</a> in to revive this kitchen and bring back its simpler industrial roots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-and-after/before-after-barrins-carroll-gardens-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13344 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-00-cover-b.png" alt="SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-00-cover-b" width="600" height="406" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-00-cover-b.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-00-cover-b-300x203.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span id="more-13249"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like many other buildings in Carroll Gardens and neighboring Red Hook, the condos had been converted from a former factory with lots of loft-space and exposed wood awesomeness. Barrin and Evros went bottom to top to create more storage and keep the architectural details at center stage. The kitchen floor had black granite tiles installed by a previous owner with renters, and the cabinets leftover from the factory&#8217;s conversion were builder-grade. The drawers didn&#8217;t have any of the full extension glide that more modern construction routinely offers, which limited accessible drawer space by 30%. And while so many NYC kitchens are relegated to just one or two walls (or a galley at best), this room&#8217;s full size needed more thoughtful corner cabinetry and some help re-thinking an outdated partition by the entry.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13252" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/large-1.jpg" alt="large-1" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/large-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/large-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Barrin looked to the ceiling for inspiration with the floors, choosing sturdy porcelain tiles in a light, woodgrain finish to align with the flow of the exposed wood planks. The cabinets presented multiple challenges: Barrin originally eyed IKEA for cost-saving cabinets, but the kitchen&#8217;s ducts and corners made it difficult to go with standard sizes. Barrin chose a white Shaker semi-custom option, ordering cabinet bases from a dealer and creating custom doors and alterations. Barrin found the neutral granite countertops at a local stone yard in Brooklyn &#8212; as the plans came together, he considered a black or charcoal gray stone for contrast, but ended up deciding that the natural brown and ivory tones in the granite would better complement the kitchen&#8217;s wood features.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Evros&#8217;s team removed the partition that sectioned off the kitchen&#8217;s entry and extended the double-height countertop to wrap around and accommodate counter-height food prep and bar-height meals. Expanded storage under the counter allowed Evros to tailor one section for Barrin&#8217;s cookbooks and build out corner storage for bulkier appliances like roasting pans and a food processor. Look closely for a Sweeten blog first: most of the electrical outlets are hidden under cabinets, but the handful that do interrupt the backsplash are dual electrical outlets and USB ports. Electrical outlets + USB ports = yes! I feel silly for not realizing this was a thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Evros also relocated the sink from a central point and moved it to the right to open up more prep area near the stove. Barrin chose a glass tile backsplash, alternating clear glass with a painted base and buffed glass in the same green hue &#8211; a smart way to bring texture and a little bit of gloss in without adding more color. A slim, <a href="https://www.geappliances.com/products/profile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 inch GE fridge</a>, a <a href="https://www.miele.com/en/com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miele dishwasher</a> with three internal drawers, <a href="https://www.hansgrohe-usa.com/18865.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hansgrohe faucet fixtures</a>, and <a href="https://www.kohlercompany.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler sink</a> round out the best of the new appliances. Barrin loves the combination of under-cabinet lighting, sleeker LED track lighting, and blue glass pendants from Manhattan Lights &#8211; all dimmable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you, Barrin, for this tour! Bravo to you and your expert team for this beautiful transformation!</p>
