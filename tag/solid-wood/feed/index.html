										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">The lowdown on wood flooring options—solid, engineered, reclaimed—and how to choose</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20504 size-chrono" title="hardwood flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg" alt="sweeten_rima_hardwood_flooring-10" width="723" height="482" /></a>(Above) Rima installed mid-sized <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/rimas-ikea-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plank engineered wood</a> with a matte finish throughout her home.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Of all the surface options available for the home, hardwood flooring remains the one with the most cachet and value. After all, it&#8217;s warm in appearance, easy underfoot (especially compared to tile or stone), versatile in application thanks to the range of wood species and finishes available, and innately luxurious. From solid to engineered to salvaged, you’re likely to find an option that suits your home’s style as well as your lifestyle.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Wood flooring prices can vary greatly, depending on where the flooring was manufactured, how it was made, how it was finished, and who’s installing it. Base your decision on where the floor will go, and what type of activity those rooms will see. Flooring is an investment—of resources and the time it takes to install it. Make the right choice, and you will enjoy your wood floor for probably as long as you want it.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Consider your lifestyle</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">First, examine what the room or room(s) will be used for, how much traffic they will experience, and what kind. Wood can be enjoyed throughout most homes, with a few precautions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Will there be pets scratching it with their nails? </span><span class="s1">High heels from frequent entertaining? </span><span class="s1">Toys from energetic little ones?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Do you expect grit consistently tracked from the front door or backyard? </span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does the room get loads of sunlight that could fade the surface in some areas? </span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Is there the possibility of accidental yet prolonged exposure to water, next to a dishwasher or by a bathtub, which could cause the floor to swell? </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Today’s hardwood flooring often features highly durable polyurethane coatings that are formulated to stand up to light or average wear, but you will need to commit yourself to a regular maintenance routine in order to keep the surface beautiful. And engineered versions, with a wood veneer backed by a composite that helps assure its stability (while slightly lowering the cost compared to its solid wood cousin), can sometimes go in environments that experience some moisture, like a basement or a bathroom.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27034 size-chrono" title="engineered wood flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="hardwood flooring" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) Throughout Tom and Alex&#8217;s apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/mid-century-mad-men-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engineered wood</a> replaced old parquet floors.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Customize the look</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Each species of wood has its own color and grain, and the choice is yours. Appearance has expanded beyond classic wood species and stains to include colored washes and dramatic textures added during manufacturing, from classic satin to wire-brushed to scraped. These distressed effects also serve to hide some wear over time as well as enhance character. Dimensions vary, too, from traditional narrow strips to wide planks that lend a rustic mood and also means fewer seams into the overall floor.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The hardness of the wood should be taken into account, too. If your floor will see a lot of action, you want one of the harder species, like oak, maple, or hickory. The ranking system for hardness among different species, called the Janka hardness test, measures how a wood stands up to dents and wear. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Finishes affect the overall style, with a range of high, medium, or low gloss available from most manufacturers, depending on whether you want a highly polished or a more satiny effect. The finish, applied in anywhere from three to seven coats, should include aluminum oxide to make it resistant to the abrasions of daily foot traffic. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Click-lock versus tongue-and-groove</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Edge treatments vary widely to give you plenty of options to achieve the look you want, from square to beveled to scraped to pillowed. Wood floors connect one edge to another by means of two methods: </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Like the term implies, click-lock boards click into place to provide an almost seamless appearance, except for the grain of the wood. Found in engineered wood flooring, these require no adhesive and so the installation tends to go faster.</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The tongue-and-groove method fits together using a thin piece on one long side that fits into the grooved indenture on the adjoining board’s side. Planks are further secured when nailed, glued, or laid in a floating installation. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28816" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02-1-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />(Above) Dark walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardwood flooring</a> in Jonathan and Cecilia&#8217;s home adds richness and a sense of depth to their space.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Get real with solid hardwood</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solid hardwood</a> comes either factory-finished or can be finished on site. Factory-finished flooring arrives needing only to be installed, making it clean and quick to lay down. This method eliminates or reduces the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The curing that site-finished wood requires (which can take up to two months as the wood adjusts to your home’s climate)</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Dust from sanding</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Chemical fumes from the finish</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Length of time from start of installation to complete drying of finish</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Length of time to final use of room</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The finish is also cured under UV lights at the factory, a process that can’t happen on site, so the factory-finish is likely tougher than the one applied on site. This floor should also include a warranty from the manufacturer instead of the installer. The main benefit of having a site-finished floor is if you desire total control over the final look. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Factory-finished floors typically arrive already topped with several layers of a water- or oil-based polyurethane coating that incorporates aluminum oxide to protect the wood from scratches and fading due to sunlight. A clear top coat provides the glossy or satin appearance. This floor can be refinished several times until the multilayer coating is completely removed, which then means reapplying the finish or, in extreme situations, replacing the plank. If your floor is finished on site, discuss with the installer what type of finish he recommends, and if it includes aluminum oxide.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Caution: Solid wood is a natural material, making it vulnerable to swings in temperature and humidity. Because it will expand and contract, it must be fastened to a subfloor but not concrete, so it can’t go below-grade or in damp areas like a basement or a bath that gets lots of steam.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28813 size-chrono" title="engineered wood floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="hardwood flooring" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engineered wood</a> finished with a natural veneer pairs well with exposed brick in Miguel&#8217;s bedroom.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Fool the eye with engineered wood</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If it looks like it’s real wood, that’s because it is—a veneer of real wood atop a structural base, typically plywood. The base gives it added stability so it can go in a bath or a basement, as well as over radiant heating elements. It requires fewer trees than solid hardwood, but the base includes glues that bind the plywood and the veneer. This option is easy to install as a floating floor or it can be secured with staples or glue. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Expect to find all the classic species of woods and stains in this engineered wood category, as well as some fun fashion colors like a gray wash. You’ll discover a range of quality, too, so when shopping, investigate the thickness of the veneer, the number of protective coatings, and the number of ply in the base, which can range from three to seven and up. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Refinishing engineered wood is far more limited than solid wood—as little as once, depending on the thickness of the veneer. Buy an extra box in the event you need to replace a plank, so you don’t have to worry about matching. Ask about warranties for both the finish and veneer delamination.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Go authentic with reclaimed wood</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Probably the most environmentally-friendly choice, reclaimed wood that is salvaged from old buildings requires no cutting of trees. Its unique appeal comes from its original sourcing, which may be domestic woods that are now rare or unavailable for residential use. Like a vintage wine, reclaimed wood also shows a character that can’t be reproduced today, even from advanced manufacturing techniques. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This wood is typically sourced from old factories, deconstructed homes, old decking or piers, but it still has to be treated to go into its new home. It may be warped or cracked in areas, and so require some milling before it’s ready for installation. Make sure the wood is kiln-dried after milling, as this will aid its stability and also eliminate the possibility of critters, such as termites. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This category can be found from a few national dealers, like Mountain Lumber, or locally by doing a search online, but if you shop from an independent dealer, make sure he or she guarantees the product.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Consider maintenance and repair </b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The biggest enemy of your wood floor is nearly invisible grit tracked in on shoes. Place area rugs or mats at entry points to catch dirt. Try to sweep or vacuum daily, clean monthly with a wood floor cleaner recommended by the manufacturer, so you can enjoy your floor for a lifetime.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Good news: You can have pretty much whatever you want, as long as you follow a few guidelines</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22170 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="Maple engineered wood flooring in IKEA kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label">Engineered wood flooring in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/rimas-ikea-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rima&#8217;s</a> kitchen</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The decisions to be made when designing a kitchen can be daunting—the sheer number alone, let alone the anxiety. Will this material work in the cook space? Will it hold up? Will I still like it in five years? Factor in a growing family and those worries begin to multiply: What if the kids drop their juice boxes; will it stain? What if my child falls&#8230;will he hurt himself?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides looks and function, you need to consider what type of traffic the flooring will experience. Is it off the garage or a deck, where dirt can be tracked in? Do you also have pets that can scratch with claws or bring water and dirt from outside? Is your child in a high chair that gets dragged around frequently in one area, or has he graduated to his own mini vehicle during playtime, adding to the wear and tear? Health is a factor, too, of course, and any flooring that is manufactured and/or has a finish should be able to provide a rating for its various contents and performance, including VOC emission and slippage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take all of these factors into account as you consider the following materials underfoot. The good news: You can install just about whatever you want, and, with a few precautions, continue to enjoy it as your family grows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hardwood</strong><br />
Sought out for its natural elegance, wood also delivers a lot: It offers a slight pliancy underfoot so items you drop are less likely to break than on a harder surface such as tile. The two basic wood options:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Solid wood</strong></span><br />
If you love solid wood, opt for prefinished floors (aka, “factory finished”) that come from the factory with a hard-wearing top coat of aluminum oxide urethane that offers protection from scratches while minimizing upkeep, like waxing; daily sweeping should do it. Ask your dealer about the warranty, which should be provided by the manufacturer and not the installer, so you have greater recourse if the floor needs a major or immediate repair. This type of floor also can be refinished, as long as the dings are not too deep. If your preference is for hardwood but you worry about those dings, take a look at “distressed” styles that can disguise any new dents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: This type of floor will fade with regular exposure to sunlight, so don’t put it by a window that ushers in strong daily outdoor sun. You also need to think about exposure to moisture—say, a leak at the dishwasher or fridge, or water constantly splashed by the sink. And if your toddler drops food by the high chair, you will want to take a precaution and put a mat underneath, to prevent spotting or stains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Engineered wood</strong></span><br />
The other option in this category is engineered wood flooring, which is made of a thin veneer of real wood attached to structural plywood. It should cost a little less than solid wood, but depending on the thickness of the veneer, you may not be able to refinish it, making it not such a thrifty choice after all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Formaldehyde, used as an adhesive, can be found in some engineered wood floors, including bamboo (see below), but at the present time this chemical is not strictly regulated, so you need to inquire with the salesperson or manufacturer with regard to any floor made with pressed wood or medium density fiberboard (MDF).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bamboo</strong><br />
Although actually a grass, bamboo is sold with hardwoods for many of the same reasons—looks natural and warm, endures light to medium wear, is easy underfoot. Most bamboo flooring is made of a bamboo veneer attached to a backing such as plywood or MDF. But you need to be mindful of quality. Bamboo gets treated with many chemicals to turn it into a material suitable for flooring so off-gassing can be a factor. Also, this relative newcomer to flooring has many manufacturing sources and quality control is not yet highly regulated. Investigate thoroughly, as with any product you bring into your home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Laminate</strong><br />
This type of flooring is similar to laminate countertops, in that it is composed of dense fiberboard topped with a photographic image of a real wood (or other material) that is then topped with a clear protective layer. With the development of HD printing, laminate offers a lot of different wood looks, and you can mix several styles (e.g., a pale oak with a colored border) to achieve some fun effects. It tends to resist light scratching and fading from sunlight. And that hollow sound that turned off many homeowners once upon a time has been eliminated by many manufacturers that incorporate underneath a sound-muffling material like cork. Laminate is installed as a “floating floor,” which means there’s no glue or nails. Boards connect by means of an interlocking tongue and groove design. Since there’s no need to connect the boards to a subfloor, they can be installed over any uneven surface as long as it’s sealed and remains dry. This makes laminate a good solution till little ones are more grown up if you want to replace it eventually with tile or real wood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Laminate wears well but like wood, it won’t withstand prolonged exposure to water, and it’s slippery when wet. Also, it can’t be refinished; if there’s damage, you’ll have to replace the entire board so order extra to have an exact match if needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Resilient</strong><br />
Mostly vinyl falls into this category, but there’s also linoleum. As the term “resilient” indicates, this flooring is easy on humans, when little ones fall or adults stand for long periods when prepping a meal, and if you drop a dish, it’s less likely to break on this surface than on tile or even wood. It also handles a lot of wear or sunlight and resists stains from food and drink spills as well as crayons and magic markers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vinyl</strong></span><br />
Recent advances in manufacturing have improved performance since the days when vinyl was for your grandmother’s laundry room. You can now find vinyl that infuses the surface with cultured diamond particles for increased protection against dents, scratches, scuffs, and stains. HD printing advancements allow you to choose a vinyl that really looks like wood or tile. Peer closely, though, and you’ll know it’s vinyl, but the faux effects can be part of its fashion-forward appeal. Vinyl remains probably your thriftiest choice, depending on the pattern.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Linoleum</strong></span><br />
Linoleum is sought for its range of saturated colors or marbled effects, resiliency, slip resistance and everyday wear. It comes in sheets, for an almost seamless appearance, as well as tiles if you want a classic checkerboard or just like that look. Made of linseed oil and other naturally sourced materials, linoleum is marketed as a “green” flooring choice, but in fact, it requires chemicals, too, to arrive at the finished product, so ask the salesperson about off-gassing and VOC ratings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Both wear well but can’t be refinished. Buy extra in case of repairs so you can match the area you need to patch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tile</strong><br />
While tile comes in both ceramic and porcelain, the latter is the harder of the two and thus more appropriate for most floors that see a lot of foot traffic. Completely resistant to fading, scratches, and moisture, tile is good for a busy household. And since it’s sealed with a fired-on glaze, it’s good if allergies are an issue, but you will want to take some precautions with youngsters in the house. Until children are old enough where toddling and falling is not an issue, use a rug in areas where little ones congregate. An expansive indoor/outdoor area rug that can be taken outside and hosed off will help protect little ones while adding a splash of colorful style. Many tiles are slip resistant since they are used in commercial areas, so ask the salesperson about this rating, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caution: Dishware will break on this super-hard surface, and tile can crack if not installed by a pro on a perfectly smooth surface. A rug that protects little ones may have to be cleaned regularly.</p>
