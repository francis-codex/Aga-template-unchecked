										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating a home can be a stressful process when you do it on your own—but it can be doubly so with someone you love. When there’s cohabitating involved, balancing different styles, opinions, and taste levels can get dicey. From choosing materials and appliances to deciding what makes the punch list, determining how to merge your style with a significant other is key to making a happy home. Here, couples give us a peek into renovating together, from blending opposite styles and accommodating one partner’s “bull-in-a-china-shop” cooking habits to one project ending in an engagement!</p>

<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21723" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg" alt="White kitchen with marble backsplash" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hissan-sophias-kitchen-foyer-renovation-downtown-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hissan and Sophia</a> knew that they wanted to purchase a larger home but couldn’t see eye-to-eye on style when it came time to renovate. Instead of choosing one’s vision over the other, the couple agreed to compromise. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom molding and classic, patterned wallpaper satisfied Sophia’s taste for the traditional. And by incorporating Hissan’s preference for the industrial—reclaimed dark wooden beams and oversized matte-finish pendants—this kitchen was able to find its style sweet spot.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21721" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x896.jpg" alt="White kitchen" width="600" height="896" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x896.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lia and Chris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developed a strong point of view going into their renovation that made selecting materials, appliances, and fixtures a smooth process. However, although they share similar styles, the couple debated over a waterfall edge for the kitchen countertop and labored over the decision of whether the kitchen should remain galley-style. Their commitment to working together, especially when making tough decisions, allowed them to create a kitchen they love.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21720 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-723x482.jpg" alt="White and blue kitchen" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikki and Chris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, living through a kitchen and bathroom renovation brought the couple even closer. In combining their styles, Chris took the initiative to find vintage-inspired hardware to match their wish of a modernized, NYC prewar bathroom. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their renovation had teaching moments including trusting others to work in their home and to take care of it, discovering their own preferences, managing a budget and timeline, and learning how to compromise. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also grew closer to their community during construction as they showered at friends’ homes and brushed their teeth at local coffee shops. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21725" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg" alt="White and wood kitchen" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-11-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/becky-kitchen-renovation-clinton-hill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becky and Sarah</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spent most of the summer hiding out in their bedroom while their kitchen renovation was underway. Although living through the renovation was stressful at times, the couple didn’t just survive the process—they thrived. Their beautiful new kitchen led to an engagement. Sarah said that the renovation could have torn them apart, but in the end, it only made their bond stronger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21728" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Cara_Kitchen-Bathroom-Portrait-600x418.jpg" alt="White and wood kitchen with exposed brick" width="600" height="418" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Cara_Kitchen-Bathroom-Portrait-600x418.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Cara_Kitchen-Bathroom-Portrait-300x209.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Cara_Kitchen-Bathroom-Portrait.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-cara-and-jareds-chelsea-kitchen-and-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cara and Jared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an avid cook and a professional chef, wanted a kitchen that could handle the two of them working side by side. Together, they chose materials that would suit their needs, deciding on built-to-order cabinets to expand storage and a durable and stain-resistant counter to account for Jared’s “bull-in-china-shop” tendencies. The result? A kitchen that can truly stand their combined heat.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a specialist in kitchen renovation, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Jon</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a wildcard. He was a chef for more than 15 years, working his way all around Europe before buying two restaurants in Pennsylvania. One in an old stagecoach shop and the other in a former mill, which needed a complete renovation. He has been a full-time general contractor for about 12 years and has some solid advice on kitchen design and renovation for amateur chefs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/kitchens/3-kitchen-ideas-philly-chef-whos-also-general-contractor"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17593" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/philly-chef.jpg" alt="philly-chef" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/philly-chef.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/philly-chef-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-17585"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Focus on the refrigerator</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fridge size and location are key inputs in layout design because today’s fridges are enormous and because unlike the stove and sink, you aren’t as limited by the placement of existing gas and plumbing lines. When deciding on fridge size, consider how often you go shopping. If you’re on a weekly rotation and have a big haul, make room for a bigger fridge. If you’re in an area close to supermarkets and grocery shopping is a three-times-a-week venture, you can be more conservative on fridge size and squeeze a few extra inches in for counter and cabinet space. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might also incorporate fridge drawers if your kitchen is spacious and the fridge will be more than a few feet from prep and cooking space. Smaller fridge drawers that are quickly accessible can store staples that are handy all the time, like butter and milk. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Get a prep sink</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re installing a kitchen island, go one step further and have a prep sink added to it. It will come in handy when there is more than one cook in the kitchen, and it’s also great for families. Plus, two sinks is a huge signal to future buyers that this is a “chef’s kitchen&#8221;. While this bonus will require plumbing changes that might not be an option in condos or apartment buildings, this can be an investment that really ups the value of the space. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Plan for ventilation</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside venting systems are important for kitchens that get a lot of use. However, depending on your home—an outside wall needs to be nearby—this ventilation isn’t always possible. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A makeup air system can solve this problem. Think of it as an add-on to your existing HVAC heating and cooling system. A typical HVAC system is a closed system: it sets the air temperature and moves it around the house, and </span>no outside air gets funneled in. A makeup air system brings in fresh air from outside, but the air goes through the HVAC system before circulating so it integrates the new air with the current temperature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A makeup air system requires two parts. First, there’s a valve attached to the wall that feeds fresh air in. Second, there’s a sensor that tells the valve to open when you turn on the fan above your cooking range. That way, when you’re cooking on a hot summer day, your ventilation system will bring in air at a temperature aligned to your air conditioning. Very helpful when it’s hot outside and hot in your kitchen.</span></p>
