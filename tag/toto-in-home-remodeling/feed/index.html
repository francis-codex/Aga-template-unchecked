			<h2>Whether done in houses or co-ops, kitchen renovations for families make life easier</h2>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you have young children, you realize quickly what does and doesn’t work about the space you’re in. Common issues are a lack of storage or insufficient dining space. Perhaps you need a better flow between rooms. Or, it might be all of the above.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here, three Sweeten renovations show how parents transformed kitchens and bathrooms into spaces that work for their families—adding functionality and, of course, beautiful form to their homes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a></span><span class="s1"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>Borrowed Space Makes the Difference for a Brooklyn Kitchen</h3>

<h4>An inhospitable kitchen</h4>
<p>Betsy, a teacher, and Zach, an executive at a retail company, live in a two-bedroom, two-bath duplex garden apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The couple now has Amina, age 2, and two dogs, Tristen and Archie. Their duplex in a 19th-century brownstone was in decent shape but didn’t quite match their design aesthetic.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><span class="s4">They held off on renovating for a few years, but once Amina was born, they decided to take the plunge and finally renovate to have their home suit their ever-changing needs. They wanted to make the most of their 1,200-square-foot main floor. “</span><span class="s1">We bought knowing we would ultimately like to renovate, but the apartment was pretty updated; it just wasn’t our aesthetic,” said Betsy. “We had been living in the space for nearly three years, and the kitchen was especially difficult.” The refrigerator was apartment-sized and the peninsula-shaped design meant that only one person could be in the space at a time. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">So <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/28307#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Betsy and Zach posted their project</a> on Sweeten to find a general contractor who could help with all of their design challenges and in addition fix the poor lighting in the main living area. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Mixing old with modern elements</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To make more room and utilize the space more efficiently, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Sweeten contractor</a> reduced the size of the hall bathroom to add a bit more space to the tiny kitchen. The floors were converted from a dated yellow to a beautiful hardwood. They added a mix of traditional elements (classic hardwood floors) with a modern aesthetic (flat-panel cabinets). Multiple sources of lighting like a chandelier were installed over the main table as well as high hats to keep the open space bright and airy.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-open-kitchen-with-cabinetry" class="alignnone wp-image-50708 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8.jpg" alt="white open kitchen with cabinetry and dining nook on a hardwood flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-with-closed-cabinetry" class="alignnone wp-image-50707 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-7.jpg" alt="White kitchen closed cabinetry with cooking range and chimney over wooden flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-kitchen-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="brown-wooden-pull-out-storage" class="alignnone wp-image-50709 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-pantry-2.jpg" alt="Natural brown wooden pull out storage with for pantry after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-pantry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-pantry-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/28307-ZachBetsy-pantry-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Our Sweeten contractor was great in every small decision, from the pull-out storage options for utensils to hiding the unsightly microwave in a garage cabinet to making the fridge seamlessly blend into the cabinetry—a big feat considering we now have a 36” french door refrigerator,” said Betsy. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When asked about her advice for renovators, Betsy had this to say: “Be smart about your budget. We went with a quote that was comfortably below our bottom line, and this gave us the flexibility to spend more in certain areas and save in others without constantly being stressed about going over.”</span></p>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Seeking space to grow</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Paul, a collegiate swim coach, and Margaret, a pediatric nurse practitioner, bought their 1,</span><span class="s1">700-square-foot, two-bedroom condo, they knew they wanted to renovate it right away. “We had been living in the Heights neighborhood of Jersey City, but wanted more space for a growing family,” said Paul. “North Bergen’s mix of affordability, family-friendly amenities, and proximity to work appealed to us.” However, to make the house family-friendly, they turned to Sweeten. </span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/50727" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul and Margaret posted their project </a>on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4145" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired a general contractor</a> to renovate their kitchen. “Sweeten was helpful in showing us qualified contractors in our area,” said Paul. “Being New Jersey residents, we valued Sweeten’s referral model.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They wanted a contractor who could take their kitchen into the 21st century, updating their old laminate-and-tile kitchen into a more modern space. They wished for additional counter space as well as storage—common must-haves for a young family. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">A new layout brings high impact results</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-with-granite-countertop" class="alignnone wp-image-50717 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="White kitchen with granite countertop along with double door fridge after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-with-glass-countertop" class="alignnone wp-image-50714 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="White kitchen with glass countertop on a kitchen peninsula after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinetry-with-black-granite" class="alignnone wp-image-50716 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="White kitchen cabinetry with black granite countertop and double hung window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple worked with the firm to give their space a clean, contemporary feel without having to do a major overhaul. They didn’t remove or move any walls but they were able to reconfigure the existing layout to work better for their family. They extended the countertop and added cabinetry for additional storage. Plus, they included a nod to New York by way of a simple subway tile backsplash. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Our contractor was helpful in keeping the project moving despite material delays and the start of the pandemic,” said Paul. These first-time renovators could not be happier with their now user-friendly new kitchen. </span></p>

<h4>Reduce clutter, expand livable space</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A 1925 side-hall colonial was in need of a remodel for homeowners Jennifer and Sauyee. They made plans to live in the 1,740-square-foot home in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, for a few years before embarking on a renovation. With two small children, they wanted to make sure when they did decide to renovate that they could pinpoint exactly what was needed to make their busy lives more convenient and comfortable.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The layout lacked usable counter space and had way too many countertop appliances to be functional. Plus, the flow from the kitchen to the rest of the house needed to be reconsidered to make it more family-friendly. They also desperately wanted more usable space and a lighter, brighter vibe. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The finished product is a more modern, usable space—one that reflects the couple’s personality and everyday needs. The pantry unit is perfect for the kids’ snacks as well as additional storage for their kitchen essentials. And even though it is not as obvious as some of the other aesthetic details, the homeowners are equally appreciative of the properly vented range hood. As a family of four, cooking is very important and any cook knows a bad vent hood can be a real nuisance. So, it was an upgrade they really wanted. They chose gray Shaker cabinets, light quartz countertops, and redid the hardwood floors throughout to make a cohesive design statement.</span></p>

<p class="p1">In addition, they decided to also remodel the bathroom since the kitchen was getting a facelift. They went with a gray color palette: <span class="s5">light, marble-style tile for the floor and shower wall, with an accent dark, geometric shower floor. But t</span><span class="s1">heir favorite part? The heated floors—appreciated by the kids and adults alike. </span></p>

<h3>Learning to navigate a New York renovation</h3>
<p>A first—and obvious—lesson in renovating: it really is harder in New York. When my husband Chris and I embarked on this adventure, we thought we knew what we were doing. After all, we’d undertaken a remodel of our 1914 Seattle condo before. But that was all before we decamped to New York for work—and learned what a reno here really takes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our real estate agent brought us to a 1929 building we would have never come to on our own, smack next to the construction zone that is Hudson Yards. I was hesitant, but Chris saw a decent amount of space and a good layout in a developing neighborhood.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After moving in, we wanted to redo the kitchen, but the most urgent fix was the bathroom. An old leak from above had unmoored a section of tile, and the previous owner refused to repair it as a condition of closing. This was our first lesson in how different a Seattle and New York renovation could be.</span></p>
<h3>Deciding to do the larger renovation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our foray into a standalone bathroom remodel ended early—we got as far as finishing the design when the co-op came back with a series of unexpected plumbing requirements, chock full of things we’d never heard of like water hammer arrestors and Laticrete. The price nearly doubled, and if we were going to spend much more on a remodel, we decided we should save up and do the larger apartment renovation we had hoped to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regular re-spackling, we figured we could buy time while we saved up. That folly ended a year and a half later when, hours before leaving for vacation, a precarious section of tile came crashing down. Our super covered the crumbling wall with a plastic tarp, but it was clear: it was time to begin bidding.</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">&#8230;we raided a savings account and scrambled to add herringbone floors to the scope. The late choice delayed the project by a month, but it was one of the best decisions we made.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Finding the right general contractor with multiple skills</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We weren’t sure exactly what we needed—walls weren’t moving, but our co-op required an architect. So while we asked the initial bathroom contractor to bid, we also thankfully posted our project on Sweeten. To complete our renovation, Sweeten paired us with a design-build firm with architecture training. They also did custom millwork, making it the perfect fit for our project. Not only did the general contractor immediately understand our aesthetic, but we also had a great rapport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="lead-gray-kitchen-cabinet-hardwood-floor" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48627" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-21.gif" alt="Lead gray kitchen cabinet and open refrigerator and hardwood floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In planning the remodel, we knew we wanted to play off the building’s modest Art Deco bones, but in a way that wasn’t slavish or theme-y. We also both brought mild obsessions to the mix—for me, an inexplicable passion for English cabinetry, for Chris, a desire to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">put a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/banquettes-seating-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kitchen banquette</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in every possible corner.</span></p>
<h3>Reworking the kitchen layout</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first big choice was how to manage the kitchen layout. The room was spacious enough—designed as an eat-in when 24” of counter space seemed ample—but the two doorways weren’t in an ideal location. One opened onto the foyer and the other onto a back hallway by the bedroom. It had also been poorly updated in the intervening years: half of the footprint was wasted, with a lonely refrigerator in one corner and an errant desk in another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-kitchen-cabinets-wood-floor" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48614" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08.jpg" alt="Custom gray kitchen cabinets on dark oak wood flooring and foyer with bookcase after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location of the gas riser dashed our hopes of moving the entry to adjoin the living room, so our contractor suggested closing the smaller opening to create a wide galley with room for a banquette. This would extend the cabinetry the length of the room on one side, doubling the counter space and creating room for a wine fridge and pantry to boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we played with centering the sink and range on the counter runs, our Sweeten contractor advised against it to preserve prep space. In hindsight, we were happy to have lived in the space before renovating: symmetry looked better on paper, but from experience cooking in the space, we knew her recommendation would be more functional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep the room from feeling enclosed, we substituted upper cabinets for extra-long open shelves on one side, then tucked in under-cabinet lighting for function. The banquette capped off the space, creating both more storage and a place for friends to hang out while cooking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-foyer-full-length bookcase" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48609 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03.jpg" alt="Gray foyer with full length bookcase and brown wood floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Giving the foyer a purpose </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our foyer situation was a classic New York City conundrum: too small to do much of anything useful but large enough to be wasted if empty. We decided on a full-height bookcase that’s only 8” deep and it holds loads more than we expected. On the opposite side, our general contractor fitted narrow custom cabinets to serve as a bar. There’s just enough depth to squeeze in double rows of liquor bottles and glasses, saving precious room in the kitchen. We ran new electrical to hang art lights over tall mirrors—the goal was to make the whole space pull triple duty as an entryway, a library, and a bar—then painted the foyer and kitchen cabinetry the same deep gray so that the two spaces relate.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;">A renewed bathroom in classic black-and-white</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n the bathroom, we preserved and refinished an original tub and stuck to a classic black-and-white New York-inspired scheme with updated finishes. Given the narrow layout, the primary play here would be with subtle geometries—and taking advantage of our building’s extra thick walls. A hex marble floor worked well with the warmer white subway tile and porcelain. Our contractor recommended extending the floor tile onto the base of the walls to stretch the visual plane of the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hexagon echoed in new shower controls that help tame the notorious temperature fluctuations that come with living in an old building. In such a small space, we took a cue from hotel bathrooms and put a pedestal sink atop console legs to keep the space open. An extra-tall recessed medicine cabinet provides both storage and electrical outlets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favorite thing of all is the towel warmer which took forever to source but that I deeply love for its hex bars and Anglophilic appeal. The contractor placed it in a deep niche so that the warm rails wouldn’t risk singeing passersby. We decided to paint the walls and ceiling in a black high sheen that makes the ceiling recede and the white surfaces gleam. Strangely, of all the things in the apartment, the shower glass proved one of the most frustrating: it wasn’t installed until five months after everything else wrapped up.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Finding the budget for hardwood floors</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New wood floors were the most unexpected part of the reno. We had only budgeted for the kitchen alone. But the more floor options we looked at—and after our contractor dissuaded us from several temptations like Moroccan Bejmat tile—the more we wanted hardwood in the kitchen. That meant either putting down maple boards to match the rest of the apartment—despite disliking their color—or redoing everything. Our contractor’s opinion was that changing the kitchen floors would make one of the biggest impacts in the space. So a month into the renovation, after all the other demo was done, we raided a savings account and scrambled to add herringbone floors to the scope. The late choice delayed the project by a month, but it was one of the best decisions we made.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Becoming comfortable with flexibility </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stepping back from it now, our major lesson was in developing a deep comfort with flexibility. We found that we could be much more controlling of our remodel in Seattle than here. New York’s interminable series of permits, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-op requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and engineering reports—paired with the inelasticity of old spaces—meant we had to take a go-with-the-flow approach that made trust and an ability to laugh key. Also, best to know exactly what you’re looking for before you start to remodel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our contractor taught us the biggest lesson of all: do it all at once if you can. It’s not the disruption that’s the problem, really, or that rework ends up costing more—it’s that few of us really have the talent to create a cohesive space in small increments. Unfortunately, we didn’t quite learn this last lesson in time. During our reno, our bedroom became the storage unit for our furniture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than anything else, we were lucky to have a real partnership with our Sweeten general contractor to see us through the changes and warn us off of bad choices. We feel a bit like we’ve earned our honorary New Yorker stripes: we chose a space that we thought was a diamond in the rough and hoped we could turn it into a classic city respite. We feel like—at least to our taste—we got there, and now we have this lovely, large-living one-bedroom to come home to in one of the most dynamic parts of Manhattan.</span></p>

<h3>Wrestling with the idea of renovating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We moved to Clinton Hill over a decade ago, and always loved the neighborhood with its history of housing for returning servicemen who worked in the Navy Yard. On a total whim, we went to an open house in the Clinton Hill Co-ops and made an offer on the first apartment we saw: an 800-square-foot, one-bedroom that had been converted into a junior two-bedroom.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was frighteningly familiar with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span class="s2">Clinton Hill Co-op section</span></a> of the Sweeten website. Our neighbor also used <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to renovate her kitchen, and it looked fantastic. It seemed like a simple concept, but Jim and I were just completely overwhelmed with the idea of a renovation. Because our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment</a> really felt like it was falling down around us, we knew that we would need to change almost everything.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to look for a place upstate, hoping that more room and a home for weekend getaways would help alleviate the stress of our overcrowded and dark apartment. We made an offer on a house, had it approved, started to negotiate, and realized we needed to feel good in our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary residence</a> before we took on a second space.</p>

He was incredibly responsive and patient with us as we walked through our apartment over and over again, thinking about the best way to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open our kitchen</a>, update the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>, reconfigure our bedroom, shore up our pockmarked walls and ceiling, refinish our floors, and add storage everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We were absolutely giddy with the concept of overhead lighting! We were wired for several fixtures in the living room and kitchen, as well as recessed lights in the hallways and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. Because our apartment had been dark and crowded for so long, we gravitated toward a simple, minimalist design with white and gray paint to brighten the space and give it a clean look.</span></p>
<h3>Personalizing the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim grew up with visions of a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> island where everyone could gather</a> to eat and socialize–that became our only non-negotiable. It helped us focus our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning on the kitchen first</a>. We knew we wanted custom cabinets, so our contractor brought in his cabinet maker to meet with us and walk through the layout.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Within a week, they had sent us a 3D rendering of our new kitchen, with Jim’s dream island, plus an extended butcher block counter ideal for our boys to sit and finish homework while we cook. Our contractor suggested the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sophisticated-chalkboard-paint-ideas-4582330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chalkboard paint—now a huge hit with the kids</a>. He created a lot of extra storage under the island, including drawers for our pots and pans, plus a pantry along the extended counter. We have a dishwasher for the first time ever and love the kitchen tile.</p>

<h3>Storage reimagined</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor had the genius idea to extend our bedroom two feet into the living room, which allowed him to build a closet (we used to store our clothes in the boys’ room). It was worth the minimal loss of space to gain more storage. We also hired a closet company to build a shoe closet for us. Since our room has two windows, we decided on an <span>opaque</span> glass door to maintain some privacy, but also take advantage of the natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, kids' bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36112 " srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Our contractor came through on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the boys&#8217;<span style="color: #333333;"> bedroom</span>, our only <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directive was storage</a>, storage, storage. We wanted to find a way to keep all of their things in the bedroom, instead of spilling out into our common living areas. Once again, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our contractor came through</a> on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room, ensuring we lost very little floor space. We’re not falling all over stuff anymore!</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36200 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-13-1.gif" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, custom closets, kids' bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></h3>
<p>In the <span style="color: #333333;">bathroom</span>, we needed to keep a bathtub because we have young boys, and I insisted on a large piece of custom glass as our partial shower door. He warned me it might be difficult to reach around for the water control, but I insisted. It looks lovely, but he was right—it’s a bit of a struggle to help with bathtime.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, bathroom, shower, toilet, home, design" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36116 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Moving out during the renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our biggest challenge was realizing that, because we were <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating the entire space</a>, we would have to move out for an extended period of time. We didn’t initially budget to live somewhere else, so the added cost was a bit of a shock. After three months, we were scheduled to move back in and had left the rental, when our contractor told us he was about a week behind. Much of this delay was due to some delayed deliveries of things I had ordered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had no place to go and had to live in the apartment while there were still tools and supplies everywhere, with no appliances or kitchen counters. It was a bit uncomfortable, but not unmanageable. In hindsight, we probably should have just booked the rental for an extra week as insurance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with Sweeten made us wonder what we had waited for. We were matched so quickly with a contractor, we were able to use the website to see examples of his work, we could reach out with questions and concerns. Another upside was the Sweeten blog, a huge source of inspiration! Our new apartment is <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exactly what we had hoped for</a>: simple, comfortable, bright, and uncluttered. It feels like home.</p>

</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Michele</i></span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Getting excited to renovate</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I lead a digital product design team for a large San Francisco-based company. I’ve lived in this apartment for a little over a decade, and I had been meaning to renovate my bathroom since I moved in, but I always found a reason not to. The bath hadn’t had an upgrade since the building’s 1980s conversion to co-op! The pedestal sink wasn’t fully attached to the wall, the tub tiles were loosening, and the glass tile floor, which a previous owner had painted, was flaking.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">My apartment is on the top floor of a 1910s five-story building, and it suffered damage during a co-op-sponsored roof renovation a couple of years back. When the building’s contractor completed the repairs, I got excited about renovating. My recently acquired work-from-home job gave me more incentive. I’d updated my home office to suit the remote role, but experiencing my out-of-date bathroom all day, every day, prompted me to get planning.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Finding inspiration from other renovators</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I spent so much time on Sweeten, reading this blog, and looking at other people’s projects! It was a tremendous help seeing what other people had done. </span><span class="s5">I had strong ideas about how I wanted to proceed, but I needed help turning them into particular products, finishes, and colors.</span> <span class="s1">Sweeten provided me with a range of contractors and design-build firms who gave me numerous options. I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5415#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose my Sweeten contractor</a> because his ideas matched mine.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I’d done advance planning for the bathroom and had a clear idea of what I wanted: a floating vanity, a drop-in tub, oversized subway tile, and dramatic tile flooring. I was attracted to images of gray kitchens and bathrooms with boldly patterned floors. I envisioned something that was calm and streamlined, to make the space feel bigger and take advantage of the high ceiling. My apartment is modern and open. I wanted the bath and kitchen to feel integrated, rather than set apart from the rest of the space.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47057" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03.jpg" alt="pattern tile bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">The contractors were great at explaining problems long-distance: I’ll never forget the crew piling on a conference call about my formerly crooked bathroom wall&#8230;</span></p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A new dishwasher becomes a full kitchen remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, my plan had been to simply install a new dishwasher. Then it was suggested that a pantry could be added in the then-unused space at the kitchen’s entrance. The original kitchen plan I had posted to Sweeten was of a smaller scope, but after meeting them, I asked the contractors to submit follow-up <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bids for a full kitchen remodel</a>.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-47056 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, I worked with my contractor to come up with a plan. I put together the light and dark gray cabinets with chrome handles and found a quartz countertop flecked with both colors. I picked the same flooring that the designer had used in their showroom.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Transforming the bathroom wasn’t so hard. I saw a tile floor I liked in the sale listing of another apartment in my building and tracked it down. Finding a bathtub that would fit the small space was a challenge, but we did. (The white tub looked yellow next to the tile, so we had it reglazed.) Because of pipes in the wall, we couldn’t create storage niches in the shower, so the team extended the interior windowsill with a white quartz surface material—a shampoo perch. The floating sink is mounted a bit higher than standard because I’m tall.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A timely business trip</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The project’s biggest challenge was also something of a stroke of luck: My boss asked me to travel from New York to San Francisco, starting the day demolition began. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I stayed for almost three weeks</a>. While I was away, the Sweeten construction team kept me posted and sent pictures daily. The contractor was great at explaining problems long-distance: I’ll never forget the crew piling on a conference call about my formerly crooked bathroom wall while I waited outside an executive office at work!</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Instead of hiring a project manager, I worked as my own. I had spreadsheets for how much had been spent versus budgeted. I tracked what had been ordered, shipped, and delivered. I’m not that organized, but I turned into a full-on spreadsheet ninja. It kept me from panicking.</span></p>
<div><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-47060 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></div>
<h3 class="p5">Finishing the bathroom and kitchen renovation during COVID-19</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">By the time COVID-19 hit and the lockdown was ordered, we were 95 percent done. We had to wait for the lockdown to lift and for my building to let the crew return, clearly articulating when they would arrive, and wearing masks as required.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Eventually, we finished. After expanding my renovation’s scope, I spent significantly more than I originally intended to—close to $100,000 all told, but that includes fully updated plumbing and new floors in both rooms. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I have enough storage space in the kitchen and bathroom that nothing falls out when I open a cabinet! I love cooking; I’ve got a lot of ingredients and equipment, and it’s so nice not to feel like I’m overstuffing every corner. Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment! I’m also enjoying the dishwasher. I love the way the kitchen tile feels under my feet, and how the rooms are designed for me, with my interests and needs—even my career—in mind. That customization is the greatest luxury of the whole thing.</span></p>

<h3>A charming (but not functional) Colonial house</h3>
<p>We had been dividing our time between a farmhouse in Dutchess County and a walk-up apartment in Brooklyn. When our son was born, neither of these homes was quite suited to us. We decided to find a place in between with a shorter commute for my husband, more social opportunities for me, and easy access to the home.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg" alt="yonkers colonial house" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-45098 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p>When we first saw the house, we were charmed by the time-capsule of a kitchen—salmon Formica, dark-wood cabinets, and a dishwasher that predated the other elements. That said, we knew we would eventually update the kitchen. Having a lavatory on the ground floor and not having to run upstairs was also on the wishlist.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45113 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2.jpg" alt="Yonkers family portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19.jpg" alt="drip dishware collection" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45107" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Their Colonial renovation adds heated floors</h3>
<p>The existing kitchen had one radiator, which was buried in the back of a custom cabinet. It was a clever solution at the time, but ate up a lot of cabinet space and wasn’t heat-efficient. We decided to install a radiant floor heating system that we could run off of our existing hot-water heating system. A more formal, fully-functional <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island would offer storage</a>, outlets, and a bigger counter area.</p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17.jpg" alt="kitchen display ideas" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45105" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="kitchen with natural wood cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45101" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wanted to create a better flow of traffic and light. The main entrance to the kitchen from the dining room was a narrow 28-inch-wide doorway. It made the kitchen feel isolated from the rest of the house. Bringing down the wall would not have respected the house’s character. Instead, the opening was widened and centered between the two rooms to bring more natural light into the north-facing kitchen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18.jpg" alt="Bertazzoni stove" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45106" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen storage ideas" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45100" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Balancing the kitchen structures</h3>
<p>Some infrastructural elements dictated a lot of the design. One was that the major waste line for the three upstairs bathrooms lays along the kitchen’s exterior wall. It had been boxed out previously, and the existing cabinets had been customized around it. We didn’t want to relocate that line, so we decided to figure out how to incorporate it.</p>
<p>The second element was a sheetrock box beam of sorts. We didn’t know what was in it, but since it was asymmetrically placed and not detailed like the house’s other box beams, we assumed it was hiding something expensive to move. Our thought was, let’s give this weird beam and column matching mates to create symmetry.</p>
<h3>Odd-ball elements</h3>
<p>These design decisions hid the two odd-ball elements by making it look like they’d always been there. Bonus: We made that second column a sneaky little cabinet right between the sink/dishwasher and our espresso machine. It’s the perfect spot for drinking glasses and cups. We love it!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48250" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="Brown drip dishware" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-45099 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>I wanted to bring the warmth and softness of natural wood into the kitchen, so I chose a darker wood for the cabinets that echoes our furniture. A built-in pantry was replaced with custom open shelving. The adjustable shelves look like they might have been there when the house was built. It enhances the room’s original feel and provides a display for our brown-drip dishware collection.</p>
<h3>Turning closets into a powder room</h3>
<p>There was <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-renovations-that-added-another-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no bathroom on the first floor</a>. We combined two closets—approximately 4’ x 4’—and some square footage where we used to hang coats by the back door. The sacrifice was worth it for what would become the most frequented bathroom in the house. A pocket door with frosted glass saved space and allowed light to flow through. We installed Art Deco wallpaper, wainscoting, a picture rail, and paint in neutral tones.</p>
<p>Though manufacturers say that you can install wood flooring over radiant heat systems, it made me leery, and wood is not an efficient conductor of heat. I was certain I wanted tile, but one that wouldn&#8217;t appear cold or hard.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The right contractor for our Colonial house renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten helped us find a group of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried-and-true general contractors</a> to vet. In the past, we’d tried a few recommended by neighbors, but this time that didn’t work. And this project was too big an investment to just pick somebody out of a hat. It was great to be able to talk through everything with a Sweeten professional and get a curated list. I doubt we&#8217;d have found our contractor on our own, and I&#8217;m so glad we did.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were much more organized than contractors we&#8217;d worked with previously. Our contractor seemed to have experience and know-how beyond his years. When we ran into uncertainties, he was great at suggesting possible solutions. There was a structural issue discovered during demolition that required changes to the design layout. He was quick to help us with potential resolutions, down to providing revised elevations so we could visualize the new design. And he always discussed costs with us before we signed off. They also provided spreadsheets to help me keep track of all the elements I needed to order and have on-site.</span></p>

<h3>Veteran renovators share advice</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with our renovation was waiting for it to be finished! Time moves slowly when you&#8217;re living on the second floor of your home, feeding a family from a makeshift kitchen in your bedroom. This was no fault of our contractors. Our city building department took three months to issue our permits.</p>
<p>If you can, live with your space for a while before renovating. You&#8217;ll end up with a much clearer picture of how to make your new space work best for you.</p>
<p>Also, always budget for 10-20% more than your original estimate, especially for kitchens and baths in old houses. This is our fourth renovation experience, and there has always been a major structural or plumbing issue (or both!) that have come up. It’s never pleasant, but if you plan for it, it&#8217;s way less painful.</p>
<p>Our new space makes us feel happy! We really love all of the new millwork in the home remodel, it feels so harmonious with the rest of our beautiful old Colonial home.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Amanda and Cory, for sharing your Colonial home remodel story with us!</em></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I found a place that needed work and left me with some budget to renovate. It was challenging to work full-time and oversee the renovation. I tried to keep things simple. </span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The goal for my home was to feel peaceful and light, but I had a pretty tight budget for all that I wanted to accomplish. I focused on fairly humble materials for the renovation that I really liked and how to use them expanding on traditional neutral colors. Work is always visually intensive for me and I wanted a minimal, quiet space to serve as a backdrop for art and objects.</span></p>

<h3>Navigating the renovation plan</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’ve seen many projects through construction in my professional career. However, it never personally affected my life before. The biggest challenge was: would I be able to figure out the design of the space, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire a contractor</a>, and complete the work in the short window I had before I would have to move in? I ended up having to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">move into a construction site</a>. It was a lot to have workers show up every morning and not have a kitchen for many weeks. But you forget the hardships quickly once it’s done and you’re enjoying living there. Thankfully, my partner, at the time, and I were able to help each other through it. He has great taste and helped me the whole way through.</span></p>

<h3>Planning a mixed-materials kitchen</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Mixing wood and laminate as finishes for the cabinetry was an important idea when I was planning the renovation. It emphasizes the volumes and makes the scale a little more human. The countertops and peninsula are concrete, which I like because the material can take any form. However, it&#8217;s also a natural material for a renovation that weathers over time.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’ve always liked appliance garages. It goes back to the fact that my grandparents had one in their very modern kitchen from the &#8217;60s. </span></p>

<h3>Renovating two bathrooms</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I was especially excited about the new bathrooms and having a tub to soak in with a smoked glass panel. From the beginning, I knew the partition would not be clear glass. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44925" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5.jpg" alt="colored shower glass" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44926" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the other bathroom, the general idea was to make a very small space feel as big and open as possible. The renovation materials are pretty simple, but the details and extra showerhead make it feel more special.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2.jpg" alt="double showerheads" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44923" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-3.jpg" alt="double showerheads" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44924" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>A Murphy bed and storage</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the guest bedroom/office, the millwork is a combination of knotty pine and laminate, with a painted wood frame. The red laminate panel breaks up the finish and calls attention to the sliding door. They are both closets and shoe storage.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45036 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Matthew-Closet-Bed-22.gif" alt="renovation materials of laminate panel and Murphy bed" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I made the open shelving in the hallway myself using laminated pieces of reclaimed wood. In a way, it’s the heart of the apartment. I knew I wanted to find a spot for these shelves and the hall was just the right fit. </span><span class="s1">It turns a slice of space that wasn’t so usable into a place for display.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17.jpg" alt="custom closets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44928" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Plants were always an important component. All of the artwork is from friends and acquaintances or people in my community.</span></p>
<h3>A successful partnership with my general contractor</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractor was instrumental in completing the project and helping me do all of the things I wanted to do. At the outset, I got a lot of high bids. He was the one who convinced me it could be done within my budget. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He helped me find the millworker who did all the cabinetry. I did all the designs and drawings for them and selected all the finishes. A Murphy bed kit was purchased online and my contractor built the frame, the custom panels, and installed it.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I highly recommend working with design professionals. It’s easy to underestimate the amount of work involved. And don’t get too hung up on specific choices, sometimes it’s easier to just pick something nice that you know you like and move on. </span></p>

<h3>A full gut renovation</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When we purchased our apartment, we knew that we were going to renovate it.  As someone who loves design, I saw the potential and welcomed the opportunity to take a space and figure out how to best make it work for our family of five including three boys (and two dogs). I did not, however, anticipate we would be undertaking a full gut renovation—and while we had renovated before, those projects were a much smaller scope.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-1.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44273" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-2.jpg" alt="hiding tv idea" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44274" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Working with an architect</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before we closed on our apartment, we began working with our <a href="https://www.jwarchitecturedpc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect Jessica Wetters</a> on how to change the layout of the apartment. The plan was to open it up and improve the light and flow. The living spaces would be connected as well as add a bedroom and a half-bathroom. It was clear to our architect that the apartment required a full-gut renovation and that little could be saved. After a few rounds of revising the plans, we arrived at a layout that achieved our objectives.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13.jpg" alt="hallway" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44266" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-master-bedroom-18.jpg" alt="master bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44277" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-master-bedroom-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-master-bedroom-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-master-bedroom-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Finding the right contractor</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before we found Sweeten, we began working with a contractor on the budget for the project and costs kept going up. We were at the point where we were cutting parts of the project that were important to us (like millwork) and making compromises we weren’t comfortable with in order to stay within budget. I decided to post our project on Sweeten. It would allow me to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add more cost estimates into the mix</a> with their network of general contractors and see if I had unrealistic expectations. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg" alt="foyer" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44263" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4.jpg" alt="Henrybuilt kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44264" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sweeten matched us with three contractors, but after <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interviewing this general contractor</a>, I knew he was the one for our project. Not only did he assure us that he could get us everything we wanted within our budget, but he promised that he would minimize the disruption to our lives and work with our aggressive timeline.   </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5.jpg" alt="Henrybuilt kitchen" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44267" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As soon as we hired him, things moved quickly and once we had all of the necessary approvals, we moved into a rental apartment. Demolition began</span><span class="s2"> in February and work was completed over the summer. </span></p>

<h3>Functional and modern</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The first decision we made was the kitchen. I knew I wanted a Henrybuilt kitchen. I love the functionality and feel of our kitchen. We also planned for a black wall in the living room using huge porcelain tile slabs to camouflage our TV and it turned out even better than I expected. I researched industrial factory doors to connect the living room and bedrooms, but it was over-budget (even the reclaimed factory doors I saw were $7,000+) so I had a door made with a similar look for a small fraction of the cost.</span></p>

<h3>Replacing the floors</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In addition to opening up the kitchen, foyer, and living room, we enlarged the size of our master bathroom and added closets in unused space in the master bedroom. Throughout the apartment, we replaced the hardwood floors, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coated the walls</a>, replaced the trim, replaced all of the lighting, and added millwork.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">Even though we lived there without a kitchen which wasn’t optimal, there was no question that it would be worth it in the end. </span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When I told our Sweeten contractor that our rental ended in June and that we wanted to move back in before the apartment was completed, he worked with us to allow us to do that—despite his strong recommendation that we hold off moving in. Even though we lived there without a kitchen which wasn’t optimal—his crew set up a refrigerator in the middle of the apartment—there was no question that it would be worth it in the end. </span></p>

<h3 class="p4">The perfect finished product</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When a couple of unexpected structural issues were discovered during demo that required changes to the layout, our contractor immediately contacted our architect and me and proposed solutions that ended up improving the project. Issues that could have induced panic and delays were addressed efficiently and proactively. Our contractor, our architect, and I met at the apartment nearly every week to discuss progress and make decisions to ensure that the project kept moving forward on schedule. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are thrilled with the results. We achieved exactly the look and feel we were going for and I firmly believe that the process went as smoothly and efficiently as it did, thanks to our contractor, his crew, and our architect.  </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Nadia</i></span></p>
<h3>Keeping it together but separate</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The truth is we had a long list of desires when it came to buying our first home together. We wanted a house that was true to the time it was built, but clean and crisp and modernized. We bought it knowing that it needed a renovation, and as such lined up our contractor as we were finalizing the purchase. We wanted to start our renovation within a week of the closing and pay both mortgage and rent for no more than eight weeks. </span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44178 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20.jpg" alt="portrait, NYC, Brooklyn, construction, home renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because Stephen’s mother was moving in with us, and she is <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unable to manage stairs</a>, we needed a first-floor space for her. The house was a two-family home, with an upstairs apartment that was separate from the garden-level duplex. We decided to create a single-family house using the parlor level as entertaining space, allowing us to live separately, but together.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have a background in interior design and Stephen has renovation experience, but this was for both of us our first construction project in New York City. Our vision was of a house that would feel contiguous </span><span class="s1">but not too chopped up and not sterile. To that end, we drew lines with a well-curated mix of surfaces, and the outcome is fantastic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8.jpg" alt="townhouse living room" width="1000" height="670" class="alignnone wp-image-44177 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8-600x402.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Real hardwood floors</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house most needed a revamp on the garden and top floors along with proper bedrooms and a full-house fire/CO2 monitoring system. </span><span class="s2">Our plan was to tear out the existing fake-wood flooring on both levels and replace it with hardwood, and</span><span class="s1"> save the original floors on the parlor level</span><span class="s2">. </span><span class="s1">We chose a dark-wood flooring with a hand-scraped finish that was not ridiculously expensive. We needed it to hold up to kids, dogs, a walker, and it really has. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-7.jpg" alt="Living room" width="1000" height="1493" class="alignnone wp-image-44176 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-7-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-7-600x896.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1">On the garden level where my mother-in-law has her own ap</span></span><span class="s1"><span class="s1">artment, the foyer was updated with full marble slabs on the walls and floor. In the back,</span>the laundry room got a better egress to the backyard. Additionally, it functions as a mudroom with custom cabinetry and a pull-down drying rack where we can hang wet clothes. The bathroom received a simple replacement of fixtures and a coat of paint which changed it completely</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1">Storage in the kitchen</h3>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s amazing how much the wrap-around pantry holds.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="663" class="alignnone wp-image-44166 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13-300x199.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13-600x398.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15.jpg" alt="kitchen seating area" width="1000" height="671" class="alignnone wp-image-44168 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15-600x403.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The existing kitchen was L-shaped with very little counter space and a mobile dishwasher. As</span><span class="s1"> a big cooking family, we are very heavy users of the kitchen. By shifting the main k</span>itchen to one wall—including a dishwasher, wall oven, and a larger sink—it provided space for an island, a wrap-around pantry, and dining table.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44170 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-11a.gif" alt="pantry, kitchen pantry, wraparound pantry, kitchen, multigenerational kitchen, construction, home renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how much the wrap-around pantry holds. Since it&#8217;s the other main kitchen wall, we could only fit 12&#8243;-15&#8243; deep cabinets. Instead of upper and lowers, we installed full-height 15&#8243; upper cabinets and are able to store an enormous amount of pantry and serving items. <span class="s1">The cabinet finishes are white and acacia and topped with a highly durable quartz surface including a big, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">walk-around island</a>.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10.jpg" alt="stairs" width="1000" height="1497" class="alignnone wp-image-44165 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10-600x898.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1">Heading up to the parlor floor, we removed the stair runner and painted the stair treads, risers, balusters, and spindles in one color. We used the black paint in a flat finish on the stair boards, and a pearl finish on the railings for extra luster.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Child-Bedroom-1.jpg" alt="kids bedroom" width="1000" height="672" class="alignnone wp-image-44162 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Child-Bedroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Child-Bedroom-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Child-Bedroom-1-600x403.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Specific bathroom features</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom gut reno on the top floor focused on creating a stand-up shower. Stephen and I travel a lot for work and have huge pet peeves. We wanted to turn on the water without getting wet and have a shelf or bench to put a foot upon or sit on. We chose a glass surround with a frameless structure to make the room feel as open as possible. The custom vanity is made of walnut, with four drawers that maximize countertop and storage space. It all fits nicely in a tiny-but-functional 5’ x 8’ bathroom space.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<p><span class="s1">We ended up skim coating almost the entire house, and our Sweeten contractor worked miracles on the original plaster that was uneven and had an unappealing, thick texture. <span class="s1" style="color: #333333;">It gave us a lot more understanding of how hard it really is to properly repair plaster so that it looks like new!</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4.jpg" alt="shower seat" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-44180 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most difficult part of the renovation was the last six weeks, when we were living in the house, still under construction, with a three-year-old. Living in a space being renovated is challenging and exhausting, but our contractor staged the work so we could move in, and the crew became like family! It’s doable if you have fully functioning bathrooms and kitchen. Sweeten assisted throughout, from matching us with a contractor to providing a full bid review, and checking in about issues or concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the end, we increased the scope of what we wanted to do significantly and our costs grew—but we got it all done in the</span><span class="s1"> range of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 to $150 per square foot</a>. Doing it simultaneously means that now we can enjoy our home and our time together as a multigenerational family. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Smart upgrades for the kitchen and bathroom solve pesky problems</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When Ryan, an editor, and Sophie, a paralegal, envisioned their renovation, they knew they needed to address the problems they inherited from the “quick and dirty reno” completed in 2009, the year Ryan bought the apartment. The advantage of waiting years to renovate? “It was abundantly clear how we utilized the kitchen,” says Ryan, adding “I had 10 years to save up because even a modest renovation like this one isn’t cheap in NYC!” In their 750-square foot, prewar one-bedroom on the Upper West Side, the partners agreed that the odd-shaped kitchen needed rearranging to take advantage of every square inch; and the bathroom required rescuing from a “South Florida Grandma aesthetic.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i> To tackle <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/37791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the project, they posted</a> on </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span class="s2"><i>Sweeten</i></span></a><i>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, and </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169#overview"><span class="s2"><i>chose their contractor</i></span></a><i>. </i></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44140 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7.jpg" alt="kitchen-white-cabinets-bar seating-remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Ryan</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whoever designed the last renovation really did not think things through. In the kitchen, which is an odd trapezoidal space, the priority was maximizing both storage and counter space, and minimizing clutter. For instance, there was a 24-inch soffit between the top of the cabinets and the ceiling that was just empty space. So we knew we’d need cabinets extending to the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44150 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13.jpg" alt="renovators portrait-new york city" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sink was on a diagonal resulting in a large dead space. And the refrigerator was a huge obstruction at the back of the room and the first thing you see when you enter the foyer. Its positioning made the kitchen seem smaller and it just needed to find a new spot. We weren’t sure if that was possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom was small and dark with very little natural light. The vanity was made of builder-grade particle board that had swollen with moisture, and the medicine cabinet protruded. We were intent on transforming the look and feel of the bathroom—even the toilet was pink! The living room got a refresh with repainted walls, a replastered ceiling, and new sconce lighting.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">The contractor’s millworker was about twice the cost of </span><span class="s3">Ikea and Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, but still about $5,000 less than the cabinets in the next price tier.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the kitchen, I commissioned a one-hour consult with an interior designer, Clare of <a href="https://www.121studio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One to One Studio</a>, while still planning everything out. The designer suggested moving the refrigerator to the corner and relocating the doorway to accommodate the fit. That might seem obvious in retrospect, but to me, it was a revelation. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We went with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/product-101-kitchen-cabinet-door-materials-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinets so everything</a> would look integrated. The odd-shaped kitchen space came with difficult angles, pipes, and protrusions. We went to Ikea to experiment with a layout, but couldn’t get their premade boxes to fit in a satisfactory way. I also tried </span><span class="s3">Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, which had more options in terms of box sizes, but I worried the boxes wouldn’t be delivered in time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor’s millworker was about twice the cost of </span><span class="s3">Ikea and Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, but still about $5,000 less than the cabinets in the next price tier. He was able to build boxes that accommodated the kitchen’s unusual dimensions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen floor tile came from the designer, during our consult. I asked her specifically what I should get since I was stumped by all the options. She recommended black slate tile: durable, attractive, and cheap. Her basic ethos was “make it look expensive without being expensive.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The backsplash, on the other hand, was a splurge. We always </span><span class="s3">wanted</span><span class="s1"> scallop tiles. Initially, we envisioned a teal color but we realized it was just too loud. So we went with a scalloped tile in muted but varied gray tones. The countertop was another more expensive finish: Empira White featured veining we really liked that complemented the backsplash.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophie </span><span class="s3">wanted</span><span class="s1"> slab cabinets without any pulls, and I agreed. By then, I was really <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-selecting-and-ordering-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suffering from decision fatigue</a> and didn’t have the wherewithal to evaluate the merits of different cabinet hardware!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophie chose the kitchen to be clean and streamlined, whereas I wanted the bathroom to have quirkier touches. I put together a sort of mood board where we considered a bunch of looks like intricate marble mosaics, but marble stains and needs a lot of upkeep. Plus, our contractor recommended we get large-format tile, due to some peculiarities of the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We ultimately chose 36”x36” glazed porcelain tile that looks like marble at about $4/square foot, which was pretty reasonable, especially since we tiled up to the ceiling. It also worked well on the floor given the bathroom’s size constraints.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The vanity was more of a splurge, but I justified it because I hadn’t seen other vanities quite like it. And it fit. A 25-inch vanity would have been too small, and a 30-inch vanity would have been crammed in. The Goldilocks vanity needed to be between 25 to 30 inches, but powder room vanities sit comfortably within that range. I just had to pay twice what I’d initially budgeted. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-white-bathtub"  class="alignnone wp-image-44065 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1.jpg" alt="white bathroom with white bathtub and white vanity with stand and large frameless mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The renovation itself mostly went off without a hitch, from getting board approval to designing it to seeing the project through to completion. Our contractor helped a lot with the paperwork. Between the management company and the board, there were A LOT of forms that I needed to put together. Luckily, the contractor had worked in the building before, which is one of the reasons I hired him. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor was really good at keeping me in the loop and letting me know what was happening and when. Managing and communicating expectations is a big part of a successful partnership. Have a plan before you hire a contractor, know what you want and why you want it, so you’ll have a better idea of where to compromise with your decisions and where not to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the renovation, my downstairs neighbor was particularly helpful. She winters in Florida, and let us stay in her apartment, meaning we didn’t have to find a place to crash. I work from home most days, so I could stay in the building and check out the renovation throughout the day to make sure we were adhering to the plan. Also, I didn’t have to find a place to board my cat, Titus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Besides the clean look, I love how our new kitchen is all integrated. From a functionality standpoint, I’m very pleased with its usability. It easily accommodates two people working at the same time, has tons of storage space and counter space, yet still seems open.</span></p>

<h3>A couple&#8217;s journey to the ideal railroad-style apartment</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For every homeowner, there are certain household features that just aren’t negotiable: from space layout to square footage and modern features. Some owners are willing to do whatever it takes to make sure their home matches their preferences, which was certainly true for Lavanya and Regis, a couple who had to try (and try again) before finding a space that truly felt like home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They had sold an apartment that she had loved, and proceeded to buy and move into another that they both really disliked. Lavanya, the executive producer for Artifex Productions, a New York City-based production company, decided to give it another try, saying, “We were on the hunt for something like the old place.” </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="lavanya-with-her-dog" class="alignnone wp-image-57478 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-portrait-1.webp" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowner" width="600" height="900" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-portrait-1.webp 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-portrait-1-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The renewed search was for a railroad-style layout with distinct spaces that could serve different purposes for home and business activities. When she and her partner Regis, who manages an NYC-based restaurant, and Frankie, their 11-year-old Jack Russell terrier, saw it, they knew it was the one. They snapped up the railroad apartment and <span class="s2">posted their project</span> to find<span class="s2"> a <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor </span>to help them implement their vision for their unusually shaped home.<i> </i></span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-dining-12.webp" alt="Living and home office space with white floors" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-57472 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-dining-12.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-dining-12-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-dining-12-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-8.webp" alt="White kitchen with white floors" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone wp-image-57476 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-8.webp 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-8-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The railroad apartment, a long-skinny layout, was introduced in New York City in the mid-19th century. The style, also referred to as a “floor-through,” is known for its small, narrow rooms. However, with some help, a railroad apartment can become the perfect layout for a couple with at least one work-at-homer. Lavanya knew from the first apartment she and her husband had that a long, rambling railroad-style flat could be configured to create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-bronx-rowhouse-remodel-for-work-life-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private office for her to work in</a> without feeling like the rest of their home life was overlapping with her space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They found their new apartment in South Park Slope, Brooklyn. The two-bedroom condo was 700 square feet and, as is typical, stretched from the front of the prewar building, built around 1910, to its rear. One thing railroad-style apartments are known for is the immodest “bathtub in the kitchen.” While there was no tub in theirs, the overall layout still didn’t fit the couple’s day-to-day needs, and would still plan to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revamp their apartment&#8217;s flow</a>.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-6.webp" alt="White and wood kitchen" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone wp-image-57474 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-6.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-6-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-kitchen-6-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="s1"></span></p>
<h3>Planning a railroad apartment renovation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Lavanya and Regis signed their Sweeten contractor, they understood that they would need a six-month renovation to cover work across multiple rooms. To begin with, the railroad-style condo was strangely configured: the primary bedroom was at the apartment’s back end, far from the bathroom, and next to it was the dining area, which, as the former owners had it arranged, was separated from the living area by the kitchen. To the couple, the apartment’s arrangement felt backward. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">To help the couple, their contractor recommended Jennifer Levy of <a href="https://www.cavdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAVdesign Interiors</a> to make sense of the space they were working with and create the right flow that would work for them. </span><span class="s1">The team decided to <span class="s2">flip the layout</span> so that the area that had been the living room would become their bedroom. The rear bedroom, which was large, would become a living area and office. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bedroom-11.webp" alt="Bedroom after the renovation" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone wp-image-57468 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bedroom-11.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bedroom-11-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bedroom-11-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="s1">[P]ocket and barn doors&#8230;saved a ton of space and made our whole home feel modern and cool.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We needed to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fix the kitchen</a> which had issues including old, honey-colored wood cabinets and a layout that was far from its efficient capacity. The floors throughout the apartment were uneven and stained a reddish color which felt outdated. Their goal was to make the main rooms bright and airy by integrating glossy white-painted wood floors, built-in storage, and recessed lighting on dimmers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next up was <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redesigning the bathroom</a>. The tub had been shoved into a corner and closed off by an unattractive partial wall, creating a very narrow and dark opening. The toilet and sink were installed too close together and the bathroom had minimal storage. Ultimately, the duo wanted to reconfigure the room to create a more spacious, spa-like environment. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57466 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bathroom-9.webp" alt="Bathroom remodel with wooden cabinets" width="600" height="900" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bathroom-9.webp 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-bathroom-9-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3>Kicking off the work with a Sweeten expert</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their Sweeten contractor installed solid oak wood floors and painted the planks with high-performance floor paint. They ran into challenges while updating the lighting when the electricians realized that installing the dimmable lighting would require replacing the wiring to bring it to code. This ended up creating many new holes in the walls, which then needed to be patched and skim coated putting the project behind schedule. One bright consolation was the brand-new dimmer switches—one of their favorite features.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen was a success</a> without many problems to solve. The contractor suggested hiding the refrigerator, freezer, and dishwasher behind panels that matched the cabinetry. The room was spacious enough that their new <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">washer and dryer</span></a> found their place behind a closet without conflict. The finishing touches included handmade tiles for the backsplash and a custom butcher-block counter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-closet-2.webp" alt="The entryway to the apartment" width="601" height="900" class="alignnone wp-image-57470 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-closet-2.webp 601w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-closet-2-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lavanya was especially excited about the closets custom-designed for the bedrooms, with sliding shoe racks to accommodate her self-professed “footwear addiction.” That organizational theme continued on many of the interior thresholds with pocket and barn doors; this idea, which their contractor embraced, saved significant space and made their whole home feel modern and stylish.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom planning process</a> was a collaboration between Lavanya and Regis who enjoyed both the creativity and end result. They opted for a hand-poured concrete floor and custom cabinets, along with luxurious hand-made tiles for the shower and a deep, cast-iron soaking bathtub (a non-negotiable for the couple.) New shower fixtures, including a rain showerhead, a towel heater, and a dimmable backlit mirror pulled it all together. </span></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-sliding_door-3.webp" alt="Roller top barn door" width="601" height="900" class="alignnone wp-image-57479 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-sliding_door-3.webp 601w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lavanya-sliding_door-3-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" />An in-sync partnership produces great results</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every step of the way, their Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor was fantastic</a>: “Relaxed and professional from the outset, he <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped me stay calm</a>, even when delays and surprise expenses came up. The electricians and plumbers were exceptional as well,” said Lavanya. During the renovation, their contractor came up with ideas to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep costs at the right place</a> and also substituted some expensive ideas with affordable ones.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We love our gleaming floors and the brightness of the rooms, and our beautiful, modern bathroom. It’s like we live in a white palace!” Lavanya shared. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you, Lavanya and Regis, for sharing your space with us!</i></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I’m shocked by how long it took us to renovate,” the owner of this Westchester, New York, home said. “You know what they say about having kids, though: <i>The days are long but the years are short</i>.”<i> </i>The house, at 5,500 square feet, was also large, and in great, if not quite stylish, condition. It felt livable, and that’s why these finance execs-cum-parents of now high-school-age daughters put the finishing touches on their renovation nearly a decade after buying it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They did it by listing the project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Sweeten</span></a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors, combing through bids and hiring <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">this design-build firm</span></a>. The result: an eclectic redo that delivered this trad home straight into the 21st century.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The single-family house, built in the early 1960s, is like many in this Westchester County suburb. Its layout featured a formal entry hall and a dedicated dining room, plus <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a finished basement</a> that boosts the total square footage. When the family of four and their pets moved into the home, it had just received a round of pre-sale renovations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kids were in elementary school. “We always knew we’d update it and make it more our style at some point,” the owner said, “but we weren’t in a rush.” They’d lived happily in Manhattan for 15 years, and then in a rental in Scarsdale for three more before committing to the new home. “We wanted,” said the owner, “to live in our home long enough to find a clear vision.”</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">When the goal of the project crystallized, it was fairly simple: They wanted to preserve the home’s great bones and traditional features—including old hardwood floors, large windows with a diamond grill pattern, some stained-glass touches—and blend in a modern-classic feel. Some plans were solely functional. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The bathrooms, which had not been renovated since the home was built, were outdated and slated for a full redo. But the rest of the house would get a gentle, progressively modern update that would play off and enhance what was already there.  They decided to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/renovate-home-once-pieces-expert-192016677.html?guccounter=1">renovate their whole home at once</a>, instead of in pieces. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43506 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-stairs-04.jpg" alt="Foyer stairs" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-stairs-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-stairs-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-stairs-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">We now have three rooms with different patterns of wood floor.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We were excited about the job as a whole,” the owner said, but “relieved to know we could do a lot just by just adding a few touches.” In the end, they did a bit more than that. The home’s spacious foyer, already a stunner, got a dramatic makeover, featuring daring large-slab marble tile and a deco-style beaded chandelier. Those bathrooms got their gut-jobs, redone with glass-walled showers, gleaming fixtures, and statement lighting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The mudroom received a sleek redesign, with functional storage, and whimsical bright-blue penny-round floor tile. And the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/product-101-kitchen-cabinet-door-materials-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen received a playful update</a>, with a painted hardwood floor, a boldly mirrored backsplash, and a wraparound marble overlay on the existing peninsula providing a stylish second life for the high-end cabinetry that was already there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The process, the owner warned, was grueling at times, especially since the family of four lived in the house throughout. “We expected some inconvenience—especially since we have a dog and a cat—but it was a big challenge,” the owner said. “Towels and blankets under doors went a long way, but dust found its way around.”</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite inconveniences, the project also bore happy surprises, like the ugly, thin carpet in the office that lifted to reveal a beautiful parquet floor. The Sweeten contractor cleaned it up and stained it white, which markedly opened the space. “We now have three rooms with different patterns of wood floor,” the owner says. While to some this might sound like a nightmare scenario, these little-bit-of-everything-loving homeowners find the mixed-up style “very cool.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because one never knows when a gorgeous discovery will save the contractors a few days’ effort, this homeowner suggests taking time to map out the renovation process in detail, with contingencies. </span><span class="s1">And ask for the tough love you need to maintain your timeline: ordering deadlines for materials so you’ll have them before they’re needed; assignments for moving things around the house as work carries on. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Our contractor,” the homeowner says, “was patient and thoughtful about what needed to be ordered. More important, he completed work on time, if not early. He was easy to work with, responsive and flexible. We also knew that, should that attitude change, Sweeten had our backs.”</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Opportunities for efficiency and satisfaction can be found by playing an active part in the project, the homeowner said. Living in the house throughout the process, he says, allowed the family to see it day-to-day. “My favorite part,” he said, “was watching the rooms finish one by one and seeing the larger picture slowly emerge.” </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the end, he said, the family stayed close to their budgeted figures and felt real satisfaction in the job’s completion. “It’s great to be done and the house finally feels like our home,” he said. “The vision we had came together, and now we can build on it with details like family photos and objects we love.”  </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span class="s1" style="color: #76808f;"><i>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Gordon</i></span></p>
<h3>A new start for an old home</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our home, a brick townhouse in the Sunnyside Garden Historic District, was built in 1925 in one of the first planned communities inspired by the <span class="s2">English Garden Movement </span>in the United States. This enclave in the borough of Queens was originally developed to promote green space and community while providing affordable housing to working-class folks. Tracy, a financial analyst, and I, a teacher, had been living in the neighborhood for some time when we purchased the house, a former rental that hadn’t been improved since the early ‘90s. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/">We had a lot of ideas for updating it</a>.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">We felt lucky to find a three-story home of roughly 1,200 square feet, or 400 square feet per floor. The townhouse had three bedrooms and two bathrooms, and that was more than enough for the two of us, our cats, Laurel and Juniper, and our dog, Ballou. We wanted to gut-renovate both baths and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overhaul our underutilized basement</a>. If we could squeeze in maximum function on every level, the house would feel more modern and bigger.</span></p>

<h3>Remodeling a landmarked townhouse</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We had <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/">renovated the kitchen</a> just after buying the house four years ago. The job, a mix of DIY projects and subcontractor commissions, was successful but laborious. We were recovered and ready to tackle the next phase, but understood that <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">the difficulty of the work would exceed our own abilities</a>, as would the red tape. Because we own a landmarked building, we would have to secure not only the expected Department of Buildings paperwork but also obtain Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) permits and approvals on all work impacting the building’s exterior. We knew our general contractor would assume much of this burden, which made us feel more comfortable diving in.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">We dreamed of a polished concrete floor but settled for large, matte concrete-effect tiles instead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p></blockquote>

<h3>Giving new life to the basement</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of the whole renovation, the basement would be the larger piece, the goal was to increase the house’s usable space. Before we started, the basement was a large, unlevel room. Thanks to the old home’s process of settling, there was a two-inch difference in floor height from the walls to the room’s center. It had an outdated bathroom and poorly planned utility areas. A previous owner had installed an awkwardly placed cabinet and sink in the middle of the big room, and the washer and dryer next to the 40-year-old boiler, making laundry day a sweaty affair. The basement bathroom was dark and dank. We wanted to recreate the basement as a study, gaming/movie space, music center, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/healing-home-space/">cat sanctuary</a> with storage, laundry, and a hospitable second bathroom.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<h3>A Queens basement remodel to be livable</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We started in the downstairs, where we first had to level the floor. We dreamed of a polished concrete floor but settled for large, matte concrete-effect tiles instead. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/">The cost and challenge of doing a poured floor</a> just didn’t make it practical, and we were ultimately happy with an alternative that gave the room a similar feel at a lower cost. After losing two inches of headspace in the leveling of the floor, our Sweeten contractor suggested raising the ceiling by exposing and painting the heating pipe—easy, since they were replacing the room’s drywall, anyway. A new basement door, window, and vents for the bathroom and boiler room were installed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next, they subdivided the space, creating a new living area, a storage room, and an expanded bathroom. LPC approvals, necessary for the new exterior basement door and window, as well as bathroom and laundry venting, went through smoothly.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That leads me to the renovation’s second and equally important part: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/">the bathroom remodels</a>. The basement bath would get a complete gut job to remove a creepy stall shower, and an expansion to make room for a freestanding bathtub. The windowless downstairs bathroom needed to be bright and clean. We went for a spare look, choosing large wall tiles, a custom concrete sink, and a wall-hung toilet, in addition to the beautiful bathtub. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">A tub-turned-shower for the master bath</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our upstairs bath would also be gutted and refreshed, with a glass-walled shower replacing the old tub-and-shower setup. We couldn’t make the</span><span class="s3"> 30-square-foot room bigger, </span><span class="s1">but <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/renovation-tips-bigger-bathroom/">we could up its storage and functionality</a>. Upstairs, we went for a modern toilet and a compact, wall-mount sink, along with a recessed medicine cabinet, and toothbrush niche. We installed rectangular wall tiles vertically for a playful effect. Both baths got recessed lighting.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><em><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42840 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3.jpg" alt="black hexagon bathroom floor tile, clear shower doors" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(Above) &#8220;After&#8221; upstairs bathroom</span></em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it was finally time to finish the basement, we were excited to be able to install the shelving system ourselves; the contractor made it easy by mounting wood blocking between the wall studs. <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/">We wanted built-ins</a>, but the wall-shelving was more cost-effective and looks great. We offset neutral surfaces with books, wood accents, and colorful velvet furnishings. One takeaway we agree on: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/">Don’t cheap out on hardware</a>; the difference shows as it wears.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The only downside, in the end, was that the price of the project came in much more than we anticipated after we had to replace the boiler and a rotted drainpipe. Once we finalized the task list, though, our Sweeten contractor stuck to the budget. Doubling our living space has had such an impact on our daily life. We don’t have a single regret!</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Ashleigh and Jonathan were renting an apartment in the Financial District of Manhattan while leasing out their own house in New Jersey, when they decided they’d rather own their everyday home. The couple sold their place across the river with the intention of buying an apartment in New York City. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They found a 953-square-foot studio loft in DUMBO, Brooklyn, which was originally built as a soap factory in 1904. Since the place didn’t come equipped with a laundry hook up, they’d planned to have one installed to add a washer and dryer to their bathroom. Unfortunately, the couple <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">didn’t realize what that upgrade would involve</a>. “We had no idea that this next step would necessarily require renovation, however, we fell in love with the apartment, and figured out a way to make it work,” Ashleigh shared. </span></p>

They were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who Sweeten shared was already working on another project in the same building. “That was a large factor in us deciding to go with him for the renovation,” Ashleigh said. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="brass-fitting-over-white-bathtub" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48744 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-03.jpg" alt="Navy blue paint and white subway tiles and brass fittings over white bathtub after renovation" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-03.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-subway-tiles-laundry-niche" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48742 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-01.jpg" alt="White subway tiles and blue paint in bathroom and laundry niche with washer dryer after renovation" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-01.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" />From the onset, the contractor knew timing was tight—since the couple had to be out of their rental in the Financial District by a non-negotiable deadline. “Right off the bat, he told us to only consider items that were in stock and not special order so that we could avoid unnecessary delays, which definitely guided us down a somewhat limited path when selecting tile, fixtures, etc. He was also very helpful in making design suggestions, such as what direction the herringbone tile should be installed, how many recessed lights we needed, door/molding choices, etc,” Ashleigh shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowner’s first decision? The unfinished wood vanity with a Carrara marble top. From there, they chose the aged brass and gunmetal fixtures, classic white subway tiles, and navy paint for the walls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once their contractor filed the necessary plumbing and electrical permits, all they could do, construction-wise, was wait. “He assured us that he was doing everything he could to make this happen and stayed in constant communication, keeping us informed on how things were progressing with our permits, as well as letting us know when he needed certain items for installation,” Ashleigh said. Once they came through, he had a month less than planned to complete the project—but all-in-all the renovation wrapped up just two days behind schedule. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41960 size-full" title="bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05.jpg" alt="washer and dryer in bathroom" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05-585x878.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05-1170x1755.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-subway-tiles-brass-shower-head" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48746 mb-24&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05-scaled.jpg" alt="White subway tiles and little shower niche with brass shower head and shower valve over white bathtub after renovation" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jonathan-Orlando-Bath-05-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This wasn’t exactly Ashleigh and Jonathan’s first renovation—but their first with <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a licensed general contractor</a>. “His experience and expertise helped guide us through the process,” Ashleigh said. Sweeten reached out during the process and offered assistance, but the couple noted they actually didn’t need any further help and that everything was moving along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We absolutely love our new bathroom. Given the limited space, it suits our needs and style perfectly. We&#8217;ve lived with and without a washer/dryer and much prefer life with one, so the fact that we could solve that problem with the apartment makes it infinitely more livable for us.” Ashleigh said.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Their Sweeten contractor also built a walk-in closet out of the remaining alcove space. </span></p>

<h3 class="p5">Landing the perfect space</h3>
<p class="p4">We had a clear vision from the day of the close: to create a living space with a look and feel of casual luxury. The building, in historic DUMBO, is a block from both Brooklyn Bridge Park and the waterfront. The apartment is a true two-bedroom—with windows and natural light in both—overlooking the street and trees. The price point was reasonable enough that we could buy the condo and have money to renovate before moving in. Mitzie is a furniture designer and we were confident the space was a good canvas. It would make a good home.</p>
<p class="p5"><b><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16.jpg" alt="open concept kitchen and living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41443" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></p>
<h3 class="p5">New home office, featured wall panels, coordinated bathrooms</h3>
<p class="p4">We were looking to add character to each room, with a focus on mixed materials and quality finishes. We were excited about renovating the kitchen as well as two bathrooms using the same tile in different ways. The master bedroom would be outfitted with wall paneling. Maximizing storage was key since Mitzie works from home. The second bedroom would be her workspace, and she wanted (needed!) to separate work from life with an office. We were determined to accomplish it all, transforming the condo into a home reflecting both our personalities and styles.</p>

<h3>A mood board emerges</h3>
<p>Once we’d hired our Sweeten contractors—and asked a lot of questions about costs and the timeline—we began with concept boards. These kept us organized with the number of decisions we had to make throughout the planning. We started with a set of detailed floor plans and measurements (CAD renderings were helpful for seeing the big picture). The color palette was off-white, blue, and gray, with accents of pink in textiles and black for hardware. We created a list of materials we wanted to incorporate such as marble, brass, and wood. All of these hues and surfaces are visible in our living room, which is the heart of our place.</p>

We installed <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/should-i-refinish-my-hardwood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white oak wood floors</a> throughout the apartment to lighten up the entire space. It has a subtle, scraped texture that feels wonderful to walk on barefoot. Since the same wide floorboards were used throughout the apartment, we eliminated the saddles at our door thresholds to maximize that continuity. We made a schedule for ordering materials and a checklist for received items—a system that carried us through the renovation, helping us track appliances, fixtures, hardware, and odds and ends.</p>

<h3>The key to open concept spaces: built-in cabinets</h3>
<p>The kitchen was a dark and boxy room that needed love. Our goals were to maximize storage, update the appliances, and simplify the overall aesthetic. This was especially important as the kitchen opens to our living room. A large island was a key addition, to function as a dining and entertaining area. We chose a refrigerator and freezer with panel doors matching the cabinets. On the other end of the kitchen wall, our contractors removed the door frames holding the washer/dryer for a streamlined effect.</p>

<h3>Wall paneling defines a plain wall</h3>
<p class="p1">Wall paneling was added to give our bedroom depth and character which became a feature. This accent wall moved the attention away from some existing buildouts in each corner of the room, and a recessed area that could not be reconfigured. Our contractors hired a master carpenter who created the wall paneling with 2 1/2&#8243;-wide lengths of plywood, and finished the wall with satin-finish paint. In this room as well as the second bedroom, which became Mitzie’s office, we added custom closets and remote-control blinds. Mitzie’s plants in her office were outfitted with grow lights to keep them green year-round.</p>

<p>We found a great tile company and chose the same style for the floors in both bathrooms but installed in different patterns. Our big goal for the master bath was to add a double vanity—a tight squeeze and ultimately a feat, since we didn’t find a 60-inch-wide unit with storage that we both liked. The vanity we chose has no cabinets, but luckily, during demolition, our contractors pointed out an extra 6-8&#8243; in depth between the wall studs—space for hidden storage. The carpenter who’d created the bedroom paneling custom-made a four-door, concealed built-in. The shower recesses and door saddles are cut from the same marble slab as the kitchen countertops.</p>

<h3>During the renovation process</h3>
<p>Throughout the renovation, our Sweeten general contractor proved critical in the job’s technical aspects. Their invaluable suggestions included creating a dropped ceiling to add recess lighting, hiding wires and cables, adding electrical sockets and USB plug-ins, and installing dimmers. Our apartment was filled every day with a team of busy contractors and subcontractors, including painters, an electrician, a carpenter, and a plumber. It surprised us, but once the project was complete, we missed seeing and chatting with these talented guys. Sweeten helped us find our renovation team and advised us on important points like timelines and communication strategies.</p>

Mitzie and I didn’t know how hard conveying a bathroom-tile design over FaceTime could prove—the flooring almost broke us up! But a five-month renovation is survivable, even when in the end you are living out of a suitcase at a dear friend’s house. In the end, we were thrilled with our relaxed and beautiful apartment and proud of our role in making it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nearly 25 years ago, the homeowners were on the hunt for a three-bedroom rental with more space for their two children—who’d long been sharing a bedroom. They stumbled upon a Chelsea apartment, converted from a factory space, that was actually for sale. They agreed to go through with buying their first place—where they’ve lived ever since. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the couple had their kitchen renovated, but left every other room intact—until they decided to remodel the guest bathroom. “It was embarrassingly retro. The faucets didn’t work, there was a gap behind the sink. It just looked old,” they shared. Another priority? To convert the bathtub into a walk-in shower. “My dad, who is in his 90s, stays with us a lot, too,” one of the homeowners shared, so that update was especially important to give him easier access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/admin/projects/32293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project to Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4845#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who would provide design and build help to modernize the space. Guidance picking out and sourcing materials was the main factor in their decision. “Other contractors facilitate the project, file the permits, demolish, install, etc—but then I would’ve had to go find the sink, the toilet, the faucet. This contractor offered to help us find all of our materials, it was part of their service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img decoding="async" title="beige-bathroom-wall-tiles"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48774 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Beige bathroom wall tiles with white pedestal sink along with white bathtub and toilet before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><strong>After</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Before work could begin, the building’s co-op board engineer presented a list of possible requirements, from waterproofing to disability access.  The contractor had to apply for a lot of permits, and at one point in the process, the Sweeten Client Services team stepped in to facilitate an issue and get communication between the homeowner and contractor back on the right track.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubNuCmtu1M8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the approval and permits were all set, the couple and their Sweeten contractor got to work on finding materials that aligned with their vision of a clean, classic black-and-white bathroom. They all went to a showroom together to see what caught the renovators’ eyes, including a dotted marble floor tile. The homeowners love natural stone material, so they opted for a Calacatta porcelain tile for the shower walls. The vanity is a custom piece that ties in the bi-tonal color palette and offers plenty of storage. An offset sink (we’re seeing more and more of these) lends one side of the counter for more storage, too.</span></p>

The contractor&#8217;s designer was the perfect partner for us,” they shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contracting team was diligent about cleaning up the dust every single day since the homeowners were living at home during the renovation. The guest bathroom is near the entryway and was cordoned off for construction. “They all took the job seriously, completed the job with meticulous work, and got it done pretty quickly. We saw real care,” the homeowners said. </span></p>

<p>Nellie, who works in television, and Lauren, a designer, had a nagging thought every time they paid their rent: their hard-earned money could go toward their mortgage rather than paying for someone else’s.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-19.jpg" alt="couple portrait" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-41403 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-19-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-19-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With the looming closure and repair of their main transport artery, the L subway line in Brooklyn, they finally took the plunge and bought an apartment. The 700-square-foot, one-bedroom co-op was built in Jackson Heights, Queens, in 1936. “It’s a peaceful vibrant neighborhood that we’ve come to really enjoy,” Nellie said. (As fate would have it, a job relocation brought the couple to Minnesota following the purchase and renovation, so they maintain their Jackson Heights pad as a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pied-à-terre in NYC</a>.)</p>

<p>The apartment’s initial appearance was bland and uninspired, calling for <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opening up the kitchen</a>, giving the living room more flow, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updating the bathroom</a>. A fire a few years earlier had destroyed much of the original prewar detail, which took the pain out of the couple’s decision to modernize the space. “Our style, in general, is modern, so we like clean lines and black accents,” Nellie said.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evaluating the whole apartment</a>, it also felt too compartmentalized; opening it up would make a smaller home feel big and airy. To execute their remodel, they posted their project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/queens-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor in Queens</a> to create their vision.</p>

The contractor <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began the work in the kitchen</a> opened it up to the living room and added cabinetry that went to the ceiling and wrapped around the new, wider opening. “This afforded us extra storage space,” Nellie said. “We even fit a dishwasher, which we never had in previous apartments, so that was exciting.” The space was also outfitted with semi-custom Italian cabinets and a hidden pullout trash can (a big plus for Lauren and Nellie).</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-04.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-41388 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>In the bedroom, the first port of call was the closet—there wasn’t any storage in the room. Nellie and Lauren picked out something large, but simple from Ikea. Their general contractor installed it but needed to shift the entrance to the bedroom to accommodate it.  “It was our contractor’s idea to add some molding at the bottom and frame it on the sides to make it look built-in,” Nellie said. Custom knobs also elevated the wardrobe’s appearance.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41396 mb-0 size-full" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-12.jpg" alt="bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>

At the time of the renovation, the couple had three cats. “We turned the bottom of a hallway closet into their food and water area and a little hideout,” Lauren said. There was also a specialized spot to hide the litter box.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning the bathroom</a>, Nellie and Lauren originally dreamt of a walk-in shower. Instead, they opted for a sunken tub with a hinged glass door. Although the couple’s aesthetic was modern, they gave a nod to the apartment&#8217;s prewar roots by installing classic subway tiles on the walls and black hexagon floor tiles.</p>
<p>Their contractor discovered that much of the shower wall could be pushed back four inches. Where the wall couldn’t be pushed back, he added a handy ledge right next to the shower with a niche shelf to store items. Previously, the bathroom door had swung in. Nellie and Lauren envisioned a pocket door to reclaim some of that space. However, wiring in the walls made this impossible. Instead, they opted for a barn door (they also added a barn door for the bedroom near the apartment entrance).</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41397 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-13.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Nellie-Dumont-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The couple decided not to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live in the apartment during the renovation</a>. “We had heard that living in a space during a reno can be stressful,” Nellie said. “and we knew we wanted to renovate, so we extended our rental lease.” They did move in with an incomplete kitchen. “We set up a makeshift kitchen with a folding table and just ate takeout and food from an air fryer for maybe three months,” Nellie said. &#8220;We did dishes in the bathroom sink.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" class="elementor-button-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Connect with Sweeten contractors</span></a><br />
The entire apartment was painted white for a bright backdrop. Voice-activated ceiling fans—“I’m kind of a tech junkie,” Nellie said—have proven perfect for both summer and winter. To further open up the apartment, the duo removed a wall that separated the foyer from the living space to allow natural light to flow into that area. Initially, they didn’t know what to do with the space and eventually turned it into a small seating area. “I think where we’ve landed now makes sense, but it took some time to get there,” Nellie said.</p>

<p>Lauren and Nellie loved the whole renovation process, although decision fatigue did set in towards the end. “You don’t realize how many decisions there are to be made,” Nellie said. One bit of advice the couple has for other first renovators is to be prepared for your project to take longer than planned.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working with their Sweeten contractor</a>, Lauren and Nellie are “thrilled” with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final results of their new home</a>. They see their new-look apartment as an embodiment of who they are as people. “It’s quirky and fun and colorful and modern—all of our favorite things,” Nellie said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A family of four didn’t have to look far to find their brand new home</h2>
<p><em>They say that a little can go a long way, and that proved true for one Upper East Side couple who, looking to expand their living space, set their sights on a smaller one-bedroom apartment next door. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Posting their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, they were paired with both a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3341#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten architect</a> as well as <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten contractor from a design-build firm</a>. Together, they were able to turn 700 extra square feet into the master bedroom, den, closets, and living/dining room their growing family needed.</em></p>

<p>A few factors came together to set this project in motion: For one, 1,100 square feet can start to feel tight with two growing teenagers. Our boys had been sharing a room and the need for more personal space was apparent now that both were in high school and required designated areas where they could do things like homework. We were also looking to host friends and family more often, which we rarely did since our original living/dining room could only accommodate a few people at a time.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apt-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41062 size-full" title="before and after floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apt-Floorplan.jpg" alt="before and after floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apt-Floorplan.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apt-Floorplan-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apt-Floorplan-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>When the couple next door decided to sell their one-bedroom apartment and move back to England, it seemed like a unique opportunity and the perfect way to get the extra space we needed. Plus, it would allow us to stay in the building and neighborhood we really liked—a smallish co-op located on a lovely block in the East 70s on the Upper East Side of New York City. So we bought it.</p>

<p>We were not <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/first-time-renovators-stories-vol-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-time renovators</a>—we had previously remodeled the kitchen—but the scale of this project was much larger than our earlier ones. Sweeten was invaluable in helping us attract several potential design partners that we never would have found otherwise. Our goal was to leave as much of our original apartment intact as possible, knocking out the separating wall and combining it with the one-bedroom that we purchased to create a den, closets, and a larger living/dining room, and a master suite on the opposite side of the apartment from the boys’ rooms so we could each enjoy our own space.</p>

<p>The smaller apartment’s bedroom/bathroom/kitchen was converted into our master suite, including a walk-in closet and bathroom. We essentially removed the kitchen and converted it to a nice-sized bathroom, which included keeping the window so that it now sits on the side of our roomy shower. (We had intended to add a powder room but unfortunately, the placement of pipes, some of which were not movable, made this impossible.)</p>

<p>What is now the TV room and den—a big favorite for watching sports or movies—sits astride with what was the wall separating the two apartments. We also made some modest renovations to the two bathrooms in the larger apartment including replacing the tile floors, adding in new sinks, enclosures, and toilets, one new medicine cabinet, and a fresh coat of paint. If we had a bigger budget, we might have done more.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apart-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41044 size-full" title="entryway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apart-04.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apart-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apart-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Mary-Wittenberg-Apart-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Aesthetically speaking, we lean heavily toward simplicity in design and function. The apartment already had traditional crown moldings and built-in bookcases, which are beautiful, but we used a mix of modern furniture and art for a look that combines both modern and traditional style. The dark floors we had in our original apartment were extended throughout the space—white oak stained in walnut with a satin polyurethane—contrasting the white walls for a clean, relaxing yet luxurious feel.</p>

<p>The Sweeten architect we chose was such a key partner in helping us bring our vision to completion, from helping us visualize the space to their thoughtful assistance in evaluating the contractors’ bids to helping solve problems, big and small, along the way.</p>

We learned that when we opened the walls and ceilings and found that a previous renovation by the unit above had cut pipe channels and damaged the structural beams between floors. The building inspector required that this be remediated, even though it wasn’t part of our unit, and that added a few months and an undesirable sidetrack to the original scope of our work. But after the demolition of the dividing wall, which looks out onto 78th Street&#8217;s picturesque row of brick townhouses, it literally took our breath away to see the open space and the sunlight spilling through the windows.</p>

<h3>Change in scenery</h3>
<p>Hudson Heights is a veritable small town in the big city. Chris and I moved to the neighborhood from the Upper West Side when we started our family. We stumbled across it after a bike ride up the west side bike path to the Cloisters, and it felt like no other neighborhood in the city—quiet, beautiful, on top of a hill overlooking the Hudson River, yet it still had everything that makes New York City such a special and diverse place to live. And the housing market offered more space for our money, so that was also appealing.</p>

<p>We bought a one-bedroom apartment, had three children, and found a home in this amazing neighborhood and community. Fast forward to nine years later, and Chris was offered a position in the California Bay Area. We were incredibly sad to leave Hudson Heights, but we had outgrown our one-bedroom apartment and knew a change was inevitable.</p>
<h3>Back to the beginning</h3>
<p>We spent two wonderful, adventure-filled years in California, but our old neighborhood, city, and home in New York City were always calling us back. When an opportunity came up for Chris to move to a team here, we knew it was meant to be. We immediately started looking for a home in Hudson Heights, and after many months of searching, the listing for this apartment appeared. It was the perfect space for our family. After so many years of uncertainty and bouncing around, we finally felt like we found a home to settle down in.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40958 size-full" title="open kitchen and dining space" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg" alt="open kitchen and dining space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment—a 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bath co-op in a post-war, 1950s building—was all in its original condition, except for a replaced refrigerator. Even the metal cabinets stuck together with paint and the linoleum kitchen floors were still intact. Thankfully, our budget allowed us to factor in a renovation, but we had never done anything like this before, not even in the old one-bedroom that we owned. Just thinking about being able to make a home specific to our taste and design was so exciting.</p>
<h3>Scoping out work for the renovation</h3>
<p>We wanted to update everything. Our hope was for a bright and airy home that looked modern and clean. I spent many late nights scouring <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/sweetenhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest</a>, so we knew what we liked and had an idea of ways to achieve that using certain colors, materials, and furniture, but we were still completely overwhelmed with choices of materials, where to get them, and how to stay within our budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40960 mb-0 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-04.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>A floor to match the aesthetic</h3>
<p>Our Sweeten design-build team guided us through all of that, suggesting brands, vendors, and materials to achieve our overall look. Thinking about our budget, I was definitely on the fence about where to spend and where to save, and I even waffled on whether we should get new floors. I thought the parquet floors held up well enough and still looked beautiful, but since we were going for a different modern look, we decided to redo the floors. I have to say, I am so glad we did because it completely changed the whole feel of the space.</p>

<h3>Letting the design-team lead</h3>
<p>Overall, our design-build team was awesome. When we met, they were professional, listened to and understood our vision, and also offered wonderful ideas we hadn’t thought of. It felt like their excitement for the project was mutual. And as we were first-time renovators, they were so great and helpful walking us through each step. They were constantly offering suggestions telling us what works and what doesn’t, always steering us in the right direction. <span style="color: #333333;">Our biggest question was, “Would you please hold our hand throughout this whole process because we do not know what the heck we are doing!”.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40962 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-06.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40966 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-10.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>Shifting the floor plan</h3>
<p>The kitchen needed the most improvement. In our previous homes, we always had wall-facing counters or a separate kitchen away from the living space, so entertaining was always a challenge or just had a difficult flow. With that in mind, we decided to partially open up the existing kitchen wall to create a two-sided counter with an area for stools on the other side where the kids or guests can sit.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40959 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-03.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula " width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>We also shifted the floor plan a little, pushing out the wall between the kitchen and the living room to widen the galley. We told our design-build team our vision, and they helped us figure out the best way to do that given the space and structure of the apartment.</p>
<h3>Versatility in the kitchen</h3>
<p>It is now so much easier when the kids want to help us in the kitchen. There is definitely a lot less pushing and arguing for space and for who gets to sit on a random chair we used to pull up to the counter. <span style="color: #333333;">Pancake mornings are more zen now that everyone has their own stool to sit on to help.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40968 size-full" title="kitchen sink" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-12.jpg" alt="kitchen sink" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40964 mb-0 size-full" title="desk niche" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08.jpg" alt="desk niche" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>I think if you asked Chris what he was the most excited about, it would be the built-in desk and cabinet space. We were able to work with our design-build team to create an organized drawer and cabinet system for our work and creative space, as well as a system for the constant flow of kids’ schoolwork, art supplies, and collections.</p>
<h3>A modern update</h3>
<p>In the dining room, we got a new light fixture for over the table, but we saved the original 1950s art deco chandelier that had hung over the original dining area and decided to shine it up and use it as a fixture in the girls&#8217; bedroom. They love it and it definitely makes for a fancy splash of fun in that room.</p>

<h3>A bathroom that fits just right</h3>
<p>For the bathroom, which is tiny, we had a barn door put on instead of having a door that opens into the bathroom, making the space even tighter.</p>

<h3>More room, more convenient</h3>
<p>Our design-build team also suggested the double doors for closets throughout the apartment in place of a single door. Our son plays the drums so having a wider entry opening was helpful. The double doors took up the least amount of space when opened and allowed for more wiggle room with our furniture. It made a world of difference.</p>

<h3>Plan for the &#8216;just-in-case&#8217;</h3>
<p>With any major project like this one, there will always be hiccups. Whether it be with the schedule, or with finding pipes in the wall you didn’t know were there, or with materials that you did not account for in the budget. Our advice to future renovators: Plan accordingly, but also maybe plan for &#8220;just-in-case.&#8221; Give yourself a buffer for scheduling and for budget, if you are able. It will most likely be needed.</p>
<p>We certainly needed it. We were renting elsewhere on a one-year lease, and when we bought the unit, we only had a few months left to go on our lease. So we were eager to get the ball rolling. The contractors gave us a clear schedule that aligned with the end of our lease, perfectly. There were some unforeseen hiccups around approvals and it could have taken much longer if it weren’t for our contractor and design team always going to bat for us and making necessary calls and contacting the powers that be to make sure things moved along at a faster pace.</p>

<h3>Working with remodeling hiccups</h3>
<p>Because of slow approvals, the schedule did get pushed back a few weeks. Our time renting had ended and we had to be out. But the project was still very much in the throes of construction, so we ended up staying at an extended-stay suite in the neighborhood directly across the bridge from us in New Jersey! We were carpooling back and forth over the George Washington Bridge for work and school—a traffic nightmare. Our contractor was very understanding and sympathetic to our needs, so he doubled his team and had everyone finishing up the place at top speed. And even if my kids did appreciate the free cookies at the hotel counter every day, we were thrilled to finally be in our finished apartment after a week in the hotel.</p>
<p>Looking back on it all, our newly renovated home makes us feel super grateful—grateful for having the ability to make the changes we wanted and grateful we found such a great team to help and make those changes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Simple streamlining makes good design even better</h2>
<p><em>Rebecca’s vision for the unique triplex apartment in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village started to form the first day she set foot in it. She was smitten with the multi-level layout and loved that the space had two full bathrooms. Rebecca, an Emmy-winning TV producer, bought the approximately 800<span style="color: #333333;">-square-foot,</span> one-bedroom co-op and moved in. Eight years went by before she was ready to renovate. It was time well spent. She’d used it to learn what she loved—and didn’t—about the upstairs, downstairs abode. Armed with a list of must-dos and ideas, Rebecca posted her project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects renovators with vetted general contractors. Soon, she had her Sweeten design-build firm signed on, ready to transform her home from super to superlative.</em></p>

<p>I loved the stacked layout of my apartment from the moment I saw it. The high ceilings made it feel like a loft—just the downtown Manhattan vibe I was looking for. Triplexes are rare; the three floors are a surprise when you walk in. I purchased the co-op eight years ago, knowing I would eventually renovate, but I wanted to live in it for a while, to think about the space and what I wanted to do with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40693 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-11.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-11-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40694 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-12.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Rebecca-Chatman-KitchenBath-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />I also wanted to take my time to find a contractor I really liked. This was my first experience with a renovation, and I had no idea how to approach it. Unfortunately, my first encounters with construction people left me feeling even more lost. I had spoken with a friend about my desire to change the apartment and told her about my frustration at trying to find the right contractor. She had a friend who’d had great success with Sweeten, and she suggested I check it out. After I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a>, I met with several bidding firms, but when I met the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor I ultimately hired</a>, I knew it was a match. We hit it off right away and she was genuinely excited to help me turn the apartment into a place I loved.</p>

The three-level layout wouldn’t make it easy, but the home did have good light, and the open staircases were a start. I wanted to free up the square footage on each floor while making every area more functional. My main focus was on the kitchen and bathrooms. The kitchen was small and closed-off and was in desperate need of a refresh. Both bathrooms were due to be gutted and redone. Like everyone else in New York City, I also wanted more (and smarter) storage. The contractor got it immediately.

She started by helping me come up with a color palette. I really like whites, grays, and cool blues, and I decided I wanted to carry those colors through the apartment so it felt like one cohesive space. Bright white has the amazing ability to modernize and brighten simultaneously, and we went with a lot of it, including on the walls, cabinetry, and shelving units to achieve a light, open look. I liked the contrast to the existing wood floors, which had been a honey-brown color, but looked so much better restained in a rich, dark walnut.</p>

The room was tiny and walled off from the rest of the apartment. It had a beat-up butcher-block counter and golden-brown, ‘80s-style cabinets. We decided to knock down the inside wall and open up the kitchen to the long, little-used entry hall adjacent to it. Later, when the contractor tore out the wall and the old kitchen behind it, the space immediately felt lighter and more spacious. It made a huge impact on the flow of the apartment.</p>
<p>I’ve always loved the complementary pairing of white and gray, so we chose a striking, slate-veined marble for the countertops and the facings on the newly created kitchen island. It coordinates beautifully with the stainless-steel appliances and cabinet hardware. The island offers plenty of room for a two-stool breakfast bar, and a sleek new storage unit lining the wall, with upper and lower cabinets, offers kitchen-goods storage and auxiliary counter space, too.</p>

<p>The kitchen was a total win, and that gave me the courage to take on the next phase: the renovation of both bathrooms. We did them one after the other, starting with the first-floor guest bath before moving upstairs to the master.</p>
<p>In each of the bathrooms, I hoped to find ways to create more space, while making the room feel brighter and more welcoming. Tile turned out to be the key. While shopping for it, I fell so in love with the stunning patterns I found at Ann Sacks that for both bathrooms, I selected the tile designs first—and fixtures and other elements to accommodate them. Once again, I went with whites and grays, doing the downstairs guest bath in marble, with a graphic black-and-white pattern on the floor.</p>

The construction team ripped out the old dove-gray tile and went to work on a sleek, simple design in black and white. Since this is my personal bathroom, I went with a glass shower panel in a stand-up shower. The small, wall-mounted vanity has a sleek matte black finish. To top off my storage desires and help the bathroom stay minimal, my Sweeten contractor set a giant, mirrored storage cabinet into the wall—this spot for bottles, jars, and brushes has a door that doubles as a full-length mirror.</p>

Even with one working bathroom at all times, it was really not fun! I kept telling myself that once the construction was finished, it would be amazing! And it really is. That dose of demo-inspired misery made my brand-new bathrooms look even shinier!</p>
<p>All told, the renovation lasted nine months. The kitchen and baths were the most work, but the job included paint and other aesthetic finishes in the living room and bedroom, and on both staircases as well. At every turn, I was in awe of, and so grateful for, my contractor’s knack for understanding how to make the most of small spaces. From the ingenious pull-out pantry next to the refrigerator she found for the kitchen to her suggestion of swapping out an iron inset on the second floor for a light-channeling glass panel, she helped me make the most of the space. My new-and-improved apartment is incredible. I’m so happy to come home every day!</p>

			<h2>California transplants undergo a bathroom renovation in a New York suburb</h2>

<h3>Bathroom in need of an upgrade</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alice’s work as a geneticist brought her husband Derek, their son Acelen, and the family’s miniature poodle, Royal, to Pleasantville, NY all the way from California. They purchased a single-family 3,300-square-foot home in the area and started planning for a bathroom renovation right away. The existing bathroom was definitely dated and as Alice put it, “The tub was so old, I didn’t want to set foot in it.” They wanted to renovate to create a fully enclosable wet-space to shower and then soak in the tub without stepping out of the room (which keeps the warm air from escaping). The plan was a similar arrangement to a bathroom renovation they completed in their California house.</span></p>

<h3>The right general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alice and Derek’s main concern was finding a general contractor. “We had a contracting team who was essentially a family-friend in Cali</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fornia, so finding the right contractor who we could trust in New York was one of the biggest hurdles for us to get started,” Alice shared. They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project to Sweeten</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, received matches, and ultimately </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">selected a Sweeten general contractor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to overhaul the bathroom.</span></p>

<h3>Changing the bathroom layout</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While sticking with the same overall square footage, the homeowners worked with their Sweeten general contractor to reconfigure the bathroom’s floor plan to include the desired wet-space. The bathtub was moved into the same room as the shower, and the toilet moved outside of the formerly enclosed room and directly across from the vanity. Their contractor recommended moving the main entry door, too. &#8220;I </span>didn&#8217;t know moving doors was so easy and it made the layout much easier to work with,&#8221; Alice said.</p>

<h3>Neutral and calm colors</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A soothing palette of creams and tans contributes to the spa-like feel, as well as modern fixtures for the tub and shower. The renovators chose </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/bathroom-trends-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wood-look tile flooring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that’s also waterproof and a vanity with natural wood doors for cohesion.  In the wet-room, a pebble-effect floor helps prevent slipping and creates a sense of separation between the spaces.</span></p>

<h3>Their vision a reality</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project went smoothly with the exception of one minor delivery delay with the bathtub. Work was stalled until it arrived and in retrospect, Alice says ordering materials ahead of demolition would’ve been a better idea.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our general contractor did a great job turning our vision into a reality,” Alice shared. “He </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">always listened to our ideas and worked with us to make them into operational tactics.” Now the family has a new bathroom retreat, and Alice loves soaking in the tub after a long day at work. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The toilet was outfitted with a bidet toilet seat, adding to the luxe vibe.</span></p>
