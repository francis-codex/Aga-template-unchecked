			<h2>The duo loves nothing more than making their clients&#8217; vision come to life!</h2>

<p><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: I’m from the country of Georgia and I’ve been in construction ever since Ilya started our business.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: I was born in Russia, grew up in Australia, and finally settled in New York City in my early 20s. I&#8217;ve been in the construction business professionally for 12 years. As a teenager, I used to work on construction sites almost every summer, and that is really where I developed a love of building.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get into this industry?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: When Ilya started our business 12 years ago, he always leaned on me for inspiration and advice. Ilya had a construction background, while mine was in marketing and advertising. He’s the expert contractor and I manage the back end of the business along with communications, marketing, and social media. If you see a smiley face in one of our emails, I probably wrote it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: I have always been interested in things that allowed me to be creative. Even as a kid, I was a Lego’s master! I went through culinary school in Australia, then jewelry school in New York City. I worked as a master jeweler, which is so similar to construction and building—only on a much smaller scale. Ultimately I decided to pursue my passion for construction and building.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love most about what you do?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: I’m a big people pleaser, and I love nothing more than knowing that our clients are truly happy with the home that we helped them design, build, and personalize.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: I love the process of being able to help take someone’s vision and turn it into a reality for them. When I see the look on their faces when they walk into their finished home, it makes the hard work all the worthwhile. No two projects are ever alike which always leaves plenty of room for renewed creativity!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35917 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-723x143.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-723x143.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-600x119.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit.jpg 975w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New York?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: Definitely all the red tape that comes with the management companies and co-op boards. I’m the lucky one that gets to deal with all of that!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya:</span> The biggest challenge—besides traffic and parking—is navigating all the different management companies, co-op boards, building codes, and permit regulations. These processes are a lot harder than they really need to be, but we always work hand-in-hand with everyone involved to ensure we have all the requirements going into the project so there are no delays along the way.</p>
<p><strong> What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: Renovating is expensive and not as simple as shown on television! There can and usually will be surprises along the way, so it’s always good to pad your budget by 10%, just in case.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: Pricing and budgets. So many folks don’t understand how expensive renovating in NYC can be! And while Pinterest can provide some amazing inspiration, their budgets oftentimes can’t support those ideas.  But that’s where our creativity kicks into full gear and we get to suggest amazing alternatives and more affordable options for consideration.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City building?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: The Chrysler Building—it’s gorgeous!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: My favorite modern building is the IAC building right across from Chelsea Piers, but my favorite classic NYC building is the Chrysler building.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City neighborhood?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: Brooklyn Heights, especially the boardwalk with the view of the Manhattan skyline. It takes my breath away every time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: Soho! It has the best mix of modern and classic architecture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These kitchen pantry designs prove that out-of-the-way organization can fit in apartments <em>and</em> single-family homes</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44167 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg" alt="kitchen, kitchen island, Brooklyn kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><strong>Storage, storage, storage.</strong> They say that in real estate that location is key. When it comes to kitchens, plenty of storage is essential. Kitchen pantries are easy and popular ways to increase the square footage of storage in your kitchen. Don&#8217;t worry—pantries don&#8217;t have to be massive (but they can be if you have the space for it!) With careful and creative design, smaller areas can serve as a place to put food items, serving accessories, dishes, and cleaning products.</p>
<p>Here, we share examples of different kitchen pantry designs from homeowners who <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked with a Sweeten contractor</a> to ensure they had ample storage in their homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Repurposing an entryway</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45625" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For these Montclair, New Jersey homeowners, updating the kitchen of their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new home</a> was a must. It felt small and claustrophobic, and only had eight feet of usable counter space. The configuration needed a lot of improvement. They worked with a Sweeten contractor to rework the layout.</p>
<p>The first thing they did was to remove an old butler&#8217;s pantry, which <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freed up space to add an island</a>. However, a pantry was still on their wish list, so they got rid of an unused cellar entrance and converted it into a walk-in pantry.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Pull-out drawers</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42272" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gina and Andrew</a> were uninspired by their dated kitchen that featured drab cabinets and an inconvenient layout. It was completely sectioned off from the living area and desperately needed a refresh. Working with their Sweeten contractor, the couple reimagined the layout to make it a functional and stylish kitchen. The cherry on top? The new floor-to-ceiling pantry with pull-out drawers. Pull-out drawers are always a plus since they help keep the space organized and provide easy-to-access item storage.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Floor-to-ceiling storage in a small apartment</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47056" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For Sweeten renovator Michele, it all started with a bathroom remodel, and the desire to replace her dishwasher. That turned into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/renovating-a-bathroom-kitchen-to-make-home-a-happier-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full gut reno of her kitchen</a>—but it was a change of plans that she was very happy with. Her Sweeten contractor recommended renovating to use the unused space near the entrance more efficiently. That got the ball rolling. The result is a large pantry, which fits in between the refrigerator and dishwasher. &#8220;Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment,&#8221; says Michele.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Wraparound pantry with copious storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44170" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-11a.gif" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadia and Stephen</a> were searching for a home that would fit their multigenerational family. They found it in their 2,300-square-foot home in Brooklyn, New York. The most striking design feature in their new home is the massive wraparound kitchen pantry. They added full-height cabinets since the area had a limit of 15-inch depths. This gave them plenty of storage space for serving ware, food items, and cleaning products.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Hidden door-style storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-Apt-11.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For their Park Slope two-bedroom co-op, Tara and Brian found a Sweeten contractor to help them <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rework their kitchen layout</a>. To lighten a hardworking wall that contained the stove, refrigerator, sink, and cabinetry, their contractor suggested relocating the refrigerator to an existing cluster of storage cabinets just outside the kitchen proper. The wall instantly felt lighter. Where the fridge once stood, the contractor cleverly made a small pantry, matching the &#8220;concealed&#8221; concept. When closed, the pantry looks like a tiled wall, but opens to reveal 10-inch deep shelves.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The kitchen&#8217;s helper</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26915 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen pantry" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nazli passed on upper cabinets so that she could mimic the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feeling of an open-plan apartment</a> on the first floor of her townhouse, establishing a clear line of vision from her front room all the way to the dining room. To make sure there was enough storage, the contractor created a walk-in pantry. Since the pantry is open to the rest of the kitchen, Nazli decided to paint it a darker color so that its contents wouldn&#8217;t be too distracting, allowing it to blend into its surroundings and almost disappear from sight.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></p>
<p>These kitchen pantry designs are just one aspect of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/entertaining-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">having a kitchen designed for stress-free cooking and entertaining</a>.</p>

			<h2 class="p1">Your dream basement renovation is possible. Here are the technical codes to tick off with your contractor.</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many benefits to upgrading a dark, damp basement to an inviting living space. Basement renovations can add significant square footage—and resale value—to a home. And it can be a blank slate; something to reimagine for any of your family&#8217;s needs, including entertaining, working from home, or relaxing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to your wish list, you&#8217;ll need to consider several technical and building code details, such as minimum ceiling heights, emergency egress regulations, insulation, and moisture control. These will influence your basement renovation&#8217;s timeline and cost.</p>
<p>We offer an overview of what would be involved. A vetted general contractor with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement remodeling experience</a> would provide a more in-depth discussion of what is possible in your space.</p>
<h3>Typical costs for a basement renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractors have worked on basement remodels starting at $20,000. This price point would update an already finished space and include painting, flooring, a new closet, and lighting. For a raw space that is being renovated to a finished living area, the average cost is $75,000. With this budget, you&#8217;ll likely be able to include a bathroom, a kitchen, and HVAC.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The existing condition of the space will always impact the budget. The floor may need to be dug deeper to increase ceiling height. The walls may require underpinning. New wiring and plumbing may need to be installed—guaranteed if you&#8217;re planning a whole new kitchen or bathroom. Insulation and waterproofing may be needed to control condensation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Happily, according to our contractors, there are no deal-breakers when it comes to basement renovations. Any problem—bad plumbing, lack of natural light, high humidity, a low ceiling—can all be sorted to create your dream basement. Ultimately, it will all depend on how much you are willing to spend. “It’s a balancing act to how much you want to put into the house before you exceed what value it brings,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alan, a Sweeten contractor</a>. &#8220;You also have to decide if cost value is important to you or is it more important to have a home you want to live in.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Square footage determines a basement renovation budget</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The amount of finished space you add to your basement will be a major factor in the renovation cost, as well as in the value it adds to your home. Sweeten general contractor Kyle says that his smallest basement renovation added just 400 square feet of living space, to be used as a kids&#8217; play area. More typical basement renovations are around 1,000 square feet, he said. And don’t forget: If the basement houses equipment, like a furnace or boiler, a mechanical room could take away a few hundred square feet from the livable space.</p>
<h3>Ceiling height requirements for basement renovations</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although building regulations vary from town to town, our contractors say the minimum height requirement for ceilings will be between six and seven feet. You may choose to add more height than this, for comfort and aesthetics. About 50% of basement jobs require the floor to be dug lower to allow for additional ceiling height. This process involves cracking open the existing concrete floor, removing the excess dirt, and re-laying the concrete.</p>
<h3>Creating a second form of egress</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you envision creating a living space for your basement, rather than a laundry and storage area? If so, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll need a second exit, also called an egress. &#8220;To be comfortable and have no problems with building inspectors, you will need that second form of egress, such as a window or a door with steps leading outside to ground level,&#8221; said Kyle, a Sweeten contractor. That usually means digging down to make an open passageway on one side of the building so there is a way to get in and out.</p>
<h3>Basement renovations that add plumbing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Often, homeowners will add a half or a full bath to their new basement space. The plumbing for this usually goes under the concrete flooring. This will help avoid flooding if any of the pipes burst. Since your basement living space will probably be below sewer lines, you&#8217;ll need a pump to get waste out, said Kyle. Of course, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding a bathroom</a> will also add to the budget, but for many, the convenience is worth it, he said.</p>
<h3>Waterproofing and insulation protection</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basements account for the majority of your home&#8217;s indoor moisture, according to Alan. On top of the general humidity in your basement, flooding may be a periodic problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The answer to moisture problems is often insulation and waterproofing. There are intelligent products that can help. If a conversion involves a bedroom, it is especially important to control moisture, to prevent toxic from forming. In-wall products like <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/building-insulation/products/membrain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CertainTeed’s MemBrain</a> is an accessory to regular insulation that allows the buildup of moisture to escape while preventing moisture from entering in the first place. Its 2-step installation process will add a few extra days to a basement renovation timeline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even with intelligent products, insulation requires multiple products and systems to stay on top of heat, cold, and humidity, according to Ted Winslow, a representative from CertainTeed. This could mean using spray foam to fill in cracks and seal windows and doors, along with other insulation products.</p>
<h3>Improving basement ventilation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To prevent toxic mold, the humidity of living spaces should be kept below 60 percent, according to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/mold/mold-course-chapter-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Environmental Protection Agency</a>. Achieving this often requires ventilation, in addition to waterproofing and insulation. Relying on natural airflow from windows is possible, but its subject to the weather and seasons. Extending your home&#8217;s existing HVAC system will also help ventilate the basement area. However, many basements will require the direct removal of humidity. Kareem suggests installing exhaust fans into the wall or window. These push damp air out while circulating the remaining air around the entire house. This system can either turn on when the lights are switched on, or be equipped with sensors that switch the fans on once humidity gets above a certain level. A dehumidifier is another option, but be prepared to pump that wastewater up to the sewer lines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">—</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640065166222"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to save money on a basement remodel?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">The amount of finished space you add to your basement will be a major factor in costs. Additionally, adding a kitchen or bathroom to a basement will increase costs considerably, so keep your remodel simple–painting, flooring, a new closet, and lighting. However, don’t skimp on humidity-controlling features: basements are prone to wetness, causing toxic mold. Be sure to install a good HVAC system, exhaust fans, or a dehumidifier.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640065183452"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to make a basement into a living space</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">First, make sure the ceiling height is adequate–at least 6-7 feet. You’ll also need a second form of egress, which is an exit from the lower level to the outside. This could be a window or a door with steps leading outside to ground level. To create an egress, you’ll need to dig down to make an open passageway on one side of the building to create the way in and out. Basements are prone to humidity, which can cause mold; so install a new HVAC system and exhaust fans.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640065198167"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to add a bathroom to a basement</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">To add a bathroom to a basement, you’ll need new wiring and plumbing, which usually goes under the concrete flooring. Although it can be costly, a benefit to adding plumbing beneath the flooring is that you’ll avoid flooding if any of the pipes burst. Additionally, you may also need insulation and waterproofing to control condensation, which can cause mold growth in basements. Since most basements are below sewer lines, you’ll need a pump to get waste out.</p>

It can add a point of interest that elevates the design and makes it stand out. But a “pop of color” doesn’t mean the color has to be overly bold. It can be a nicely balanced rich hue that helps define the look of the space. Here, we share examples of Sweeten renovators who added color to kitchens and turned up the overall design of their homes.</p>

</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The use of the color blue has seen an uptick in use in the last few years. As seen in these Sweeten renovations, the shade, placement, and amount of blue may vary, but each project uses the hue to its fullest potential. <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Walter&#8217;s renovation</a> of their Park Slope apartment included a kitchen and bath remodel but it&#8217;s the kitchen where they made the most dramatic choice. They used Lucerne from Benjamin Moore to give style to their entire kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Conversely, Sweeten renovator <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/chef-remodels-belltell-loft-kitchen-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnish</a> wanted his kitchen to be <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more neutral for resale purposes</a> but still wanted to add some personality. He did so by putting in white upper and base cabinets but using blue (almost black) cabinets in the peninsula.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These Sweeten homeowners wanted a &#8220;classic [kitchen] with flair.&#8221; To achieve this, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-stamp-of-approval-for-a-westchester-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracey and Brian</a> incorporated blue when redoing their kitchen—a project that they had dreamed about since they moved into their Pelham Manor home 14 years ago. Blue is Tracey&#8217;s favorite color, so like Laura and Walter, they found a color from Benjamin Moore they liked. However, they were pleasantly surprised when they realized Omega had cabinets in almost that exact shade, eliminating the need for a custom paint color.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A long-distance relationship would soon culminate into living together in a 1915 co-op for <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-studio-co-op-renovated-for-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim and Ian</a>. With Kim in New Jersey and Ian in Australia, they were relieved that shopping for materials could be done online, including the sky blue herringbone backsplash tile.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Going green in the kitchen</h3>

</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These Sweeten renovators <a href="https://www.bhg.com/kitchen/cabinets/styles/green-cabinet-colors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decided to give green a go</a>. When Keren Richter&#8217;s client hired her to design the <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-williamsburg-studio-goes-boutique-hotel-chic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a> in his Brooklyn home, she was happy he was game to think of the box. &#8220;Repainting the gray kitchen cabinetry in a vivid green was a biggie,&#8221; recalled Keren. “The color is a total showstopper, and we are so glad he was game!” Likewise but in a softer hue, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-patio-house-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Tim</a> updated their Queens townhouse kitchen in green. The mint green shaker-front cabinets &#8220;match the feel of the old house but are also clean and modern at the same time.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For their kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gina and Andrew</a> were inspired by their co-op&#8217;s verdant backyard. They wanted to bring the outside in, so they chose a beautiful shade of agave for the lower cabinets. Similarly, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maggie and Adam</a> chose a light green  for their lower cabinets in order to &#8220;add the layer of color that fit their style.”</p>

<h3>A passion for a purple kitchen</h3>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-kitchen-fit-for-the-lights-on-broadway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marissa</a> used Sweeten when remodeling her bathroom a few years ago. So, when she and her husband, Jeremy, were ready to redo their kitchen, they turned to the renovation matchmaker once again. Their Sweeten contractor was able to help them envision the flow and look of the space. To keep the space from feeling washed out with all white cabinets, they added a deep purple on the nearby walls. The result is a stylish yet classic design that will stand the test of time.</p>

<h3>Not-so-mellow yellow cook space</h3>

The cabinets had seen a lot of wear and tear, and appliances and drawers were not in the best positions. They wanted a kitchen that they could entertain in. They worked with a Sweeten contractor to reconfigure the layout and then turned their sights on the design details. The centerpiece of the entire kitchen is the yellow Moroccan tile backsplash. “It makes us happy every day,” she said. Another delight: the organic feeling of the small details that blend seamlessly into the rest of their home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What can homeowners do when they need more space at home—but don&#8217;t want to leave?</h2>
<p>Many homeowners find themselves in a tough spot when their home&#8217;s space, design, or location stops working for them. Many wind up asking themselves: should I move, or remodel?  A <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/americans-prefer-renovations-21576/">Zillow study</a> found that when given a choice between spending a fixed budget on a down payment or using the same amount to remodel, 76 percent would opt to renovate.</p>
<p>Between leaving their neighborhoods and staying put, these homeowners ultimately made the choice to reimagine their homes with Sweeten&#8217;s help. <span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>A big refresh for a beloved loft</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leah and Brian loved the Logan Square <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loft they had been calling home</a> for several years. The Chicago neighborhood’s energy and the industrial brick warehouse added to the lifestyle they were enjoying. But with time the wear-and-tear takes a toll on materials and daily functioning. They decided to renovate and stay in the area. The couple posted their project on Sweeten to update the entire space including a new kitchen and floors. Without structural changes, Leah and Brian brought out the best of their 14-foot ceilings.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="white-island-separator-blue-cabinets"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48144 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After.jpg" alt="white island separator in a kitchen with blue cabinets and white countertop space along with blue wallpaper and open white shelves" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>When you can&#8217;t go bigger, get creative</h3>
<p>Surging prices in her Fort Greene co-op building made upgrading from a studio to a true one-bedroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">out of the question for Mollie</a>. She had to decide to either move elsewhere to get more space or remodel her cozy studio. Luckily, Mollie realized the market value of her apartment (and that she could borrow against her equity)! She came to Sweeten, was matched with a general contractor, and reconfigured the 500-square-foot apartment to suit her playful style.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="light-brick-wall-narrow-living-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48148 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4.jpg" alt="light brick wall in a narrow living room with plush gray and blue furniture and open metal shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Baby on the way? Make your square footage go further</h3>
<p>A two-bedroom apartment was perfect for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-duplex-renovated-for-a-new-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel and Marco</a>—until they decided to expand their family. Fortunately, their duplex had enough square footage for them to get creative with! This made it possible to remodel and rethink how they used the layout, instead of moving. They turned the top floor into a combined kitchen and living area, while they divided the rest of the space into an office, closet, and bedrooms.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-gray-cabinets"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48147 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg" alt="white kitchen with gray kitchen cabinets under white countertop and farmhouse style sink after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Give a well-loved home some TLC upgrades</h3>
<p>After a year-long search for a new apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/renovating-to-stay-in-a-beloved-neighborhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Igor</a> decided their sons’ schools, proximity to work, and an overall adoration for their lifestyle in Carroll Gardens were reason enough to stay in their apartment. They worked with a Sweeten general contractor to overhaul their dark kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom. The result? Open and modern spaces fit for the family of four.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-barn-door-large-living-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48146 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg" alt="white barn door in a large living room with large windows and natural wood flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Combine two apartments into one home, sweet home</h3>
<p>A desire for more room led to multiple (unsuccessful) apartment searches for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoe and Arvid</a>. Her dream of renovating and combining apartments finally put the hunt to an end. After contacting neighbors and finding one who was looking to move, their plan was underway. The additional square footage allowed for a third bedroom, a much larger kitchen, and an expanded living area.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="large-gray-living-room-vinyl-floor"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48145 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg" alt="large gray and white living room with large windows and brown vinyl floor after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting &#8220;upstate&#8221; light and space—with a city zip code</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney and Jim’s</a> Clinton Hill Co-op apartment lacked storage and light, which sent them on a search for a second home upstate. When they made an offer on the second property, reality hit: they needed to make their main residence work for them before taking on a new place. The couple decided to remodel, opening up the kitchen the rest of the living areas and reconfiguring storage closets to suit the family of four’s storage needs.</p>

<h3>Entire Homes</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40095 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="house exterior" width="1000" height="847" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01-300x254.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01-600x508.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether an apartment, brownstone, or standalone house, Sweeten contractors can take any space and make it uniquely your own. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/tudor-style-house-renovation-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra and Nelson</a> wanted to update their Brooklyn home to fit their new needs. Their kids were grown, so they wanted to focus on the house. They wanted a more convenient living space. With the help of their contractor, they remodeled the kitchen, dining, and living room. Plus, they turned a small office into a beautiful sunroom.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten also transforms apartments for open-concept living or more personal space with walls or partitions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/home-remodeling-tips-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitzie and Jenifer</a> (<em>below</em>). created a seamless flow from one living space to another.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41442" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-15.jpg" alt="living room and kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-15-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Kitchens &amp; Baths</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37769" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12.jpg" alt="New Jersey, Jersey City, renovation, two family, remodel, one family, kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchens and baths are the sweet spots for our contractors. No matter the square footage, each space comes with its own unique set of requirements. Bathrooms and kitchens can be rip-and-replace projects, where the floor plan is not altered or they can be of a larger scope. These types of projects can entail reworking/upgrading electrical and plumbing like was necessary for two smaller <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baths combined as one</a> (<em>below</em>) or Carol and Jon&#8217;s<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-one-family-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweeten kitchen renovation</a> (<em>above</em>).  For these changes, an experienced contractor will call in the right pros to help.</span></p>

<p>Commonly known as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADUs</a> (accessory dwelling units), these converted spaces have become more and more popular. They are a great way to add valuable square footage to your home and create additional, functional spaces.

<p>When you have a big project, such as updating the exterior of your home or putting on an addition, having the right renovation team is key. <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-home-addition-plan-allows-a-family-of-5-to-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alicia&#8217;s</a> Sweeten contractor added 1,000 square feet to the back of her house (<em>above</em>).

<p>Sometimes a room needs a small decorative touch such as trim and millwork. Built-ins are an investment that offers a finished look and functional storage as in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Walter&#8217;s den</a> (<em>above</em>). Trim and molding also set a polished look for every room. A &#8217;60s house receives elegant millwork in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-traditional-house-remodel-offers-a-dose-of-modern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovation below.</a></p>

<p>The Hamptons…the mere mention conjures up images of poolside luxury and endless summer. But what’s it really like to live—and renovate—there? If you’re considering buying a home in the East End to renovate, there are some things you should know. Luckily for you, we’ve done the homework! Read on to learn what to expect (and budget) for your Hamptons renovation costs. (Keep in mind that all projects are unique, and many variables will impact a remodel!)</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> offers a guide to Hamptons renovation costs, focusing on four categories—cost per square foot, kitchen, bathroom, and permits. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p>Note: every expert contractor will want to have a detailed chat and inspection of your home before creating an estimate for your needs and wants.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of typical Hamptons renovation costs, compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling’s</em> 2023 <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full home renovation: Starting at <strong>$100 per square foot (psf)</strong> with stock materials; high-end properties start at <strong>$250+ psf</strong></li>
<li>Budget kitchen remodel: <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: <strong>$40,000—$75,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end kitchen remodel: <strong>$75,000+</strong></li>
<li>Budget bath remodel: <strong>$20,000</strong></li>
<li>Mid-grade bath remodel:<strong> $25,000—$40,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end bath remodel: <strong>$40,000—$100,000</strong></li>
<li>Basement remodel: <strong>$25,000—$100,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear: when referring to the Hamptons, we are talking about the <a href="https://www.southamptontownny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Town of Southampton</a> and the <a href="https://ehamptonny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Town of East Hampton</a>, which both comprise many hamlets and villages. Hamlets such as Westhampton, East Quogue, or Hampton Bays lie within the boundaries of the town of Southampton. The villages of Amagansett and East Hampton are within the administrative boundaries of the town of East Hampton. So, any building permits filed will be with the offices of Southampton or East Hampton.</p>
<p>There is a season for everything, but especially in the Hamptons. <span class="s1">Usually, there is a big push before summer so that everyone can enjoy their homes before the summer is out, and everyone is very busy. If possible, start your design process in the fall and do the work in the winter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-48218 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="40" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1-300x20.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>

<h3><br><br>Hamptons home renovation costs per square foot</h3>
<p>According to experts who work in both New York City and the Hamptons, the consensus is that costs per square foot are essentially the same in both locales. As we point out in our cost guide to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-square-foot-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester County</a>, proximity to Manhattan dictates both the buyer demographic as well as real estate values. This, in turn, is reflected in the cost of renovations. As Sweeten contractor Eric points out, however, there are subtle differences between the villages and hamlets, with East Hampton being the priciest. Sweeten sees projects starting at <strong>$100 per square foot</strong> with stock materials and high-end properties at <strong>$250+ psf</strong>.</p>
<p>While renovation costs per square foot will vary depending on whether it is a gut or non-gut, and the level of finishes and custom features you require, Eric tells us that there is a starting point of <strong>$150 psf</strong> for renovations with stock materials. Luxury waterfront properties, however, start at <strong>$500 psf</strong> for high-end renovations and can exceed <strong>$1,000</strong> depending on complexity and finishes. (See <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Budget Basics: Renovation Costs Per Square Foot</a>, where we outline three levels of renovation.)</p>
<p>Additionally, cost increases over the past year have also pushed baseline budgets upwards: the price of fuel has gone up, as has general liability insurance, said Sweeten contractor Eric. “Building materials are also up from last year because of supply and demand; everyone is renovating! And when homeowners are renovating, the cost for electricians and plumbers and other subs increase, because they can pick and choose between the most profitable jobs. They will charge more now for smaller jobs like a single kitchen or bath.”</p>

Square footage, scope of work, and estimated amount of time it will take to complete the job are all major considerations that go into pricing out the project.”</li>
<li>High-end kitchen:&nbsp;At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen projects cost start at <strong>$75,000</strong> for high-end finishes. According to <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</a><span class="s2">, a major high-end kitchen remodel averages $178,347 in New York.&nbsp;</span><br>This is based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with top-of-the-line custom cabinets, stone countertops, imported tile backsplash, built-in refrigerator, microwave, commercial-grade cooktop, and vent hood, as well as all new lighting and wood floors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sweeten contractor John estimates that a high-end kitchen in the Hamptons will start at <strong>$150,000</strong> and up.</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-national-edition/">Costs for a bathroom renovation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Budget bathroom remodel: At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen projects begin at <strong>$20,000</strong>. John quotes a three-piece (shower, sink, and toilet) project to average out to about <strong>$35,000&nbsp;</strong>for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Sweeten has completed bathroom renovations between <strong>$25,000—$40,000</strong> in the mid-range that covers about 100 square feet. </span></span><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/?bwts=1692367227">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</a><span class="s2"> cites an average of <strong>$29,915</strong> for a mid-grade bath remodel.</span></li>
<li>High-end bathroom remodel: At the high-end range, Sweeten renovations that consist of three-pieces can cost between <strong>$40,000—$60,000</strong>. A high-end master suite remodel consisting of 4-5 pieces including a shower, double sink, bathtub, and toilet costs between <strong>$60,000—$100,000</strong>.

</ul>
<p>Sweeten contractor John estimates that a high-end master bath renovation would run about <strong>$100,000</strong> on average.</p>
<h3>Costs for a basement renovation</h3>
<p>At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/sweeten-renovations/basement-renovations/">basement remodels</a> budgeted at <strong>$100—$150 psf</strong> or <strong>$25,000</strong> for a simple coat of paint. A gut renovation would cost <strong>$50,000—$100,000</strong> which could include plumbing, electrical, an entertainment center, appliances, closets, and with possible walls going up or down.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What to know about permits in the Hamptons</h3>
<p>Permits are a big part of the renovation process in Hamptons towns. While expediters are not regularly used there, the process can involve two types of <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">experts not usually called upon in renovation projects</a> elsewhere.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental consultants</strong> can assist homeowners and architects in parsing land use regulations, coastal environmental planning, and acquisition of related permits. Given the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/">delicate ecosystems</a> and the proliferation of wetlands and sand dunes along the coasts, these consultants are crucial to navigating this aspect of the permit process. Additionally, they can answer help determine whether you can expand the footprint of a house or add a dock. They typically charge by the hour (ranging from <strong>$250-350/hour</strong>, with a minimum project fee). For the initial site inspection and report, some offer a flat rate fee of around <strong>$1,500. </strong>This fee would cover the property inspection and produce a report.</li>
<li><strong>Local attorneys</strong> who are well-versed in the zoning codes of the particular town in question can help navigate the process. Sweeten architect Andrew tells us that East Hampton recently changed some of its codes and a local attorney assisted him and his client in liaising with the town office on a debated matter of allowable square footage. Attorneys’ fees vary; a local real estate agent can provide recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keeping up with local regulations and requirements</h3>
<p>While the town offices may be small and provide a more personal interaction, as Sweeten architect Andrew relates, don’t mistake that casual air for a casual approach to enforcing regulations. For example, certain Hamptons neighborhoods won’t allow work on weekends, or after a certain time during high season. There have also been increasing attempts to limit the square footage on properties and accessory structures that may be used as rental properties. Additionally, there are stringent regulations at the town, state, and federal levels that will affect your renovation, depending on scope.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s important to understand what the current code is. However, you should also try to find out what is upcoming or anticipated in terms of changes. Because project timelines can extend, you want to ensure you&#8217;re complying with the relevant codes when your project finishes.</span></p>
<p>One relatively recent development has been<a href="https://ehamptonny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/2224/Adopt-Local-Law-Amending-Chapter-102-to-Adopt-HERS-Rating-Energy-Conservation-Requirements-PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a change in the energy conservation requirements</a> in East Hampton, for example. Andrew notes that he is dealing with this on a current project. Now, they&#8217;ll need to hire someone who is certified to complete the HERS rating, which will cost between <strong>$1,000—$2,000</strong>. They may also need to use different building components to achieve better insulation and R-value required today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An outdoor kitchen is the ultimate al fresco space! Get ready for a ton of fun (and a good investment for your home)</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Deck-1000-res.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="outdoor-swimming-pool-brown-deck" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Deck-1000-res-723x480.jpg" class="mb-10" alt="outdoor swimming pool and brown deck area with furniture after renovation" width="723" height="480" /></a><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Outdoor kitchen renovation by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Dennis</a></span></p>
<p>If you agree that the kitchen is the heart of the home, then consider bringing that sense of entertaining and relaxation outside with an outdoor kitchen. The options for an outdoor kitchen are endless—sinks, fridges, lighting, roofing, the list goes on.</p>
<p>If this sounds appealing, then you are not alone! More than 70 percent of homeowners who have outdoor space are looking to enhance the patio with the goal of making it more relaxing, according to a recent survey from American Home Furnishing Alliance. A CNN Money survey predicted the outdoor kitchen market to be worth almost $6 billion yearly.</p>
<p>An outdoor kitchen might become the cherry on top of your home renovation plans. It isn’t the cheapest project, nor a necessity, but <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines what you need to know to help you weigh your decision. Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</p>
<h3>How to schedule your outdoor kitchen project</h3>
<p>Luckily, it&#8217;s possible to do outdoor work at nearly any time of the year. However, weather with temperatures above freezing (minus rain and snow!) is preferred. On average, the shortest timeframe to complete an outdoor kitchen without delays or unforeseen events is 2-3 weeks. The longest average timeframe for an outdoor kitchen completion is four months. Start the process at least six months before you want to have the outdoor kitchen completed which also leaves enough time to create a good kitchen plan, advises Dennis, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten general contractor</a> in Philadelphia.</p>
<h3>How much does an outdoor kitchen cost?</h3>
<p>Like all home renovation projects, it’s best to determine what you want to spend in the beginning. Your budget will be a meeting place of your financial abilities and what you need and want. Dennis has worked on outdoor kitchens in the Philadelphia area that range in price from $15,000 to more than $100,000, which is a similar price range given by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6576#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jose, a Sweeten general contractor</a> in the Miami area.</p>
<p>A lower-budget outdoor kitchen will use materials such as concrete or cement pavers for the floor, according to New York City <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Santi</a>. Pressure-treated wood for cabinetry is also another good value choice. Materials in a more expensive outdoor kitchen could be stainless steel cabinets, stone floors, and a natural stone countertop, Santi said.</p>
<p>Appliances will also take up a big chunk of the budget. Jose said you should expect to pay several thousand dollars for a grill, fridge, and other appliances that are tough enough to survive the great outdoors.</p>
<p>The national average cost of a mid-range backyard patio that includes a fire pit, small fridge, sink, gas grill, lighting, a pergola, and a 20-foot square patio on flat ground is about $56,000, according to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs Value</a> report. That renovation will add over $30,000 to your home’s value. Many outdoor kitchens will start with a patio or deck that is already there, potentially bringing down the cost, according to Dennis.</p>
<h3>Design ideas for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>The layout of your outdoor kitchen can be drawn up by a kitchen designer or in a growing number of cases, a landscaper, says Dennis. Landscapers help to blend the outdoor kitchen into the overall look of your outdoor space. And of course, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your general contractor can likely assist</a> you with the design.</p>
<p>Consider where you place the grill, sink, and fridge as they create the “work triangle” for whoever is cooking. Be sure to keep that area free of obstructions or foot traffic. The design is also an important time to look at the strength of your deck if you are not starting from scratch. Dennis advises that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">existing decks will need to be assessed</a> to determine if they can handle the added weight.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="stone-counter-granite-countertop" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45766 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg" alt="stone counter and granite countertop for outdoor kitchen after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Outdoor kitchen renovation by New York <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4277#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor John</a></span></p>
<h3>Materials used in outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>With the outdoor factor, the materials used will differ greatly from your indoor kitchen. And then factor in your style preference and budget. If a bench—a single permanent structure that encompasses countertop, storage, and appliances—is part of your design, common materials are stucco, concrete, or stacked stone, says Dennis. Quartz is also a possibility, according to Jose.</p>
<p>When it comes to cabinets, don’t install too many as you’re not going to keep a lot of plates, pots, and pans in your outdoor kitchen. Whatever you do have should be able to stand up to the winter cold and that includes pipes that drain easily for winterizing.</p>
<h3>Common outdoor kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>The staple piece of your outdoor kitchen, and likely the most expensive, is the grill. If you’re planning on installing this permanently by building it into a bench, then don’t hold back on price, Dennis advised. “You want to make sure you have a quality grill—and fridge—because if they break you aren’t going to find one that is an exact fit for the permanent structure,” he said.</p>
<p>Whether your chosen grill will use a propane tank or rely on gas lines, it will have a big impact on your budget, timelines, and permits needed. Even though you&#8217;ll need to replace a tank, you won&#8217;t need gas lines from house to patio; which saves time, money, and effort.</p>
<p>Ironically, not all fridges can withstand the winter. “Some fridges cannot handle freezing weather even though that seems odd,” Dennis said. Outdoor fridges must work harder to maintain a constant temperature when the weather fluctuates. Consider high-grade stainless steel, which will reduce rust.  But don’t forget the added convenience of an outdoor fridge comes with the inconvenience of needing electricity. This will set you back a few hundred dollars, but solar energy is a possibility.</p>
<h3>Coverings for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Providing shade and shelter from the rain comes in many forms. For more extravagant outside kitchens—such as a TV for watching sports and a sound system—Dennis recommends something similar to a gazebo roof that has full coverage. There’s also lattice, which will provide some shade, but not rain cover. On the lower end of the budget scale is a retractable awning.</p>
<h3>Lighting for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Have a long think about what you will use your new outdoor space for. Will you be reading? Playing cards with friends at night? Then perhaps you need more lighting over the seating area as well as where you prepare the food.</p>
<p>Hosting dinner parties? Then consider more ambient lighting that highlights architecture. And if you’re already planning on having a fridge and the electricity it needs, the lighting might be a natural progression.</p>
<h3>Plumbing for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>Running water is important for cooking, so prepare to lay some pipes from your house to your outdoor kitchen. Depending upon the distance, it could cost between $600 to $1,500, according to Sweeten contractor Jose. Cold water is the only necessity here, but “if a client really wants hot water, we can explore a really small, tankless water heater,” he said.</p>
<p>Once you get the water out there, you then have to get rid of it. “You can’t put the waste water into the ground,” said Jose, “It needs to be connected back into the house’s sewer.” Use of a <a href="https://homesteady.com/info-12182622-can-use-dry-well-outdoor-sink.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dry well,</a> where water is filtered before going into the ground, might be possible, but this will depend on building codes.</p>
<h3>Tip: Prepare for permits</h3>
<p>The permitting process for outdoor kitchens can be surprisingly complicated. Not only will you need a building permit, but also an electrical permit for refrigeration. If you don’t want to use gas tank lighting, you’ll need mechanical or plumbing permits for water and gas. To avoid gas or electricity permits, clients can use a gas cylinder for the grill and solar energy for electricity, Sweeten contractor Santi suggested.</p>
<p>You may need approval from a zoning department. Dennis advises homeowners to check their local zoning codes as there may be limits on how much land you can cover with materials like concrete because rain cannot easily soak through it. There may also be restrictions on how close to the property line you can build. “It would be a waste of time to design something gorgeous and then submit it and not have it approved,” Dennis said.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moving into a new house—or realizing an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/remodeling-old-house-vintage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">older home hasn’t kept up</a> with your lifestyle—can make renovation feel like a path to reinvention. However, creating a budget for a remodel is unique to every project! Budgets depend on many factors, like the materials you choose, changes in layout, or moving plumbing or gas lines.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have compiled a guide to renovation costs across Westchester County, New York, focusing on four categories: kitchen, bathroom, basement, and permits.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a breakdown of typical starting costs compiled from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> renovations and <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Westchester home remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s no secret that Westchester County, with its close proximity to New York City, is one of the pricier areas when it comes to real estate. That is also reflected in the cost of renovations. <span style="color: #333333;">On average, many Sweeten projects can range from <strong>$100 </strong></span><strong>psf<span style="color: #333333;">—$250 </span>psf</strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333333;">. Based in Westchester, </span></span></span><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4186" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Gregory</span></a> has worked on projects that involve multiple rooms or a gut renovation at the <strong>$250 psf range. </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anything higher, he said, “usually applies to one or more specialty trades, such as architects or engineers, and insurance costs which factors into the overall budget.” Choice of material will also affect the cost per square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Similarly, a higher cost stems from the quality and experience of the skilled workers the contractors hire for the project. “Costs for construction vary based on experience, which increases for a higher-end result,” said a <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor,</span> who handles projects in the Westchester area. For instance, “A presentation representing the finished product—design and organizing, scheduling, and advising on the materials—is a service that adds to the budget.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing to note: While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. Therefore, the prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much a Westchester kitchen renovation costs</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="s2">Budget kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at </span><span class="s3"><b>$25,000—$30,000</b></span><span class="s2"> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.</span></li>
<li><span class="s2">Mid-grade kitchen: Expect to see starting budgets from </span><span class="s3"><strong>$40,000</strong>—<strong>$50,000</strong></span><span class="s2"> for a typical mid-grade kitchen.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s2">Westchester-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a> has worked on projects costing <b>$40,000</b> for 150 square feet, or about<b> $260 psf</b>. This budget includes mid-grade finishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s2"><i>Remodeling</i>’s<a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span class="s5">Cost vs. Value report</span></a> puts <b>$350 psf</b> or <b>$70,000</b> total, as an average for Westchester County. These figures are based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with standard finishes, like an energy-efficient range, built-in microwave, and ventilation system. It also includes garbage disposal, custom lighting, and resilient floorings such as vinyl, linoleum, or cork.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">High-end kitchen: Sweeten has seen projects start at <strong>$70,000</strong> for a high-end kitchen.<span class="s2"><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><span class="s6">In the Cost vs. Value report, the average high-end kitchen remodel cost <b>more than $137,000</b> for a 200-square foot space. </span><span class="s7">A project in that price range includes custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported tile backsplashes. The appliances can include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood as well as high-end faucets and a water filtration system.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">According to Sweeten contractor Majid, a large part of a high-end kitchen can be attributed to the cabinets. For example, one of Majid&#8217;s clients recently spent <b>$50,000</b> on fully custom European cabinets.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much a Westchester bathroom renovation costs</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="s2">Budget bathroom: A budget bathroom renovation, including demo, plumbing work, and new finishes, can reach </span><span class="s3"><b>$16,000</b></span><span class="s2">, said Oziel. Bathrooms in this category typically lean on big-box stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot to source the majority of materials.<br /></span></li>
<li><span class="s2">Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom in Westchester County will cost on average </span><span class="s3"><b>$22,000</b>,</span><span class="s2"> according to the Cost vs. Value report, which is <b>$628 psf</b> for a 35-square-foot bathroom. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain-on-steel tub.<br /></span></li>
<li><span class="s2">High-end bathroom: Prices can start at around <strong>$32,000</strong> for a standard full bath with high-end finishes. However, homeowners are more likely to splurge for high-end in their master baths, bringing the starting cost for a typical high-end bathroom to around <strong>$46,000.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With a higher budget, clients are looking at faucets that can cost $2,000 apiece, marble flooring, custom vanities, built-in medicine cabinets, a rain shower, and top-of-the-line lighting fixtures. At times, those pricey finishing materials can amount to half the budget. Whether it is budget or high-end, good general contractors can strategize with a reasonable budget to help clients achieve renovation goals.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for a basement renovation in Westchester</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractors have worked on basement renovations that cost anywhere from <b>$20,000 to $75,000. </b>A<b> $20,000—$30,000 </b>or <b>$50/psf </b>budget would update an already finished basement. This includes painting, flooring, and lighting. If the space is raw and being <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovated to a finished living area</a>, the cost is around <b>$75,000</b>. For this budget, a bathroom, a kitchen, and HVAC can be added.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Majid, a simple basement remodel can cost as little as <b>$50 a square foot</b>, which works out to be about <b>$40,000</b> for an 800-square-foot space. Adding a toilet or shower could increase your budget, plus any necessary work to bring the room up to code. Waterproofing and drainage can also push up a basement project’s cost. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some town regulations might require two forms of egress or natural light (by adding a door or a window) or a certain ceiling height, which means digging down and lowering the floor. An average basement conversion in Westchester is <b>$75,000</b>, according to the Cost vs. Value report. A project with this budget includes a 20×30 foot room, a 5&#8217;×8&#8242; bathroom with a shower and bar area, plus insulation and laminate flooring. This example project works out to<b> $117 psf</b>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for permits in Westchester</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cost of permits changes from town to town in Westchester County. Typically, home renovation costs will be determined by your budget, and require some basic math to figure out. For example, the permit costs below are broken out among the different towns across the County:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Pelham</span></span><span class="s1">: Building permits cost <b>$250</b> for a project costing under <b>$5,000</b> plus <b>$12</b> per each additional <b>$1,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Scarsdale</span></span><span class="s1">: Building permits cost<b> $255</b> for a project costing between <b>$10,000</b> and <b>$50,000</b>. For projects budgeted over <b>$100,000</b>, a permit costs a flat fee of <b>$1,755</b> plus <b>$14</b> for each <b>$1,000</b> or fraction over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Katonah</span></span><span class="s1">: Permits cost <b>$14</b> for every <b>$1,000</b> of a budgeted project.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Hastings-on-Hudson</span></span><span class="s1">: The fee will cost <b>$17</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of the estimated construction cost.<br /></span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Six Sweeten homeowners weigh in on staying or leaving during their remodel</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main points to consider when planning a renovation is how you&#8217;re going to minimize the disruption of daily life. It can be tricky if you are updating a kitchen or bathroom. Living without some elements will make surviving a renovation tough (running water, electricity, Wi-Fi), so moving out while work is being done is probably your best option. But if the renovation won&#8217;t affect your needs in a major way, then you might be able to stay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> <span class="s1">matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.. </span><span class="s1">Here are </span>six Sweeten homeowners who moved out—or stuck it out—during their renovation.</p>
<h3>Moving out during demolition</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="black-industrial-stairs-living-room"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44895 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3.jpg" alt="black industrial stairs leading to a living room with orange couch after renovation" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Carly&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/studio-loft-balcony-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new apartment</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carly had been looking—and saving—for years to buy an apartment of her dreams. So when she found this 500-square-foot co-op in Greenwich Village, she snapped it up. It was a studio with a  lofted bedroom and balcony—what more could she ask? It did need work, however. She wanted to literally raise the roof in order to enclose the loft bedroom and redo the kitchen. The entire renovation took five months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the interest of surviving her renovation, Carly decided to move out during the messiest part of the process: the demolition and raising the roof.  &#8220;For much of it, though, I was there,&#8221; said Carly. &#8220;I had no kitchen for six months and lived out of suitcases.&#8221; But she doesn&#8217;t regret &#8220;slumming it.&#8221; &#8220;The money I saved on short-term housing enabled me to buy the gas stove of my dreams!&#8221;</span></p>

The couple embarked on an Airbnb-hopping adventure when their lease ended before the work was done. They then decided to live on-site for the second half of the project.</p>

<h3>Expecting while renovating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32801 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Lindsay and Roger's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg" alt="moving out during a renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating the kitchen while nine months pregnant made getting around the apartment a challenge for Lindsay. &#8220;You think you can live through it for a week or two, and then realize how long a week or two really is. It would have been a nice break to go somewhere where there wasn’t dust and tools and boxes everywhere,&#8221; she said. To make it work, she moved everything from the kitchen and living room into the nursery. For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/the-best-renovation-advice-from-sweeten-homeowners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">future renovators</a>, she recommends going away for a weekend during heavy construction.</p>

<h3>Surviving their renovation: A couple toughs it out</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-frameless-glass-separator"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44896 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08.jpg" alt="white bathroom with frameless glass separator for white bathtub and floating vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Sharon and Laurence&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/large-scale-tile-financial-district-bathroom-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York City apartment</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharon and Laurence lived in their Financial District apartment for more than two decades before renovating their bathroom. They previously had remodeled their kitchen but were wary of redoing their bathroom. The couple only has one in their apartment so they thought it being out of commission would be tough. Sharon and Laurence ultimately decided to stay in the apartment during the renovation. It wasn&#8217;t ideal but they used a neighbor’s apartment for bathroom access. Sharon thought it was better to be living on-site to deal with potential issues quickly and efficiently.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Moving into a rental</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="large-minimalistic-living-room"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44897 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1.jpg" alt="large minimalistic living room with black framed glass door and two large windows after renovation" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) The light-filled renovated <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/family-remodel-design-forward-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living room</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For their family of five, these homeowners wanted an open and airy space. That meant renovating their Upper West Side home, adding another bedroom and bath. They also knocked down walls and updated their kitchen. They turned to Sweeten to find a reliable contractor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple decided to take their three boys (and two dogs) and move into a rental while the work was being done. “When I told our Sweeten contractor that we wanted to move back in before the apartment was completed, he worked with us to allow us to do that. Even though we lived there without a kitchen, there was no question that it would be worth it in the end.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<h3>Neighbors offer hospitality</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20250 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Nikki and Chris' kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-1-723x482.jpg" alt="moving out during a renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><span class="img-label"></a><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Nikki and Chris&#8217; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apartment renovation</span></span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nikki and Chris had to get creative to manage the challenges of being in the space mid-construction. &#8220;Through this experience, we showered at our friends’ homes, brushed our teeth at local coffee shops, and ordered from Seamless four times a week,&#8221; Nikki said. But it was all worth it to see the daily progress and watch the couple&#8217;s vision come to life. The routine became so natural that the couple&#8217;s pug started waiting at the door each morning to greet the contractor&#8217;s team when they arrived.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>7 ideas of custom bookcases to house a collection of books—whether you own 20 or 200</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you live with a book lover, you know that one book can quickly multiply into ten. It’s the kind of proliferation that seems to grow overnight, filling shelves, tabletops, and chairs until every surface is covered in books. But you don’t have to get rid of your treasure trove to reclaim your space (thank goodness!). Instead, think storage from custom bookshelves—from built-ins and open shelving to unique designs. For everyone who’s ever tripped over an errant book that found its way onto the rug, these custom bookshelf ideas from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> homeowners will come as a welcome relief.</p>
<h3>Statement bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26867 size-chrono" title="built-in bookcases around the fireplace" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Building custom bookcases around their <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/ventless-fireplace-chimney-not-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fireplace</a> was a must-have for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-bookcases-prewar-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat and Jordan</a>. Their generous collection of books needed a home. Looking to design a clean, modern home, built-ins and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating</a> for smooth walls did the trick. The varied spines of the books bring an added bonus of color and vibrancy to their space.</p>
<h3>Custom shelves for dining rooms</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38245 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg" alt="Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, dining room, renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most New Yorkers would choose to add more closets to their apartment, rather than remove them. But for Sheilaja and Sergio, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a renovation goal of having a larger, open dining room</a> was impeded by two closets in the entryway. They removed the closets and nearly doubled the size of their available space for the dining room. They added custom bookshelf storage in the dining room to showcase a mix of photographs, paintings, and drawings.</span></p>
<h3>Custom bookcases add hallway organization</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42025 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg" alt="book shelves" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-600x900.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooking and entertaining enthusiasts Jessica and Jesse bought their Clinton Hill co-op knowing <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/when-foodies-renovate-kitchen-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the apartment needed renovation help</a>, especially for their favorite room—the kitchen. During construction, their contractor reserved square footage from the kitchen to widen their hallway. This added space allowed them to add in a long, built-in custom bookshelf. A functional, expanded kitchen <em>and</em> more space in the foyer? That’s a renovation win-win.</span></p>
<h3>Built-in custom bookcases in a foyer</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50508 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A classic apartment problem: how to make the best use out of a small or oddly-shaped entryway. Luckily, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson Yards homeowners Jeremy and Chris</a> found a Sweeten contractor skilled in custom millwork to maximize their entryway. They solved their storage issue with a full-height bookcase with 8” deep shelves. A happy surprise: the 8&#8243; shelves hold much more than they expected!</span></p>
<h3>Wall-to-wall shelves for books, trinkets</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40479 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg" alt="living space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve said it before: the right general contractor really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make your design dreams come true</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> especially for a unique home feature. In Mimi’s case, her partnership with her contractor resulted in a custom, floor-to-ceiling, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/first-timer-gramercy-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18-foot bookshelf</a> for her Gramercy apartment.</span></p>
<h3>Save space with bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20600 size-chrono" title="bookshelves in the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14-723x477.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="477" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Floor space can be scarce in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studio or one bedroom</a>, a fact of life that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casey and Kumar</a> had accepted. Rather than building their custom bookshelves from the ground up, the couple placed them over the living room sofa. This allowed them to use the full length of the wall to fit as many shelves as possible. The storage keeps their collection organized and within reach, making it easy to grab a book for a good read.</p>
<h3>Naturally divide a room (and show off your literary collection!)</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39593 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-plan-living-when-lounging-meets-dining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open plan kitchen space</a> feel harmonious can be challenging, especially when the adjoining space is a living room. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/good-design-elevates-park-slope-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa and Russ</a> didn&#8217;t want to feel like they were always in their kitchen. To provide separation, they added a partial wall, which housed a customized, built-in bookshelf in their living room. To be complementary, their contractor built a frame for the bookshelf with a lacquer panel that matched the kitchen&#8217;s framing.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Are you satisfied with the overall look of the rooms of your house? Furniture and decor aside, does it have the character you crave? If not, consider introducing molding. The addition of trim along the ceiling, at the floor, and around doorways (even on walls) will add the depth and distinction you seek. This is true for new and old, modern and traditional houses alike. When introduced with imagination and care, molding also will boost the perceived value of a home.</p>

<h3>Crown molding styles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can add trim to just about any area of a room, from ceiling to floor, and areas in between. Some molding styles will work anywhere; others are designed to fit a specific location. Here’s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding &#8211; Just as the name indicates, crown molding crowns the room when placed at the seam or transition between the ceiling and the wall. Styles can be very simple or highly elaborate and combined to create a unique and refined installation. You can also work with a fabricator to design and cut from wood the exact look you want, but this will cost more than pre-made (see materials and profiles below).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Casing &#8211; This trim serves to conceal the gap between the wall and the door or window frame. With regard to doorways, it also helps to stabilize the opening, so this is one trim you don’t want to skip. Casing and baseboard should match or closely resemble each other for a cohesive look that doesn’t dominate a room (particularly one with a crown molding).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42943 size-full mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg" alt="Old house open concept" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><em>(<span style="color: #76808f;">Above)</span></em> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/1920s-house-remodel-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyli and Luke&#8217;s</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">picture frame molding jazzes up plain walls straight up the stairwell</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Chair rail &#8211; Functioning as both decoration and protection, a chair rail resides about halfway up a wall to protect the surface from dings from furniture placed close by. Decorative options abound here. As a natural separator, the areas above and below the chair rail may be painted a different color, or covered with wood paneling or wallpaper. Another practical benefit: if an area needs to be repaired, you don’t have to replace the surface material—paint or wallpaper—on the entire wall for a perfect match. You can just replace the damaged material above or below the molding.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Panel molding &#8211; This decorative molding is used to trim out raised-panel wall construction. Beadboard and wainscoting are a couple of examples.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Picture frame molding &#8211; This molding serves two types of applications. Use it to create a frame (or frame within a frame) on a wall, which can be further defined with paint, fabric, or wallpaper. Or run it along walls near the ceiling to support hooks for picture wires, eliminating nail holes in the wall.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Baseboards &#8211; Besides casing, this trim is the most common. It sits at the juncture between the wall and the floor. The purpose is twofold: to protect against shoe scuffs and to give the floor a finished appearance, hiding any separation that may occur as the room settles. You can go narrow or wide here, as your taste and the room’s style dictate.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Medallions &#8211; Typically used to conceal the opening through which a light fixture such as a chandelier descends, medallions are also decorative. Available in a range of sizes, apply one or several for pure embellishment on a wall, as an alternative to art.</li>

<h3>How to use decorative crown molding</h3>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding most commonly runs along the perimeter of two surfaces to conceal or soften the appearance of the transition between them. Think window frames or crown moldings, described above.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It can also be applied to pleasing and elegant effect to top cabinets or a bookcase, for a built-in, bespoke look.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding that is at least a couple inches deep can also serve as a wall shelf or plate rail in a kitchen.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Go even deeper and you can employ molding for a fireplace mantel.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Drop crown molding a few inches from the ceiling and light it for an extra touch of drama in a living or great room, or a romantic glow for a dining room. There are two-piece molding systems available with lights in the lower molding that project upward, illuminating the upper piece. Your contractor can help you create a similar effect with a strip of LED lights.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Also consider UL-Listed hollow crown molding that can hide common household wiring, good for a home office.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding materials and profiles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Molding is widely available through stores like Home Depot and Lowe’s as well as lumberyards and some hardware stores. You’ll find a vast selection of profiles—the shape or contour that you see when the molding is seen from its side—from crisp, straight edges to sensuous, elaborate curves. Stock items come in six- or eight-foot lengths.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Patterns &#8211; what you see from the front—include classic dentil and egg-and-dart, as well as floral and abstract designs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for what molding is made of, the most popular options include wood, of course, as well as MDF, plaster, and plastic. All of these materials can be painted, and the woods can be stained.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Wood &#8211; Wood molding comes in a variety of species, some hard like maple, and some soft like pine. Go for wood if you want to match walls of the same species or seek an effect from a distinctive grain, like that found in fir or oak. Wood takes stains, varnishes, clear coating, or paint. Some manufacturers will offer wood molding pre-primed and ready for painting.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For an authentic, historic look, check out salvage outlets for reclaimed wood molding from old, deconstructed houses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a natural material, wood will respond to changes in humidity so it’s not for rooms with a lot of moisture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28322 size-chrono" title="medallion molding" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="crown molding" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> </span><span class="s1"><span style="color: #76808f;">An elaborate ceiling medallion takes the contemporary edge off this hyper-modern kitchen in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavi and David&#8217;s</a><span style="color: #76808f;"> historic townhouse. Original molding frames the doorway.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">MDF &#8211; Made of wood fibers and resin, medium-density fiberboard (MDF) is a stable yet flexible material, suitable for surfaces that are not completely flat or even. It resists water better than wood and is lighter than plaster but heavier than the plastic options. It should come pre-primed, ready to paint or finish once installed.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Plaster &#8211; A time-honored molding material going back a couple centuries, plaster offers lots of choice in ornate designs. Since it’s also heavy and rigid, it’s not good for rooms where walls are not plumb. For experienced installers only!</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Plastic &#8211; There’s a range of options within plastics—polyurethane, polystyrene, PVC. All are flexible to conform to rooms with curves. They are also lightweight, and hence easier to handle than plaster and some woods. Of particular importance, plastics are waterproof, and so will not expand, constrict, split, or warp from exposure to changes in temperature or moisture, such as a kitchen or bath. They are also easy to cut and come ready to paint or faux finish.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Metal &#8211; This material is for rooms with stamped metal ceiling panels.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to install crown molding</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unless you are an experienced DIYer, it’s best to work with a pro when selecting the size of crown molding for a particular application. First, you or the contractor will need to match the molding to your home’s era and décor. Note that mid-century architecture, in its drive to streamline, did away with most ornamentation. Because of this, it will be hard to find crown molding examples from this time. However, very simple trim—molding, baseboard, and casings—can enhance even a very contemporary or minimal space to make the room feel truly finished. Here, paint the trim the same color as the walls.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pick the right crown molding for your home</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The array of styles and range of materials make molding a simple and fairly thrifty addition to a room—once you’ve made your selection! It can transform a room without requiring you to move a single wall or replace a bit of furniture. <span class="s1">If your home has a historic or traditional heritage, you have much more leeway for choosing different types of molding, including very elaborate styles. Look at pictures of historic homes online or in books for period-appropriate inspiration and guidance.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Dining in style, from kitchen tables to islands with seating</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the eat-in kitchen, the “eat-in” part is usually the last piece of the puzzle. Kitchen design typically revolves around cooking while the notion of dining in the space is often an afterthought. However, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a renovation platform connecting homeowners to a vetted general contractor, has seen a growing trend in considering both activities during the design stage. While small spaces demand multiple functionality in the kitchen, a more thoughtfully layout combines seating, a more organic flow, and space planning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Explore the possibilities that these Sweeten homeowners undertook with their eat-in kitchens, from dining tables to counter seating. All will invite family and friends to &#8220;break bread&#8221; with you at home!</p>
<h3>A kitchen banquette beckons for company</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43214" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg" alt="kitchen banquette" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With only one window in the kitchen to let in light, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/duplex-remodel-first-time-renovators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenn and Jon</a> took steps to create a brighter atmosphere for their family of four. A partial wall that sectioned off an eat-in area from the kitchen came down effectively joining the two spaces and letting the sunshine stream in. Cooking and eating together were top priorities and a U-shaped banquette lent a cozy gathering spot around the square-shaped dining table. Wallpaper and paneling give it separation and personality.</p>
<h3>A peninsula bar multitasks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41636" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="dining nook" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-riverdale-bronx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth and Martin</a>’s 124-square-foot galley kitchen, tackling the space planning and bringing a sense of openness was done with the help of their Sweeten design-build team. The couple&#8217;s comfort level for all of the renovation changes was put at ease with “sketches from every angle.” Pulling down two partial walls was step one in bringing in more light. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new peninsula bar seats four to five stools reminiscent of a cute bistro—and holds storage. Form and function increase with more prep space, glass-front cabinets, and a mix of finishes. Clutter minimizes with the microwave tucked behind a cabinet and the paper towel holder rolls out from under the countertop.</span></p>
<h3>More function for a larger kitchen</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42916" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1.jpg" alt="Townhouse renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/apartment-vs-house-a-brooklyn-family-decides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jill and Cy</a> created an open concept on the first floor of their single-family townhouse. The kitchen was expanded for the family of four by turning a full bath into a powder room giving more exposure to the black-trimmed doors leading to the backyard. With ample room, a dining table and chairs fit easily in the cook space for meals and entertaining. The flat-panel walnut cabinetry, ceiling light fixture, and furniture displayed the mid-century modern aesthetic. A cut-out window seat that doubles as storage was a bonus feature.</span></p>
<h3>Centerstage for an island</h3>

Aiming for the rustic look, two sides were live edge while the wood’s cherry red tone was lacquered. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The refrigerator was relocated within a row of existing closets off the kitchen proper creating a unified flow for the rest of the apartment. A disguised pantry covered in subway tile is a fun “Where’s Waldo?” moment. And that walnut slab? There was enough left over to fashion open shelving for the kitchen, home office, and the bathroom.</span></p>

Situated underneath the loft, a small dining table and chairs enhance the cozy grotto feel. Opting for an L-shaped layout, appliances moved along the back wall giving room to install plenty of countertop surface. A mix of stainless steel and white cabinets are backdrops to a glossy black tempered glass backsplash. </span></p>

</ul>
<h3>Bathroom need color</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Owners Rachel and Michael didn’t want to go super modern with their bathroom update, so they went with a classic look that complemented their apartment’s prewar roots. The original space was dark and in an uninspiring neutral, the shower was cramped and confined by uneven walls, and old chipped tile throughout had clearly seen better days.  A remodel was in order. The couple posted their project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose their contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43078 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Creating more space without changing the layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping the existing layout intact, Rachel and Michael made crucial updates, starting with tearing down the unnecessary wall framing of the shower<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>which added an extra nine inches to the height of the shower<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>and swapping the old glass door for a new one. With a bigger and brighter space to fill, a waterfall of penny tile in various shades of blue shines as a showpiece. The open and light-filled shower with its mosaic of tile is now Michael’s favorite part of the bathroom.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43069 size-full" title="Blue and white bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1.jpg" alt="blue bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43072 mb-0 size-full" title="Console sink and medicine cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3.jpg" alt="console sink" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A contrast between colors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A dusky shade of blue paint dominates the upper half of the walls while balancing the crackle-finish white subway tile with the right amount of contrast. White hexagon floor tile adds another layer of pattern. The tub also experienced a major improvement: out went the old tub with a clunky, external drainage system, and in went the new with an integrated system, vintage-style wall-mount tub filler, and a tiled tub surround.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43077" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43076" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Same bathroom, bigger feel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a month of going back and forth on deciding on the replacement, the couple switched out the boxy, builder-grade vanity for an open console design, making the space feel considerably larger. A mirrored medicine cabinet and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">triple-light fixture over the vanity</a>—Rachel’s favorite details—complete the look. The result? A room once bathed in beige gets new energy. [For these homeowners, an open-console vanity was a must.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Dust bunnies averted! Michael noted that his contractor did a spectacular job of keeping the bathroom clean, combating the huge amount of debris generated by the work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Whether they work simultaneously or on different timelines, their goal is one and the same</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind every renovation is a hardworking team that’s striving for one thing: executing a successful project. Homeowners come to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to find a general contractor who can reimagine their homes and sometimes bring along an interior designer who can help them visualize the new space. Other times, interior designers come directly to Sweeten to hire a general contractor for their clients’ projects. How a designer and contractor work together on a project varies case-by-case, sometimes they’re involved from the get-go, and other times a designer will come in post-construction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“General contractors are essential to our work,” said <a href="https://www.nysid.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYSID</a> faculty member Harry Heissmann. “While we can dream up and lay out rooms and houses, we need help executing our vision and while all of us are perfectly capable of supervising a job, the GC takes a lot of pressure off and organizes the different trades on a job according to a schedule. I always create an atmosphere of mutual respect right at the beginning, which in turn can make miracles happen.” See how these renovators partnered with a general contractor and designer to create their home sweet homes. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A dream came true for actor Danielle Brooks, who plays Taystee on the Netflix hit show <em>Orange is the New Black</em>: She owned her first home by the age of 30. Eager to make her mark in her new Brooklyn brownstone, she approached interior design duo, Jeanine Hays and Bryan Mason of <a href="https://www.aphrochic.com/">AphroChic</a> to meld her love of color, her draw to cultural heritage, and her sense of glamour. With a vision in place, the designers tapped Sweeten to find a general contractor who would set the stage with distinct Moroccan lighting, a sultry master bedroom painted in black, and African-inspired art. </span></p>
<p><i><span><img decoding="async" title="beige-walls-white-doors" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42245 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pixy-Interiors.jpg" alt="beige walls and white doors in a bedroom with white chest of drawers after renovation" width="1000" height="692" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pixy-Interiors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pixy-Interiors-300x208.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pixy-Interiors-600x415.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pixy-Interiors-585x405.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (Above) Dianna and Todd’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/small-space-renovation-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation on the Upper West Side</a></span></span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Dianna and Todd had long been planning to renovate their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">440-square-foot apartment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a roof-top blaze is what got their plans underway. They came to Sweeten to find a general contractor who amongst many things, advised on where to focus their attention, from refreshing the cabinetry instead of replacing it, to restaining and sanding the existing wood floors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the renovation was complete, they brought in interior designer Julia Oddo of </span><a href="https://www.tcinteriordesign.net/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TC Interiors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who created a scheme to complement the material choices—tans, blacks, and whites—the couple had already made with their contractor. In this case, the designer and the contractor were not working hand-in-hand throughout the project, but still wanted to create a great home for their client.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erica traded a Pepto-pink bathroom for a blush and chic retreat. Her renovation team, a Sweeten general contractor and interior designer </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/amyblumenthal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy E. Bishop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joined forces to revamp her Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, bath. Amy came up with design ideas, like the cascading statement wall and in-shower shelving, while the contractor brought them to fruition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, the built-in shelves were supposed to be on a different wall, but after the contractor discovered the wall was solid cement, the team reconsidered the location, moving the niches to the back wall instead. The renovation was a collaboration between all parties and resulted in a relaxing space for Erica.</span></p>

Originally, the kitchen was closed off from the rest of the living area, making it dark and cramped. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They decided to knock down the walls and let the light in from the living room windows. A mix of reflective and refractive materials help harness that light, too. Danielle, the principal and founder of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persephone Spring</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked hand-in-hand with the contractor to translate the vision, and select finishes from paint color to tile.</span></p>

The owners’ called on interior designer </span><a href="https://tarabenet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tara Benet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who then turned to Sweeten to hire a contractor to refresh what had become a tired and outdated space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From refinishing the floors to repainting the walls a slightly orange-tinted white and touching up millwork, the Sweeten general contractor created a new canvas for Tara to embellish with luxe furniture, lighting, and accessories.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studio Miller Atre conceived an idea that made each space feel distinct but connected and the general contractor executed their vision, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/good-design-elevates-park-slope-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building out custom cabinetry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and covering up once-exposed brick walls.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The results may surprise you</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47778 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Renovation-Stress-Survey-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Renovation-Stress-Survey-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Renovation-Stress-Survey-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With thousands of projects on Sweeten’s platform, we’re always looking for ways to minimize the stress of renovation—we do that by providing budget, estimate comparison and payment tools, matching homeowners with the best general contractors, following every project to completion, and sharing our homeowners’ stories. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To dig deeper into people’s biggest remodeling fears and pain points, we enlisted global market research firm Schlesinger Group to conduct our 2nd national renovation stress study. The survey of past, current, and future renovators across seven major U.S. cities gave us insight into what makes renovators’ hearts race—not in a good way—and how they approach a major project. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, seeing that 85% of homeowners consider remodeling stressful is not a shocker (though the fact that Los Angeles homeowners top the list of saying it’s “extremely stressful” was of note). Below are just some of the highlights from a hefty report that includes interesting geographical differences. We read every word to problem-solve and make the process as transparent as possible.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>1. Planning is the most stressful stage.<br />
</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yes, even more than demolition or relocation. Fifty-nine percent of those surveyed placed planning in their top three most stressful renovation steps. The good news? Our blog has plenty of <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-101/"><span class="s2">guides on pricing, timing, and other must-knows</span></a> to make renovation easier. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47779" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stats-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="400" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stats-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stats-1-300x120.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stats-1-600x240.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>2.</strong><b> Going over budget is a top concern<span>—</span></b><b>but most people don’t do that.<br />
</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not so surprising, but important nonetheless. Of those who said they went over budget, the majority actually only spent 10% more than they’d budgeted, so even though missing the money mark is a big-time fear, the amount overspent is less than you’d think. We actually advise renovators to build in a 10% cushion to the budget on all projects. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">NOTE: When you post a project on Sweeten, our platform pre-populates the various elements involved and pricing down to every last detail, from cabinet installation to floor replacement, providing a much simpler way to look at the big picture (and granular) costs. Our platform also provides a bid-leveling service to compare contractor estimates for an apples-to-apples analysis to make the smartest decision for what you’re trying to accomplish.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>3.</strong> <b>Renovation shows and videos are a major learning source.</b> </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While a renovation is really not like what you see on a 30-minute TV show, 57% of survey participants watch homes transform on TV and/or the Internet. Our advice? Get inspiration and ideas, get a sense of what a post-demolition space looks like—but don’t make assumptions about how your own project or experience will turn out based on the made-for-screen remodels. (You don’t REALLY believe you can overhaul your living space in 48 hours, right?)</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>4.</strong> <b>Men are more trusting; women need a call.</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When it comes to general contractors (GCs), men have a higher overall opinion of them (68% vs. 62%). Women place the highest importance on contractors returning calls quickly (67% to 58%) and are most often deterred by a contractor who’s difficult to get ahold of (67% to 58%). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At Sweeten, we agree that communication and chemistry are key!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47783" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stats-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stats-2-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stats-2-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stats-2-1-600x300.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p><em><span class="s1">With a hair product line expanding in the U.S., London-based brand, Johnny’s Chop Shop settled on Williamsburg for its first American location. To start, Steven Ross decided to revamp a spot that was in complete disrepair and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service to match him with a vetted general contractor. And to maintain a consistent message on brand, materials, and design, the majority of millwork and finishes, similar to those in the other locations, were fabricated in the U.K. and shipped stateside. The result: A barber shop that introduces the art of grooming to a new generation. </span></em></p>

As of this year, they are in 3,500 <a href="https://www.walmart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart</a> stores. We felt it was important to have a barber shop in the U.S. to strengthen the authenticity of the brand. Our first shop opened in London five years ago and we now have five locations.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Where did the idea for the business come from?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Steven:</strong> Barbering has been growing in popularity with the Millennials not only in visiting barber shops but in using products in their hair. I wanted to be part of that journey and create a brand that resonated with our target audience.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the opening of this new location?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Steven:</strong> We thought, “Where is the coolest city in the U.S.A.?” New York City was the answer. Then we asked what was the coolest neighborhood in the city, and of course, we came up with Williamsburg.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How does your new shop design represent your brand?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Steven:</strong> I am passionate about design, and the influence for this new location is Americana with a modern twist and quite a few nods to England. </span><span class="s1">The tiger neon sign was brought in from the U.K. It has a very high wattage and needed a special transformer. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How was your vision executed by working with your Sweeten general contractor? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Steven:</strong> Working in NYC is a far cry from working in the U.K. There are many more hurdles to get over in New York and is more expensive. I was lucky to stumble across the Sweeten site and find a contractor who has proven to be reliable, honest, and helpful.  </span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="s4"><strong>Steven:</strong> When a corroded main support beam was exposed, they helped shore it up and work with a structural engineer to find the best long-term solution. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do you think Sweeten can help entrepreneurial business owners like yourself?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Steven:</strong> Sweeten gave me the confidence to pick a contractor especially since I had to do it from across the pond. It is really a useful and helpful tool. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Peter-Kitchen_Bed-05.jpg" alt="sunken living room in junior studio renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56702" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Peter-Kitchen_Bed-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Peter-Kitchen_Bed-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Peter-Kitchen_Bed-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> </span></p>
<p><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner Paul had to decide whether to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-studio-renovates-one-bedroom-hells-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live in or move out</a> during his renovation</span></p>
<h3>Evaluate your scope and plan ahead</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It’s no secret that construction work is messy and disruptive in any home. It can stir up old toxins and generate dust. Key parts of your home may be unusable for days or weeks. The impact affects both the homeowner and the general contractor: renovations may interrupt your day-to-day life and homeowners may also get in the way of the progress, too. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The best possible option to minimize inconveniences and speed up work is to move out during the renovation. However, moving out can add significantly to the budget and complexity of renovating. It isn’t necessary for every project though. We suggest a variety of ways to make it through the transition time.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Do you want to survive your renovation in one piece? Ask yourself these questions before making your decision:</strong></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are you renovating?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Is your project a gut renovation? Are you renovating a room that you can’t live without for more than a few days? Have a clear-eyed look at your household’s daily needs and discuss the work schedule with your contractor. They will help you understand where you’ll have access and where use (and peace!) may be compromised.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A gut renovation takes over the home for weeks or months and moving out is generally the best option. This allows work to move forward holistically throughout the space and keeps you away from toxins. Some renovators opt to extend an existing lease while a new space is renovated. Others stay with family or friends while many turn to <a href="https://streeteasy.com/"><span class="s2">StreetEasy</span></a> for a long-term or short-term lease or broker.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/116726-Sally-Morgridge-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowners" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56466" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/116726-Sally-Morgridge-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/116726-Sally-Morgridge-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/116726-Sally-Morgridge-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) For Sally and Aaron, it was hard to <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/office-kitchen-becomes-a-family-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #76808f;">get by without a kitchen</a> with two young children. <em>&#8220;We stayed at my mom’s apartment over a few of the weekends, but weeknights were a struggle. Luckily, the contractors were friendly with the kids!&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you are renovating a critical space like a kitchen or bathroom, <span class="s2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor Ronald </span>encourages clients to move out during the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/8-ways-minimize-mess-home-renovation/"><span class="s2">dusty demolition phase</span></a>, at a minimum. After demolition, your use of the kitchen or bathroom could be compromised or off-limits entirely for days or weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you’re renovating a kitchen and plan on staying, be prepared to order a lot of takeout (and add that expense to your budget). Or organize a makeshift kitchen with an electric hot plate and microwave with water from the bathroom sink. A bathroom renovation can be more tricky if you only have one. Talk with your contractor about whether your toilet or shower will be off-line and for how long.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Live in or move out during a renovation: Check your budget</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Can you stretch your budget? The best time to have your answer on staying or going is as soon as possible. That way, you can include the additional expense for a hotel or a short-term apartment rental in your initial budget. It can be attractive to plan a vacation during some part of the renovation. However, most projects benefit from regular site visits and communicating with your contractor. Therefore, leaving town altogether requires especially good communication and planning.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito.jpg" alt="" width="2948" height="2012" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24064" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito.jpg 2948w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito-723x493.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito-300x205.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito-600x409.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2948px) 100vw, 2948px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #76808f;">(<i>Above</i>) Sweeten homeowners <span class="s2">Allison and Jovito</span> say stay:  “<i><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #76808f;">Living in the house during construction</a> wasn’t fun…On the plus side, it was exciting for us to see the team’s daily progress and some of the relics they unearthed during demolition.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Consider carefully that construction can affect children. It can also be an issue for adults with health issues. If your home was built before 1978, the walls may have been coated in a lead-based paint (In 1978, lead-based paint was <a href="https://www.epa.gov/lead/protect-your-family-exposures-lead"><span class="s2">banned</span></a>.) that can release toxins when the paint is sanded or removed. That’s why general contractors are required to test for lead-based paint in older homes. It’s also why the decision to live in or move out during a renovation carries extra weight when children are involved. There are harmful materials that are easy to touch and ingest. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Toxins can have varying effects on adults. Although human bodies can filter out some toxins, adults who are “immunocompromised” can be more sensitive, according to Robert Weitz, from <a href="https://rtkenvironmental.com/"><span class="s2">RTK Environmental Group</span></a>, which tests homes for toxins. Asthma sufferers can also have a harder time. “Adults filter particles through their nose hairs, but for someone who is sensitive, that would certainly be a big “no” to being anywhere near that work environment,” said Robert.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is the layout of your home?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Along with the scope of your project, the layout of your home could affect your decision. It&#8217;s possible to separate a renovation occupying one level of a multistory home from the remaining living space, Ronald said. If it’s an apartment with only one point of entry, this becomes more difficult. “If the general contractor team doesn’t have another way to get into the work area, of course, they are going to bring in dust on their clothing, in their hair,” said Robert. Renovations can create dust so fine a human eye can’t see it. That dust can also pass through a typical vacuum cleaner filter, Robert said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Christopher-Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="portrait of family live in move out during bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56703" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Christopher-Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Christopher-Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Christopher-Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #76808f;">(<i>Above</i>) Sweeten homeowners <span class="s2">Chris and Lisa</span> did both<i>:</i> <i>“I took the kid and dog to my sister’s house upstate. Chris had to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/renovators-return-bathroom-kew-gardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #76808f;">live in the space during construction</a> due to work. Thankfully the building has a basement bathroom that he had access to, and friends were nice enough to let him use their showers.”</i></span></p>
<h4>Regulating the air</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Contractors can take certain steps to reduce the spread of dust and toxins to other parts of the home. Most likely, the renovation is sectioned off with tape and thick plastic. Negative air pressure also stops contaminated air from leaving the renovation zone whenever a worker exits or enters. Ronald uses a water mister in the renovation area; damp air limits the dust from traveling around the home.</span></p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">If you’re doing a lengthy renovation of a vital room (a kitchen or only bathroom) you may need to stay elsewhere. Some homeowners opt to stay with friends or family until the space is reusable, others find short-term rentals to live in for the duration of the renovation. </p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639487432777"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How to live through a home renovation</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Clearly understand your household’s daily needs and discuss the work schedule with your contractor. This will help you understand where you’ll have access and where usage (and peace!) may be compromised. Are you doing a gut renovation? Are you renovating a room that you can’t live without for more than a few days? Knowing the answers to these will help you determine whether you can (or should) stay in the home, or live offsite during the renovation. </p>

<h3>A fresh minimalist space</h3>
<p><span class="s1">A Manhattan apartment with wall-to-wall windows overlooking Park Avenue demands an undistracting interior. That’s just one reason why it was a match for John, a minimalist seeking to upsize in the city. The finance exec closed on the two-bedroom abode in the Murray Hill neighborhood and was committed to an expansive renovation before moving in. Aspiring to a modern, clean aesthetic, he hired <a href="https://aurorafarewell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architect and designer Aurora Farewell</a>, who works in New York and Connecticut, to oversee the project and to take the space to spare and spectacular. Aurora posted the project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, and together with John chose their Sweeten contractor. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41911 size-full" title="portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19.jpg" alt="portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="s1">For John, the decision to finally purchase an apartment of his own in Manhattan was two-fold. First, he’d been renting for years, initially a studio and then a one-bedroom apartment, both in a nearby area of Midtown East, and he wanted more space. Second, he was ready for a serious investment: John wanted to begin building equity in a luxury apartment. What better place than in a full-service condo on a prime Park Avenue block? </span></p>

<h3>Expanding living space</h3>
<p><span class="s1">The 1,200-square-foot unit, which had giant, greenhouse-style windows in nearly every room, was in an upscale building in the high 30s, and had everything—room to stretch, impressive sunlight, and 24-hour views of one of the city’s best architectural catwalks.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">John lived in his former apartment until his new home renovation was complete. “I closed on it in July 2018 and the renovation began in October,” he said, after he had obtained building and city approvals. The new apartment, he said, more or less doubled his living space. John was an experienced renovator, having done previous construction on homes in Utah and Florida. He had a vision and a good idea of how he wanted to approach the redo. “The biggest questions I had,” he said, “were ‘<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How much will this cost</a>?’ and ‘How long will it take?’”</span></p>

<h3>Taking down walls</h3>
<p><span class="s1">The unit, in a 20-year-old building, had a layout that felt inefficient, if not unlivable, John said. His biggest gripe was an awkward partition wall that closed off the kitchen from the living and dining rooms. </span><span class="s2">According to his architect, they worked to create an open floor plan unifying the kitchen, dining, and living spaces, “as well as to allow for a more gracious master bath and master bedroom.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Next, they moved on to a long list of features and finishes, all of which, John said, was “in working condition, but dated.” A simple design was needed based on clean lines and spare decor. He favored neutral “background” colors on walls, floors and cabinets, and furnishings that were practical and useful.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41910 size-full" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-18.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Practical goals</h3>
<p><span class="s1">Aurora agreed with John’s ideas and thought they meshed perfectly with her own vision, focused largely on the apartment’s bank of east-facing windows. “The </span><span class="s2">tall panes of glass overlook the stately building façades that line Park Avenue, and up to the sky,” she said. “The morning light in the apartment was beautiful, and I wanted to fix the layout so that John could appreciate it in full.” As it was, she said, the window wall’s impressive span was broken by the kitchen partition, plopped right in the middle of—and from either side blocking—the breathtaking view.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">After reviewing the multiple Sweeten bids, Aurora and John decided on their contractor, who coordinated with them and advised on a number of aspects of the project. In addition to the literal big picture, Aurora and John had practical goals. “I was hoping to not have to use my oven for file storage anymore,” he said, stressing that this was not an exaggeration. </span></p>
<p><span class="s3"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41907 size-full" title="dining space" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15.jpg" alt="dining space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41894 mb-0 size-full" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-02.jpg" alt="bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Adding hidden storage</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Seeking to maximize the amount of storage space in the apartment without compromising on design, they decided to rip out the wall between the kitchen and dining area, which came at the expense of the pre-existing utility closets that had been built into it. To compensate, the contractor built two closets on opposite walls of the dining area, one to accommodate coats and luggage, and the other to store sporting goods and other sundry stuff. With that wall out of the way, the contractor’s team installed the new kitchen comprising slate-gray designer cabinetry, Calacatta marble countertops, and high-end stainless-steel appliances.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Storage was a priority for other rooms as well. In the master bedroom, the plan dictated bumping into the current clothes closet, which would then be expanded on the opposite side, in addition to building a new shoe closet. The guest bedroom, which would also function as John’s home office, would be kitted out with enclosed cabinets and shelving.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41895 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03.jpg" alt="bathroom cabinet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Gutted bathrooms with complete upgrades</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The bathrooms, both of which were gut-renovated, received complete upgrades with porcelain tile, patterns, and custom millwork. In the master bathroom, Aurora increased the functionality with a new linen closet, which the contractor bumped into a wall in order to build. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The<span style="color: #333333;"> six-</span>month renovation went smoothly, John said, with “no major hiccups along the way,” save the necessary pulling of an unanticipated permit from the New York City Department of Buildings before the removal of the kitchen partition. The wall, the architect explained, was non-load-bearing but still tricky to take down, since it was part of the building’s original construction plan.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41896 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3>Crediting the contractors</h3>
<p><span class="s1">John credited his Sweeten contractor as a key player in the project, noting that the building team was among the critical reasons why the project was a success. He suggested taking all you can from the experts you’ve assembled to help you through the project, while at the same time tuning in to your own intuition. “Once you make a decision,” he said, “stick with it. Otherwise, you run the risk of not only second-guessing yourself, but of delaying delivery of materials and installation. If one step in the process is delayed, it can have a domino effect on subsequent tasks.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">John said that those steps, at least when they proceeded smoothly, were some of the most satisfying components of the job, day-by-day, and week-by-week, as he watched his new space change. What came slowly at the beginning then accelerated, transforming to progress and carrying through to a pleasing conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I feel,” John said, “like I’ve found not just a place to live and sleep, but a permanent home in the city.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you, John, for sharing your new home with us!</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">DESIGN NOTES FROM ARCHITECT AURORA FAREWELL AS TOLD TO SWEETEN:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">We wanted to appreciate the natural light in full. Unfortunately, it was interrupted by the dividing wall, home to closets and a massive fridge. We agreed a continuous row of windows would be better. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We relied on light fixtures to act as focal points in the space and to illuminate the client’s artwork without needing to use additional art lights. Two brass wall sconces are placed strategically in the living room to provide ambient light, and a statement fixture anchors the kitchen area,  illuminating across the entire length of the island. Both this and the oversized dining room pendant act as sculptural elements. Carefully placed 3-inch ceiling soffits facilitated critical adjustments in architectural lighting, including the addition of the beautiful kitchen island pendant, without sacrificing overall ceiling height. The fireplace surround and hearth were redone in slate with a minimal, painted mantel.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The master bathroom is clad in large-format porcelain tile in light-gray veining chosen for durability and aesthetic appeal, with just enough pattern to not overwhelm the space. The bathroom is timeless and the combination with porcelain tile and minimal grout mean that it will remain pristine for years to come. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">The interior finishes and furnishings internalize the terra cottas and wrought-iron tones from the streetscape, placing the emphasis on the view beyond the windows. </span><span class="s1">The flooring throughout the apartment a light-toned wood-topped engineered floor from PID that the client chose himself. Leather-clad bar stools and a small table bring warmth to the space, while ceramics in the window lend scale to the buildings beyond.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nearly 25 years ago, the homeowners were on the hunt for a three-bedroom rental with more space for their two children—who’d long been sharing a bedroom. They stumbled upon a Chelsea apartment, converted from a factory space, that was actually for sale. They agreed to go through with buying their first place—where they’ve lived ever since. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the couple had their kitchen renovated, but left every other room intact—until they decided to remodel the guest bathroom. “It was embarrassingly retro. The faucets didn’t work, there was a gap behind the sink. It just looked old,” they shared. Another priority? To convert the bathtub into a walk-in shower. “My dad, who is in his 90s, stays with us a lot, too,” one of the homeowners shared, so that update was especially important to give him easier access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/admin/projects/32293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project to Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4845#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who would provide design and build help to modernize the space. Guidance picking out and sourcing materials was the main factor in their decision. “Other contractors facilitate the project, file the permits, demolish, install, etc—but then I would’ve had to go find the sink, the toilet, the faucet. This contractor offered to help us find all of our materials, it was part of their service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img decoding="async" title="beige-bathroom-wall-tiles"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48774 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Beige bathroom wall tiles with white pedestal sink along with white bathtub and toilet before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><strong>After</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Before work could begin, the building’s co-op board engineer presented a list of possible requirements, from waterproofing to disability access.  The contractor had to apply for a lot of permits, and at one point in the process, the Sweeten Client Services team stepped in to facilitate an issue and get communication between the homeowner and contractor back on the right track.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubNuCmtu1M8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the approval and permits were all set, the couple and their Sweeten contractor got to work on finding materials that aligned with their vision of a clean, classic black-and-white bathroom. They all went to a showroom together to see what caught the renovators’ eyes, including a dotted marble floor tile. The homeowners love natural stone material, so they opted for a Calacatta porcelain tile for the shower walls. The vanity is a custom piece that ties in the bi-tonal color palette and offers plenty of storage. An offset sink (we’re seeing more and more of these) lends one side of the counter for more storage, too.</span></p>

The contractor&#8217;s designer was the perfect partner for us,” they shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contracting team was diligent about cleaning up the dust every single day since the homeowners were living at home during the renovation. The guest bathroom is near the entryway and was cordoned off for construction. “They all took the job seriously, completed the job with meticulous work, and got it done pretty quickly. We saw real care,” the homeowners said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the timeline shifted a bit given the board approval challenges, once the process got rolling, it was finished in six weeks (and just in time for a birthday party the couple was hosting.) </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The renovators were so amazed by the hard work of each subcontractor that handled the demolition, electrical, lighting, and tiling. “I was struck by the uniformly high quality no matter which team it was,” one homeowner shared.</span></p>
