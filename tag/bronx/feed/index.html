<h3>Setting goals for a new home</h3>
<p>We bought this house with dreams of a live/work space that would reflect our style and offer plenty of room for our art collection. Steve is a painter, so having his studio at home was a life-long dream. We also wanted a place where our friends and large extended family could come together.</p>

<p>We are Steve DeFrank and Lewis Holman. Steve teaches at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. Lewis is self-employed as a tax accountant. We sold our loft condo in Williamsburg after living in it for nearly 15 years to <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/townhouse-renovation-guide-purchasing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchase a small townhouse</a> in the South Bronx.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>From a two-family to a single-family rowhouse</h3>
<p>The engineer&#8217;s report on our 1882 rowhouse in Mott Haven, the Bronx, looked good, but we still wanted a gut renovation. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structure has three stories</a> comprising roughly 1,500 square feet. The home had been divided into two apartments and had eight rooms on two of the floors. We wanted to renovate and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convert to a single-family home</a> to accommodate a live/work situation.</p>

<p>We listed our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and began our search for <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/bronx-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design-build services in the Bronx</a>. Sweeten’s introduction to our Bronx contractor and architect was a valuable service. As first-time renovators, our biggest question before starting was how much <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overhauling the home would cost</a>. the project were about cost. In addition to an in-home studio, we wanted to open up every floor of the building, giving us fewer walls and more windows. We understood that altering the building in this way would be an investment.</p>
<p>The plan we made with the architect was for the ground floor to be Steve’s studio and a water closet—a bathroom with the sink outside. The middle floor would be the living and dining rooms, plus <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a customized kitchen</a> and a half bath. On the top floor would be our bedroom and a home office/guest bedroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a remodeled full bath</a>, and a laundry closet.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned for a true gut renovation</a>—nothing was in good enough shape to retain. Our Sweeten contractors demolished down to the bricks and joists, all of which had to be replaced or sistered; this was necessary to allow removal of the central beam, which had to be done to open up the ground- and middle-floor spaces.</p>
<h3>Radiant heat and functional stairs</h3>
<p>Throughout the home, we aimed for low-maintenance, design-worthy materials to evoke an aesthetic of warm minimalism. We wanted expansive wall space for hanging artwork. The ground-level studio interior is an open workspace with recessed LED lighting, a lot of artist’s storage, and radiant-heat flooring—which we installed on all levels. To bring as much light as possible to the studio, we opened the rear wall with an 8’ x 9’ three-panel glass sliding door.</p>
<p>We decided to remove the original front stoop and relocate the house’s entrance to the ground floor, which created some challenges. Our architect Shannon envisioned—and our Sweeten contractor produced—a storage unit that divides the entry area from the studio space. We had hoped to save the original interior staircase and railing, but our Sweeten contractor showed us options that made more sense.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we closed the stairs from the ground floor to the first to create more wall space in the studio; we chose a vivid pink hue for the risers, which brightens the whole entrance. On the parlor and top floors, we went with a wood stair-rail that looks simultaneously classic and modern. In the end, we were very happy that we took our contractor’s advice.</p>

<h3>Connecting all of the floors</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vision for the kitchen</a> included custom millwork with the front panels painted green evoking the palest verdigris. Our island, which has an angled front, is an homage to artist Donald Judd. We rented nearby during renovations and observed this living area coming together. Visiting the site at least twice a week, we loved seeing the gradual progress, sometimes glacial and sometimes lightning quick.</p>

<p>A dining-area drawer and shelving system provides storage and connects these rooms to the top floor, where the main bedroom and home office also employ coordinating storage units. We had fun with tile to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modernize the full bath</a> upstairs, where we mixed matte and glossy tile in a range of sizes and colors, including chartreuse, dark green, and gray-green.</p>
<h3>A building exterior refresh</h3>
<p>The elimination of the parlor-floor entrance led to an anomaly on the front of the house, with regards to the living-room windows. The window occupying the old door frame is much larger than the window next to it. The architect’s solution—a modular window design, made up of a series of smaller frames, one of which mirrors the smaller window to create a visual connection.</p>

<h3>Steve and Lewis’ renovation advice</h3>
<p>Throughout the job, we enjoyed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaborative exchange with our contractor</a> and architect. As first-time (and last!) renovators, we’d embarked on possibly the most stressful project of our lives. Luckily, we had <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chosen the right team</a> carefully. Our contractor and crew kept a sense of humor during a long, arduous process.</p>
<p>Our advice to other <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowners ready for a renovation</a>: Anticipate bad news and delays, and roll with the punches. Be grateful for the opportunity you have, even when you wonder why you ever thought it was a good idea! And remember, issues that arise and seem monumental during the process get solved, and are forgotten once you move in. Now when we enter our home, we feel serene.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A year and a half into owning and living in their Riverdale, Bronx, home Elizabeth and Martin were ready to renovate their 124-square-foot galley kitchen. Inspired by other remodeled kitchens in their 1955 co-op building, they got an idea for how they could transform the layout to better suit their needs. Elizabeth, a research analyst for a public policy consulting firm, and Martin, a product designer for a video streaming company, posted their </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">project on Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a design-build firm</span></a> where they worked with both a designer and a contractor.</p>

Knocking down walls between the kitchen and the entryway area to bring in more natural light. Their contractor also took down a partial wall between the kitchen and dining space to connect them. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to make the most of our floor space, have an open layout, and have comfortable dimensions for navigating the kitchen. We wouldn’t have felt as confident in our decision making in this area, but having the designer’s expertise and experience to make layout recommendations and to see her sketches (from every angle!) of the design made us comfortable with the plan, “ Elizabeth shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renovators wanted a clean and classic kitchen with plenty of prep space and minimal clutter. They worked with the designer to come up with practical storage solutions, including a set of glass-front cabinets, microwave cabinet, and built-in paper towel holder. The peninsula breakfast bar seats four to six and offers additional storage, too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth and Martin shopped with their designer to pick out materials, including the lava stone backsplash and quartz countertop. Copper cabinet hardware pops against the white custom cabinets and adds to the mix of metals (matte black for the sink faucet and stainless steel appliances).</span></p>

Our contractor helped by providing a detailed scope of work and being communicative and responsive to emails throughout the project.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They relied on Sweeten from the get-go for reviewing and </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leveling quotes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But, most importantly, “knowing Sweeten was available and present to step in if needed, offered us a lot of peace of mind throughout the planning and execution of our renovation,” Elizabeth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their new space reinvigorated Martin&#8217;s love for cooking and unlike pre-renovation, the couple actually enjoys spending time together in their kitchen now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The couple adopted a cat, Norah J., as their renovation wrapped up. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After&#8221; photos by Miao Jiaxin for Sweeten</span></i></span></p>
<h3>Before: The co-op apartment’s two bathrooms were too small for a wheelchair or walker</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debbie’s father moved out of the two-story home he’d lived in for 25 years into a co-op apartment in the Bronx so he’d have greater mobility. While the rest of his new 900-square-foot apartment offered enough space for him to move around in his wheelchair or walker with ease, the bathrooms were a different story. Both the powder and the full-size bath layouts made it nearly impossible for anyone to assist him. There were no disability bars, and her father was unable to get in and out of the tub. Aesthetically, they were “dark, dingy, and unwelcoming,” Debbie said.</span></p>

<h3>Feeling confident in the right general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The thought of having to get the space ready for my father was overwhelming before I found Sweeten,” Debbie said. She scoured the blog to research</span> general costs<span style="font-weight: 400;">, the pros and cons of materials, and design ideas to be as informed as possible. “By the time I learned enough about the potential hazards and hurdles of renovation, and of the joys and successes, I felt confident that I was making a solid decision,” she continued. And with that, Debbie</span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/28683" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">posted her project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten and was matched with a </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches home renovators with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>After: Renovating for a larger square footage with safety and functionality features</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They combined the two small rooms into a single, efficient bathroom with adequate space for Debbie’s father. Sticking to a white-and-gray color scheme made it feel more light and joyful, too. The walk-in shower featured a disability bar and pull-down seat for safety. Shelves were installed in the location of one of the former sinks, optimizing what would have otherwise been a wasted area of the bathroom and providing</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">additional storage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debbie’s vision of “a bright, safe space completed with good materials that would last and looked nice&#8221; came to fruition. And, most importantly, her father loves it. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Her takeaway? Research is key before starting a renovation project. “You have to really think about who will use the space, and what’s best for them so that you can design something to support their needs,” Debbie said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Finally, a happy home after bumps and delays</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>For a dozen years, Tara and Mike lived in a tiny studio apartment on the Upper West Side. A move uptown, to the Grand Concourse Historic District of the Bronx, landed them in a much larger home in a 1930s co-op building. In 2015, they moved in and up against no deadlines to renovate, carefully thought through the changes they wanted to make and assembled photos and information that a contractor could use to bring their visions to life. Read on for the full story of how they gutted two full baths, enlarged closets (one of which now fits three bikes!), and lived to tell the tale of not one, but two, plumbing disasters.</em></p>

<em>Guest post by Bronx homeowner Tara</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We purchased this apartment a few years ago, after living in a 250-square-foot apartment on the West Side for about 12 years. Going from a studio apartment to a 3-bed, 2-bath was a big leap. The kitchen had already been renovated by the previous owners, so we only had to deal with the outdated bathrooms. Leaky toilets, hot water surges, and ugly yellow tile were just a few of the things we needed to remedy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We took our time in the beginning, even before <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/8457" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting our project to Sweeten</a>, to lay out exactly what we wanted room by room. We had a document with photos ready to hand to any contractor who we contacted. This made it easy for us and the contractor to make sure we were all on the same page from the start. We were also never in a rush to start the work. We started looking for a contractor at least four months before we were even ready to think about putting any money down. This gave us the luxury of taking our time to choose the firm that was right for us.</p>

(Above) Master bath</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We ended up going with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten design-build firm</a>. We wanted a design-build firm from the start so that someone would take charge of sourcing and delivery of all the various components of our job. Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a> included line items for everything we could possibly need, and we were free to select the fixtures that fit within the budget. When something we wanted was out of range, we either decided to find an alternative or paid the difference upfront. We also needed someone who could handle all of the Department of Buildings permits, as well as our co-op’s application process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had a specific vision for this renovation. We planned to gut the bathrooms and add ceiling fans in all of the bedrooms and living room, new radiator covers in the bedrooms, and lighting and doors throughout. The bathroom in the master was very narrow, and we wanted to move the tub out of the guest bath and into the master. Moving the location of the tub, and expanding the bathroom by about two feet, solved the narrowness issue.</p>

(During) Master bath ceiling reveals a waste line wrapped in duct tape<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30673 mt-24 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06.jpg" alt="renovator Bronx" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt06-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>We really were excited to pick out all the new fixtures and tiles for the bathrooms. Our contractor offered several options within our budget. We wanted to see and touch the cabinets and faucets before committing to them. Our thinking was if we’re going to be living with these things for years to come, we needed to like how they felt, and more importantly, wanted to see the quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We visited several showrooms in the NYC area to see the Kohler line of cabinets and the Brizo faucets that we ultimately chose. We liked the Fantini sink faucet and shape of the handles for the guest bath; it also matched the black finish of the Brizo line used in the shower. To keep the ordering simple, we used the same family of fixtures and cabinets in both bathrooms, with different finishes for each.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We chose a fun feature as an accent in the shower: a round tile in shades of white, blue, and green from a company called Clayhaus in Oregon. Our biggest challenge was timing the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">special order and delivery</a> around the completion of the first bathroom. The tiles took about six weeks to fabricate, and we ended up being about two weeks off. Luckily, the crew had other projects around our apartment to complete while waiting for the tile to arrive.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When our master bath ceiling was opened up during demolition, the contractor found that the waste line from the toilet above had been wrapped in duct tape during a prior renovation. We immediately reported this to building management, who arranged to have the pipe replaced. Their plumber worked with our contractor to gain access, and within a day the situation was resolved.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Enlarging the master bath with extra square footage resulted in an added benefit, giving us space in our bedroom to accommodate a large dresser next to the newly combined <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closets</a>.<br />
In the guest room, we widened the closet to make it suitable for bike storage. We can now get three bikes in there with room for other gear along the sides and floor.</p>

<p>During the renovation, we had no options for moving off-site, but having a contractor who understood our needs, and the fact that we would be <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living on site</a> the entire time, made the process bearable. The first few weeks of disruption were the hardest, but we settled into a routine and focused on the outcome. And because we were dealing with two bathrooms, we could only start the second one when the first was completed.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30682 size-full" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before02.jpg" alt="renovator Bronx" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt_Before02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt12.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30684 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt12.gif" alt="SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt12" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30683 mb-0 size-full" title="hallway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt10.jpg" alt="renovator Bronx" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt10-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While our own renovation went smoothly, with all pipes and fittings replaced and brought up to code, it was an external problem that delayed the final weeks of work. Nearing what would have been the end of the project, we came home to water pouring down from a bathtub located in the apartment two floors above us. An older pipe leading from the tub drain had eroded completely and detached from the waste line. Bath water had been spilling down for hours while we were at work. Our crew was not on site that day, and the unit above ours was vacant. With no one to report the leak, it was ours to deal with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That was the most devastating moment because we were so close to completion but now had to deal with the clean-up and dry-out of brand new walls and flooring. We put in a claim with our insurance carrier to cover the cost of the repairs, and wanted our team to do the work, since they were still on site, knew our building and our home. We could trust them to work unsupervised. They were willing to stick around and do this repair, but it was at least three months and multiple visits by an insurance adjuster before we could agree on a scope of work and monetary settlement. Luckily, both bathrooms were still usable and we made sure there was no mold growing between the walls. When all was said and done, both spaces were finished about ten months after the start date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to the start of the renovation, our biggest question was whether we would be able to find a reliable contractor. We would be trusting them with our home, our valuables, and our dog, for several months, day in and day out, while we were at work. We wondered if they would do the best job they were capable of, or would they cut corners? Would they stand by their work?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m happy to say that they went above and beyond our expectations, standing by us when we had a major leak that damaged a significant portion of their work. They also took excellent care of our home. Sweeten was a great resource, and knowing that they were there to assist us was valuable when going into a major renovation. I don’t think we would have had as easy of a time finding a solid and reliable contractor if we had not used Sweeten from the start.</p>
