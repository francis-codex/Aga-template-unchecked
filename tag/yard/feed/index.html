			<h3>An overview of how to start planning for your outdoor remodel</h3>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50622" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg" alt="Outdoor remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Sprucing up the out-of-doors</h3>
<p class="p1">Whether your outdoor space is seasonal or livable all year-round, having an exterior spot to relax is an upgrade in lifestyle and property value. You may be wondering how to make the most out of a rooftop deck or an urban backyard. Preparing for an outdoor remodel has many moving parts—some projects more complex than others. We break down how to begin planning and share a timeline so your green space can be ready by summertime.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>Decide on your outdoor space plan</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Santi, the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a> who transformed <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-expert-santiago/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K.V.’s backyard</a>, shared the following advice with us: “Just like any other project around the house, I recommend taking some time to decide what your goal is” for your outdoor space. Will you be using the space primarily for dining, grilling, gardening, or play? Decide what you want to prioritize: functionality or ornamentation. If there are kids involved, that will be a determining factor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Turning her attention to her brownstone’s backyard, K.V. knew she wanted to use the space to host friends and barbecues. She took inspiration from gardens in Mexico and Brazil, leaning toward a more tropical atmosphere. A tall cedar fence to provide privacy was a must-have.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31799 size-full" title="blue-floor-tiles-terrace-space" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg" alt="blue floor tiles in a terrace space with outdoor furniture and blue door after renovation" width="1000" height="649" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck-300x195.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck-600x389.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michelle and Nate remodeled <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their rooftop deck</a> to double as a &#8220;bonus room&#8221; for hanging out. It was outfitted with comfortable seating and plants to make it feel cozy. However, the rooftop felt open and exposed, so a visual barrier of plantings was placed along the perimeter. The couple also brought in a fire pit for chilly, late-summer nights.</p>
<h3>Be flexible with material choices</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">K.V. had her heart set on bluestone to create a walkway to the elevated patio in her backyard. “She had a budget she didn’t want to go over,&#8221; Santi said. &#8220;She asked us to price out bluestone, but it was a little too high, so we looked for other materials.&#8221; He added, “Homeowners should always price projects with different materials [because] changing the materials doesn’t mean changing the final goal or look of the design.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a surprise twist, they discovered bluestone buried under the dirt in the yard during demolition. K.V.&#8217;s backyard remodel paved the ground with gravel, pavers, and bluestone. While a budget might limit some choices, your contractor may be able to suggest alternative materials that fit the budget and achieve the look you want.</p>
<h3>Choosing plants for color, texture, and to enhance privacy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We asked Justin, a horticulturist at <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costa Farms</a>, to fill us in on how to choose the right plants. “The first and most important thing is to get a realistic sense of your area’s growing conditions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Consider the sun, moisture, and exposure to wind, and then pick plants that like or at least tolerate what your space has to offer.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those sunny spots, Justin recommends heat-loving tropical plants, such as hibiscus, mandevilla, and allamanda. In shady areas, birds of paradise and majesty palm are perfect for adding drama. Croton and colorful aglaonema provide a pop of color. If you choose plants that won’t survive the winter, keep them in a pot so you can bring them indoors when temperatures drop.</p>
<p>Nate and Michelle turned to landscaping to soften their space. Their landscape designer proposed lavender and feather reed grass to frame the seating area and a Japanese Maple tree. Justin also suggests other tall plants, like arborvitae, columnar juniper, and yew for privacy.</p>
<p>In K.V.’s yard, Santi filled in the spotty grass with fresh sod to transform the lawn into a thick green carpet. He also added a row of mulch along one wall for a small but manageable garden. Potted plants fill out the patio and walkway, providing color and texture.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32859 size-full" title="outdoor-plants-images" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace.jpg" alt="outdoor plants images" width="1000" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace-300x300.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />

<h3>Choose low-maintenance plants and automated irrigation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors, New Yorkers prefer outdoor spaces that are low maintenance. A landscape plan with a three-season oasis, automated irrigation in the morning, flowering shrubs during the day, and accent lights illuminating trees and fences at night would be ideal. If you find yourself unlucky in plant-love, Justin has some advice: “Coleus is a fun choice that thrives in sun or shade and has delightful, dramatically colored foliage you can enjoy from spring to frost.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Similarly, consider sweet potato vine: It spills down over the side of a planter, creating an elegant look. It also grows as a groundcover or can be trained to grow up a trellis or other structure,&#8221; Justin said. &#8220;Torenia, also called wishbone flower, is another option you can grow in sun or shade.” And if watering is your biggest concern, he advises planting mandevilla, lantana, angelonia, purslane, and evolvulus.</p>
<p class="p1">For the renovation, your landscape design should be set before demolition begins, said NYC-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5301#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Shenna</a>. “The design will determine where plumbing and electrical lines are run, as well as the rough-in for the sprinkler system,” she said. “These are laid down right after demolition.” However, there&#8217;s time with final landscaping choices. They get planted around the last month or so of the project.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>Plan your outdoor remodel in the off-season</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are looking to remodel a green space, start planning and working in the off-season. For those not ready to plant or are just building up towards a green thumb, use the warm seasons to find inspiration, and plan during winter.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a typical timeline to guide you. Pro tip: Start the process early. Use the summer months prior to gather inspiration. In the fall, begin mapping out the design, landscaping, and materials with an architect/designer/contractor. “Planning, designing, and finalizing the fine details of the project can take months,” said Shenna. This gives the contractor enough time to work with the homeowner and/or designer to get all of the pieces in place.</p>
<p class="p1">By December, permits should be submitted, your contractor hired, and materials ordered (keep delivery times in mind).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Demolition should break ground by March/April for an outdoor remodel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“The best time to physically start working on an outdoor space is in the spring.” said Shenna. “The weather makes it possible to get everything prepped and ready.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02.jpg" alt="Backyard deck area with horizontal wooden fencing and barbeque grill after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50569" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h4>Managing the outdoor remodel infrastructure</h4>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6256#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor</span></a> Mike, who is based in NYC said, “The scope of the project, the square footage of the outdoor space, and material delays” will affect how much time goes into the planning phase in advance. Depending on the complexity of the project, an outdoor remodel typically takes two months to finish. However, an outdoor kitchen that requires plumbing, gas, and electrical could take longer for approvals than a deck remodel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an outdoor space, there’s a lot more to consider, like drainage. Your general contractor should have an in-depth understanding of how bulk water will be managed and how your plans will impact the neighbors. If you’re working on a roof, make sure you have access points for clearing roof drains.</p>
<h4>Organizing material delivery and approvals</h4>
<p class="p1">Your team will also have to haul all of the materials to your outdoor space. Hauling roof deck lumber, soil, sod, and plant matter up through service elevators can be costly and time-consuming. An alternative is booming materials to the roof by crane. Contractors usually have partnerships with local greenhouses and lumber yards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>They can move materials from the street to a garden more efficiently and cost-effectively than using a service elevator.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, make sure you have the necessary approvals. Most exterior improvements will require an alteration agreement and approval from the building&#8217;s architect, and many will require filing with the city. If you live in a landmarked building, special regulations will apply.</p>
<p class="p1">Start and plan early with the right professionals onboard. A well-planned deck or garden can greatly increase the value of a property. It will be time and money well-spent.

<p class="p1">Enjoy a change of scenery in your own home. Outdoor spaces present an increase in living space and an upgrade to lifestyle. However, not all backyards are ready for “prime time” and a remodel is in order. NYC landscaping costs for the backyard include scope, flooring, demolition, fencing, electrical, and structures.</p>
<p class="p1">Fortunately, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every outdoor space can be improved</a> substantially with some great ideas and expert help. Our guide will help you understand the most common elements to consider in NYC with some tips from our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors. </p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Building an outdoor space: where to start</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Outdoor space runs the gamut from a simple patio to a full outdoor kitchen. What you can achieve at your home is going to be limited by three main factors: space available, your budget, and building codes. Of those three factors, codes might be the most perplexing—and least flexible.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For the most part, building codes exist for safety and you can either comply or change the design. They’re not that onerous for most outdoor projects, but you might face challenges from setbacks, for example. That means you can’t build right up to the property line in certain cases. Once you <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choose a NYC contractor</a> to work with, your GC will be invaluable in guiding you through design decisions that meet your desires <i>and</i> codes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Space available and budget are easier to grasp. When your contractor gives you a good idea of the buildable space and rough estimates for your “must-haves” and optional features, you can get going on your plan. Do a deep dive and check out projects that appeal to you. Creating a photo montage of completed projects that get you all frothy is a fun way to design!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg" alt="Backyard with stained cedar fencing along with white chairs and lawn grass after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50617" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) General contractor Santiago renovated this <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backyard space</a> for Sweeten homeowner KV Harper</p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Backyard landscaping cost: Outdoor flooring </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Knowing how you want to use your space is the first step to setting the budget. The outdoor-room concept is multi-faceted. Some people don’t want much besides a table for meals, others want to sunbathe, some want a spa, and the cooks want a full kitchen. Whatever your wants, you’ll have to start at the bottom: what you walk on. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you have an existing patio or roof to use, great, then you can move on to other elements. If your space does need some help with the flooring, though, you’ll find a host of possibilities. One of the most popular options, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Santiago</a> in New York, is bluestone patios. This material is durable and beautiful, if fairly expensive. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Bluestone pavers cost</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bluestone is a natural stone paver that offers beauty, durability, and flexibility. Cut bluestone pavers will cost from around $8/square foot for 1” thick stone and is available in many sizes. Smaller stones of about 12” square will give you a slightly different aesthetic than huge slabs, and are definitely easier to work with. Access can be a challenge in the city, and you might have to spring for a crane if you want large, heavy stones. There’s just no other way to move them in tight spaces. This process will cost you at least $2,000, not including the stone and site preparation. Smaller sizes are more manageable, though, and can be hauled by hand if necessary.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Concrete pavers cost</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To spend less, “Concrete pavers are available in dozens of size and color options for $4–5/square foot,” Santiago said. In addition, they don’t need a crane for installation. Installation for both concrete and stone pavers will be the same, with costs varying depending on the current base rather than the material you choose. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Calculating your backyard landscaping costs</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/nyc-landscaping-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Determining your </span><span class="s2">backyard landscaping costs</span></a><span class="s1"> are also determined by demolition work. That type of work will vary by what you have in place now, so contractors don’t want to guess on costs. Do you have an existing patio that must be removed? Or grass? How good is the access? Are you working on the ground floor or higher up? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There are so many variables that rough estimates without seeing the site aren’t possible, our contractors said. They need to see what’s there first and learn what you want before they can give an estimate. </span>Post your project on Sweeten to discuss the possibilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="s1">“I have to look at the job; two jobs are never alike. Labor is not easy to price. There are a lot of elements factoring in,” Santiago noted.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">NYC-based Sweeten general contractor Steve concurred, saying that there are backyard remodeling jobs where all materials have to come in and out through the front door. “A lot of the time you have to take the garbage out through the first floor, out the basement, or out the window. Everything has to be protected.”</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition to patios, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decks are popular</a> and sometimes do not require demolition and hauling out old materials. Decks can offer great flexibility in fitting into existing spaces, and they can also be particularly budget-friendly by overlaying an existing shabby concrete slab, saving the cost and hassle of demolition and removal.</span></p>
<h3>When to start planning your outdoor space</h3>
<p><span>Enjoy your green space for the summer by starting the process early. Use the summer months prior to gather inspiration. In the Fall, begin planning with an architect/designer/contractor on design, landscaping, and materials. By December submit permits, hire your contractor, and order materials (keep delivery times in mind). Demolition should break ground by March/April. Depending on the complexity of the project, an outdoor remodel typically takes two months to finish. Although an outdoor kitchen requiring plumbing, gas, and electrical could take longer for approvals vs a deck remodel.</span><span> </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Creating fencing and perimeter walls</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Fences and walls, too, are basic elements of most projects, and serve several functions. Privacy is usually a main concern, but view control and wind control are also important. Most people opt for wood fences, said Steve. As for design elements, “People in general want big wide planks; materials that are more architectural looking, with bright backgrounds,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“It depends on each client. Some people want a lot of space for seating. For all intents and purposes it’s an outside living room,” he noted. Fences offer a lot of design freedom, as well, including horizontal and vertical elements, natural wood tones or painted surfaces, and using wood, stone, and/or metal. “Most people do wood fencing,” Sweeten contractor Santiago said, “some choose pressure-treated, while others opt for cedar. It depends on the budget.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Outdoor lighting </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some details, such as lighting, are easy to overlook at first. It’s a major element in both ambiance and useability, however, and should be tackled at the design stage rather than tacked on later.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Everyone is into lighting,” Santiago said. “For this, you&#8217;ll need to factor in outlets. Floodlights can accent the plants. They can be simple but very cool.” Lighting and electrical are simple and easy compared to some other elements, but they require planning for running buried lines and removing overhead lines. When your contractor has a design for you, then it’s time to consider the lighting based on function. Lighting in the dining area is different from lighting for walkways and for plants. It’s all part of the design process.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Adding pergolas and arbors</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As another distinct element, pergolas and arbors provide shade, structure, and beauty to your outdoor room, as well as an often-needed vertical feature. Arbors are simple and small structures that often frame a pathway, while pergolas are larger and more substantial, sometimes attached to the house. You might train vines or climbing roses on the arbor, for example. Pergolas can use a slatted, cloth, or solid roofing material, making them flexible so you have both sun and shelter in your yard.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Landscaping front yard</span><span class="s3"> options</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In New York City, front yard spaces aren’t as common, but you can still add natural beauty. In addition to using fine materials for your front entry, steps, and railing, do you have room for planters? If you like plants, this is a great option for tight spaces and lets you add some color and texture. If live plants are too much work or tough to keep alive, planters can also house durable and seasonal items like spruce tops. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You can see a multitude of high-quality planters and pots online, and talk with your contractor about building some that fit your space exactly. Many people choose cedar for this project, as it’s beautiful and relatively rot-resistant. Other woods work fine, too, and can look great finished in paint or stain. Add your ideas to your photo montage and discuss with your renovation team.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Landscaping costs</span><span class="s1"> for homes in New York City can be tough to estimate without a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit from several firms</a>. </span><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your home or outdoor remodel, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with the right local contractor</a> to get you to your dream space. </span></p>

A general contractor will need to view the site and walk through your wish list before an estimate can be given. If you’re building from scratch, popular flooring includes bluestone pavers ($8/square foot) or concrete ($4-$5/square foot). Other costs depend on the nature of the demolition required and if any perimeter fencing or structures, like pergolas, will be installed. Costs will increase if outdoor lighting requires running buried electrical lines. The contractor uses these factors and more to determine labor costs.</p></div>
