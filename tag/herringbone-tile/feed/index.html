<h3>Remodeling an outdated 80&#8217;s West Village kitchen</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36013 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-36010 size-full" title="jonathan-standing-in-kitchen-with-wife" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01.jpg" alt="jonathan standing in his kitchen with his wife in front of white kitchen cabinets and herringbone pattern subway tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<div></div>
<p>Though Erin and Jonathan’s West Village kitchen in their 750-square-foot apartment was, for the most part, functional, it didn’t suit their style. Another downside: the kitchen did not make the best use of the available space. Open to the living area, there was plenty of room to add the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in island</a> on the couple’s wish list, plus reimagine the layout. Ready to bid farewell to the ‘80s cabinetry and shabby tile flooring, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project to Sweeten</a> and were matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a general contractor</a>.</p>
<h3>Picking renovation materials and kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36018 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="waterfall-marble-island-with-pendant-lights"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floor and waterfall marble island with pendant lights and white walls after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36013 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36018 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-36018 size-full" title="waterfall-kitchen-island-with-cabinet-drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floor and waterfall marble island with pull out drawers inside cabinets and pendant lights after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The basic kitchen transformed into a bright, modern marvel complete with new stainless steel appliances, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/sleek-waterfall-island-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall island</a>, and light fixtures. The overall contemporary culinary space also got some more classic updates, like the Shaker-style cabinets and herringbone tile backsplash. To connect the kitchen with the rest of the living area, 5-inch white oak flooring was installed throughout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A French door refrigerator replaced the older model, while the new dishwasher (that has a window and lights up!) moved to the stove&#8217;s previous location. A stainless steel hood and gas range found a new central location in the space across from the storage-packed island.</p>
<h3>Working through the renovation process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor brought the couple’s vision to life, ensuring everything was on time and on budget. “The contractor’s app was also a very helpful tool for us to make material selections and track the progress of the project,” Jonathan said. Their contractor provided valuable input, guiding them on sourcing materials, layout, and space considerations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The entire process was intimidating. From planning, scheduling, prepping, and deciding, it was all new to us. Sweeten and our contractors made us feel at ease,” he continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation had its challenges (the couple moved into a sublet for three months), but it wrapped up beautifully. “Before, there was a daily struggle for space and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>. Getting a certain level of cleanliness was never attainable in an older apartment. Now when we walk in the door, it’s a breath of fresh air,” Jonathan said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: The countertops are actually marble-like quartz that doesn’t just look pretty; it’s very durable too!</p>

<h3>A homecoming for Americans abroad</h3>
<p class="p2">Before the word “Covid” entered our collective consciousness, Andrew and I lived as American expats in Hong Kong. As educators, we worked long and active terms, which were often fulfilling, but sometimes thankless. We cherished our long breaks.</p>
<p class="p2">In our first few years together, we traveled all over Asia and Europe. However, we knew at some point we would settle back home in California, close to family, both given and chosen.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50465 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cory-Portrait-05.jpeg" alt="Image of LA homeowners who used Sweeten" width="1536" height="1152" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cory-Portrait-05.jpeg 1536w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cory-Portrait-05-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cory-Portrait-05-600x450.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><span class="img-label"><em>(</em></span><span class="img-label"><em>Above)</em> Family portrait courtesy of Sweeten homeowners</span></span></p>
<h3>Purchasing the right-size bungalow home</h3>
<p class="p2">2018 was our year. After I returned from a visiting professor role in the South of France, Andrew and I married in the south of California. Right after we said “I do,” we started looking for a home, for living in when we visited Los Angeles, and for renting out the rest of the year. Our goal was to find a modest, move-in-ready house in a central location, with a spectacular view.</p>

<p>We soon discovered, though, that the supply in the market meeting both our needs and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our budget</a> was greatly limited. Eventually, we chose the hillside of Glassell Park. Our 650-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bathroom bungalow was still nearly double the size of our apartment in Hong Kong. It was more space than we&#8217;d had in a long time, and we knew that it would be the perfect place to welcome us back to this side of the Pacific. Best of all, our southwest-facing view meant we could watch the sun rise and set without moving from our perch.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Working from home during Covid</h3>
<p class="p1">Then Covid happened. In the summer of 2020, we left Hong Kong, our cat Velcro in tow. Moving during a pandemic was not easy, but a larger space and the LA weather made <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working from home</a> more manageable. We decided to enjoy actually living in our home before renovating. When the time was right, we started with the bathroom, and then added something special for our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor space</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">The total renovation time, from when our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor began demolition to painting, took about six weeks. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small bathroom</a> was the biggest challenge. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wanted a space</a> that was updated, but timeless. Which meant everything had to go!</p>
<h3>Inspired by a classic bright blue</h3>
<p class="p1">We’re not afraid of color but prefer to inject it as an accent. I chose black-and-white as the base with 3” x 6” white subway tile. (It reminded us of our years in New York). To add some whimsy, we decided to mix geometric shapes—herringbone in the shower and a brick layout for the rest of the bathroom. <span style="color: #333333;">The tile installer ended up laying the herringbone horizontally instead of the classic vertical configuration, but this added to the quirkiness we had envisioned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-05.jpg" alt="Yves Klein blue bathroom remodel in los angeles" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50458" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/74938-Cory-BathOD-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/renovators-converted-tubs-to-showers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathtub was removed and replaced</a> with a freestanding shower. Andrew is 6’3”, and was thrilled when he discovered the ceiling could be moved up by a foot, allowing the showerhead to be mounted several inches above his red curls. For the shower floor, I chose a simple porcelain penny tile, trying to match one of my favorite hues: Yves Klein blue. To tie this rich color back to the rest of the bathroom, we painted the walls with custom-matched semi-gloss paint.</p>
<h3>Making a small space feel open</h3>
<p class="p1">I sourced all of the bathroom components myself. The pre-fabricated glass shower door plays with the geometric theme using varying sizes of rectangles. Its frosted glass helps to diffuse the light while providing a modest cover. I carried this into the blocky console sink with exposed legs. Above it, the round vanity mirror with a medicine cabinet ties back to the round penny tiles. Due to the small size of the bathroom, it was important to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open it up</a> as much as possible. So we avoided closed cabinets. This also forced us to be more mindful of our clutter.</p>

<p class="p1">For the most part, I was conscious of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not over-spending</a> on the decorative components. We did splurge with the pieces for the sink and shower. And with the pièce de résistance: a Japanese-style toilet and bidet with seat warmer, air dryer, and warm water setting. Andrew doubted the necessity of this but now can’t imagine life without it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;The tile installer ended up laying the herringbone horizontally instead of the classic vertical configuration, but it only added to the quirkiness we had envisioned.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The finishing touch was the porcelain basketweave floor tiles in black and white. I thought this would be a nice way to ground the complexity of the rigid and organic shapes with one last element.</p>

<h3 class="p1">Bringing the deck inside</h3>
<p class="p1">When we’re home, we find the most joy <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watching the sunset from our deck</a> that looks over the neighborhood. Our goal was to bring that view into the home itself, so we decided to replace the two living room windows with a set of pre-hung French doors. The best feature of the doors is that the blinds are set between two panes of glass, making it ideal for thwarting a mischievous, climbing cat. Velcro loves to play! Now all three of us can lie on our rugs and pillows on the floor, watching the sunbeams stream into our home. We even got a retractable screen door so that Velcro, too, can enjoy the fresh air from inside.</p>
<p class="p1">We’re very happy with <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the progress we’ve made</a> on the home so far. It <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feels more like ours</a> every day! That being said, we’re still not done. Next project: <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen redo</a>! As a home chef, this is my most sacred space. Stay tuned for more!</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Cory and Andrew, for sharing your hillside home with us!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A growing family prompts a layout change: adding a second bath and bedroom</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-23211 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Jeanne_Apartment-09.jpg" alt="adding a second bath with blue tile" width="1000" height="700" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Jeanne_Apartment-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Jeanne_Apartment-09-723x506.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Jeanne_Apartment-09-300x210.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Jeanne_Apartment-09-600x420.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> “After&#8221; photos by Pixy Interiors for Sweeten</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span class="s2">: Transform a one-bedroom unit by splitting the master bath into two; adding a second bathroom and an extra bedroom. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span class="s2">: When Jeanne and Philip found out they were having a baby, it was just the incentive they needed to renovate. Changing the layout of their 1,000-square-foot apartment would be more efficient for their growing family. They wanted more space to enjoy while raising their little one</span><span class="s2">—without being on top of one another. Luckily, with the help of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, <span class="s1">a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> and found a contractor who could help fulfill their vision of adding a second bathroom and bedroom by splitting up the master bath. </span></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44795 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeanne-bathroom-before-01.jpg" alt="before pictures of the bathroom " width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeanne-bathroom-before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeanne-bathroom-before-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeanne-bathroom-before-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>They discussed turning their one-bedroom into a two-bedroom and splitting their master bath into two with their contractor. Luckily, there was enough square footage to play with. The previous owner had taken a closet next to the master bathroom to make a large walk-in shower. The couple&#8217;s Sweeten contractor would use some of that space to make a guest bath and second bedroom.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span class="s2">: The couple decided a design-build firm would be a good fit since maximizing their apartment&#8217;s limited space would be tricky. Plus, the contractor handled the</span> architectural documents required by the co-op board and filed for city permits. The family&#8217;s main goal was to turn the guest bath into an ADA-compliant space. To do so, they had to add a step up due to underlying drains. Without it, the room would not be able to function in such a capacity. An ADA-compliant space follows a federal guideline to provide greater <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">access to people with limited mobility</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When shopping for Manhattan real estate, you don’t always get what you want. For Gall, a patent attorney who grew up in Florida, an extended search for a new Manhattan apartment took him and his wife first across town, into an unexpected neighborhood, and subsequently through an impressive renovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23270 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-723x487.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="487" /></a><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gall was living in a Hell’s Kitchen one-bedroom with his wife Ingrid, a Brazilian-born speech pathologist. They initially discovered <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> when they began thinking about a renovation for that apartment. The makeover wasn’t to be, however, and they switched gears in anticipation of expanding their family. For the better part of a year, the couple shopped for a larger apartment in the competitive market along Broadway on the Upper West Side. It was only after widening their search across Central Park that they stumbled onto an affordable Upper East Side building “right on top of the subway,” he notes.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high-rise building was originally developed as a rental in the 1980’s, and Gall liked the way its bay windows amplified the view. The 1,280-square-foot unit had received mainly cosmetic renovations since going condo in the early 2000’s, so floors were a deep brown that showed dust and failed to bounce natural light around the space. The original kitchen measured 100 square feet, but felt cramped and closed-off, with a shortage of counter space. Gall, who is the family chef, recalls the well-used beige plastic laminate kitchen cabinets as being very small, and they didn’t go all the way to the ceiling. There was also insufficient storage in the bedrooms. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where they fit their clothes,&#8221; he says.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23381 size-chrono" title="Upper East Side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23272 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, it was a real estate broker’s recommendation which reminded Gall of Sweeten. He <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their remodel</a>, along with a wish list of some elements to add and others to subtract. After signing with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> that offered design and build services in April, demolition began in June. Their contractor worked with the couple for months, strategically updating the apartment while enhancing the expanses of space that had attracted them in the first place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One early target was a wide bank of awkwardly placed bui</span>lt-in bookcases ri<span style="font-weight: 400;">ght at the entrance. “It had tons of little compartments and really felt cluttered right there in the middle of the house,” Gall explains. They removed it and worked with their team to fill the same space with closed storage. A penthouse they saw while apartment shopping served as the couple’s design inspiration for cool mirror doors—on both their new pantry cabinet and the neighboring linen closet—that are decorated with a retro raised-panel design.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One unexpected (and technically challenging) concern was mentioned by the building architect. For the spot where they planned to open up the kitchen by demolishing a wall, the architect asked about a much discussed but often ignored code requirement for a drop soffit to channel smoke dividing the ceiling between the kitchen and living area. A reworked soffit satisfied the requirement and tied into the other new ones around the living room. To unify the apartment throughout, their contractor suggested </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they see an example of 5-inch-wide white oak floors in another project the team had completed; Gall and Ingrid instantly fell in love. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wood was glued down to the concrete subfloor throughout the living areas, and even in the kitchen. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23382 size-chrono" title="Upper East Side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23276 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23277 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span>he new kitchen has synthetic quartz for the countertops, as well as on the new island where the wall<span style="font-weight: 400;"> once stood. “By opening up the wall we lost a lot of upper cabinet space,” he explains, which made new full-height cabinets a necessity. The cabinets are white-painted maple, and the backsplash mosaic is a herringbone composed of glass and marble tiles. The couple skipped a range in favor of the flexibility of having a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-ovens-power-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall oven</a> and separate <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooktop</a>. The refrigerator, though not a pricey panel-ready model, is neatly integrated into a tall wall of white cabinetry. The cookspace was one of their favorite spaces. &#8220;The craftsmanship was amazing,&#8221; said Gall. &#8220;The huge countertop makes working in the kitchen a pleasant experience,&#8221; including enough space for him and his wife to cook together.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23278 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23279 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In t</span>he master bathroom, <span style="font-weight: 400;">a tub was replaced with a new stand-up shower with marble from Porcelanosa. Gall praises the three-dimensional renderings created by his Sweeten contractor, which were a great help for imagining the look of the kitchen. “We’re not visual people, and that made the process much smoother and easier.” </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23282 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14.gif 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14-300x200.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23281 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-12" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23280 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1.gif 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1-300x200.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The closet organization in the master bedroom was built to the homeowners&#8217; exact requests, not only providing more than adequate storage, but the cabinet doors matched the rest found in the apartment. For the nursery, the initial placement allowed the rest of the room to be furnished around it. &#8220;The closet was planned to accommodate two children at different ages,&#8221; says Gall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23350 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Upper east side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1-723x1058.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1058" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of the inconveniences, Sweeten clearly contributed immeasurably to the couple’s renovation. “We had been very nervous about getting the right contractor, one who wouldn’t walk out on us,” he recalls. He advises renovators to expect a longer period of construction than originally quoted, and to spend as much of your own energy on it as possible. Once you find an expert you can count on, he says, &#8220;trust your contractor&#8217;s opinion.&#8221; Mid-construction, they found out they were expecting a child, and the job was finished before the birth. Today, one of those spectacular bay windows in the living room, with its classic New York view, makes an ideal playpen for the luckiest of big-city babies.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When they began looking for more space, Chelsea residents Lauren and Ross didn’t want to move far from their Manhattan neighborhood. Luckily, they found a new home in Kensington House, an Art Deco co-op building just three blocks from their old place. The two-bed, two-bath apartment featured plentiful space for entertaining—a must for Lauren, a food industry professional, as well as the perfect nook for Ross’ piano. The baths in this Emory Roth-designed building were true to their 1930s roots, with out-of-style tiling, industrial flushometer toilets, and exposed radiator pipes that were an unattractive hazard. The couple tapped the interior design firm White Arrow to create hotel-inspired baths with more storage. Read also about their choice for color and a unique, space-saving pocket door solution.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband, Ross, and I purchased a two-bedroom apartment in Chelsea last year. We were already living in a one-bedroom apartment in the same neighborhood and wanted to upgrade to an apartment that had more space. After about three months of looking, we found the perfect apartment, only three blocks from where we were living.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the loft-style layout of the apartment we found, but the bathrooms were in a bit of a sorry state. The tile was outdated and one of the baths had a huge old-school metal tub stopper located next to the toilet. So we planned on gutting the two spaces along with a few extra upgrades, such as replacing the kitchen’s backsplash and lighting, sanding the floors, repainting the apartment, removing a desk in the study to accommodate a piano, and turning a less-than-ideal barn door in the dining foyer into a more discreet pocket door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We hired <a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Arrow</a>, a friend’s sister’s design company to assist us with the design process, and they, in turn, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our contractor</a>. Our Sweeten contractor was also very helpful throughout the design process and suggested modifications and tweaks to the original design that best fit our needs.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">Creating a wide barn pocket door proved to be a challenge but &#8220;our contractor suggested we attach three store-bought doors together&#8230;&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We initially budgeted two to three months for the renovation process, and typical for New York, ended up taking about four months. The apartment’s previous tenants took all of their light fixtures with them when they moved out, so we purchased new light fixtures for all of the rooms. I created a Pinterest board to help refine my ideas. We especially love the distinctive CB2 chandelier which hangs above our dining room table.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being a food writer and having written <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Kitchens-Behind-Burner-Hanoi/dp/B00AK2TMOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four Kitchens</a></em>, a book about working in restaurants around the world, it was important for me to have a clean, streamlined kitchen for cooking and entertaining. We loved the custom cabinets that were already in place but wanted to update the backsplash by installing white subway tiles to replace the existing small red-and-brown multicolored ones. We also swapped out the sink faucet for a contemporary Grohe fixture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ross loves playing piano, and with this apartment, we were finally able to accommodate a piano in our space. We removed a wooden plank which the previous owners had used as a desk and created a nook which was a perfect spot for an upright piano.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Creating the pocket door separating the dining area from the bedroom proved a bit of a challenge at first, but our contractor helpfully suggested that we attach three store-bought doors together, and then build a fake wall over what used to be the space for the barn door. This would be a more affordable solution than purchasing a custom wood door, which he noted would be very expensive. We then painted the door and surrounding walls Hamilton Blue by Benjamin Moore, a color we had in our old apartment, and one that we knew looked good as a backdrop for our artwork. Also in the dining area, we covered a pipe that had previously been exposed. We had initially wanted to get rid of it since it was in the middle of the walkway, but this was not possible. Our unit was originally two apartments that had been combined at some point in the past, and the pipe had been inside the dividing walls.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathrooms probably required the most work. Our designers initially suggested moving around the placement of the sink and toilet to maximize space, but this was going to require additional permits and more time. As such, we ended up leaving the tubs, sinks, and toilets in the same places, and just upgraded with new fixtures. I love taking baths so we got deep-soaking tubs for both bathrooms, as well as <a href="https://www.totousa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toto toilets</a>. For the master bath, I was inspired by the clean, elegant look of hotel bathrooms and wanted marble walls to be a focus of that space. We opted for a glass panel on the tub, which our contractor sourced for us. We also covered unattractive heating pipes with grates from <a href="https://www.archgrille.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Grille</a>. Custom shelving was added in the form of a shower niche, as well as a large in-wall cabinet opposite the sink.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the guest bath, a simple white tile with black grout was chosen to complement the Coyuchi shower curtain and an Of a Kind planter we had brought from our previous bathroom. We ran into some issues with the tiles purchased by our designers for the guest bath, so our contractor made suggestions that helped the material work in the space. Contemporary <a href="https://www.graff-designs.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graff shower fixtures</a> were selected for both showers. As for the color palette, we chose white because it was a neutral color, and it is just very soothing to have a white bathroom. Both looks are timeless, and we figured they would be appealing to us now and hopefully to anyone who bought the apartment later on.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the four months of work, we were able to move into our new space, which we now love. We tried to create a contemporary space that reflects our personal tastes while adding elements which also capture the Art Deco heritage of our apartment building.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two newlyweds came to Sweeten for help finding a general contractor with design expertise to update and brighten their two-bedroom co-op on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. Read on down to see a classically sweetened kitchen, master bath, and powder room!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/white-walls-and-black-hardware-in-a-windowed-pre-war-kitchen/"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20220" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advantages of this couple&#8217;s new place were very clear: beamed ceilings and big windows in every room brought lovely natural light throughout the unit, and original hardwood floors lent a relaxed look to the space. The kitchen, visible from the foyer, dining room, and living room, had two gracious windows but was outfitted with miniature appliances, isolated blocks of cabinets, and dark finishes. And while the kitchen and both bathrooms had been treated to some relatively recent updates, this couple saw potential for modern features and additions that would help them get settled. With the closing officially on the books, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple posted their project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten, calling for a designer and builder who could help them make the most of the square footage in the kitchen and bathrooms before moving in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>matched them with a Sweeten design-build firm</strong></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Together, they devised a plan to create a more spacious and bright kitchen and newly updated baths with elegant finishes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18737"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18737 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" alt="sweeten_mila_kitchen-before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-Before-01-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contractors began with the kitchen, gutting the space entirely. The apartment’s oak floors were worn, but the telltale parquet plank details and inlaid borders were enough to convince the team to leave them in place, restore them, and extend them into the kitchen, replacing the section of pine flooring that had made its way in during a previous renovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This design-build firm specializes in custom millwork and brought a signature white shaker look to this couple’s kitchen. They went minimal in the most visible places, limiting full cabinet lines to one wall, adding a bit of open shelving to the windowed wall, and significantly extending base cabinets around the back wall of the dining nook. These design decisions aimed for maximum light and an open feel. They tore out the windowsill just to the left of the dining nook to make way for that additional counter and cabinet space, and finished the full set with contrasting black knobs and sturdy pulls. The old black stone counters were replaced with white and soft gray quartz, blending the new white and black combo seamlessly.</p>

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18728"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18728" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-1.jpg" alt="all-white kitchen renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18746" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="custom built-in shelf" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowners were keen on replacing their compact oven and dishwasher with full-size versions, so the pair gained a sleek new Verona gas range with an exhaust hood fashioned with custom oak shelves on either side, stained to match the new floors. A full size Bosch dishwasher took the place of the old, just to the left of the stove and concealed behind coordinating cabinetry panels. The couple chose a large white Kohler farmhouse sink and chrome Moen faucet, situated nicely under the far window. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new stainless steel double-door fridge is now flanked by custom pantry storage, and the Sweeten contractor pulled the entire update together with a simple beveled white marble backsplash.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-06-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18730"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18730 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-06-1.jpg" alt="kohler farmhouse sink" width="600" height="903" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-06-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-06-1-199x300.jpg 199w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-06-1-598x900.jpg 598w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like the kitchen, the homeowners wanted cosmetic changes to both bathrooms to reveal more of their personal style and taste, favoring neutral colors and patterns and aiming for a brighter, cleaner feel. Nothing too extravagant, too old, or too contemporary. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They decided on simple geometric shapes and a natural palette in both. The master bath received a full gut without changing the footprint. Cloudy square floor tiles were tossed and delicate carrara marble pieces in soft bluish grays went down. The old shower/tub combo was of average height and size and contained very basic hardware. The couple chose a deep cast-iron Soissons Kohler bath with multiple Rohl hardware fixtures in a gorgeous muted polished nickel. A dark wood vanity sink originally stood to the left of the tub but was replaced with a much lighter wood finish with twice the storage space. A chic square mirror with an antiqued bevel stands over it, and new Kohler toilets were added in both bathrooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the powder room, the same cloudy square floor tiles were replaced with a herringbone tile in soft gray and white, while the same square wall tiles were swapped for a subway style in white marble. The homeowners selected a slender dark wood vanity and square white porcelain sink, along with a silhouette mirror trimmed in wood to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The general contractors sanded and stained the oak wood floors throughout the rest of the apartment, and in doing so they replaced all of the white shoe molding as well. The walls were stripped and repainted, mostly white or the palest gray-blue found in the new powder room.</p>
