			<h2>Expecting parents take on a 3-story, daunting Sunset Park renovation</h2>
<p><em>For a decade, AJ and Ray lived in a 450-square-foot studio apartment in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. In search of more space, they traveled a few stops south on the subway and landed a 3-floor, 2-family brick row house just across the street from the neighborhood&#8217;s park, offering views of New York Harbor and Manhattan. The home measured a whopping 2,964 square feet—not an unusual size for a townhouse, but much larger than what they were used to. After three years of test-driving their new space, they opened up rooms and improved the flow from front to back</em><em>&#8230;</em><em>while expecting a baby. Here&#8217;s how AJ and Ray used <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, to do a gut renovation in Sunset Park and turn a nondescript house into an open oasis for their family of three.</em></p>

Guest post by Sunset Park homeowner Ray</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We bought the house to renovate but lived in it for three years as we planned for the renovation. The place had been poorly maintained as a rental for many years (drop ceilings, temporary walls, very old roof, the works). It needed to be updated and modernized. The property was set up as a two-story, two-family house. There was an apartment on each floor—one bath, one bedroom, a kitchen and a living room. New kitchens and bathrooms don’t come cheap, and the renovation seemed daunting.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We had lived in a small studio and were used to an open floor plan. When we moved into the new house, it was small and blocked off from all of the other rooms. It made it difficult to chat and hang out with each other. We weren&#8217;t used to the feeling of being separated. Figuring out the best layout, style, and finishes were left to AJ and Robin Rathmann-Noonan, her sister and an interior designer at <a href="https://www.robinr-n.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RobinR-N</a>. We were interested in an open entertaining space on the first floor with three bedrooms on the second floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were hoping that our renovation would be fast and straightforward. It was certainly not straightforward! Although the interior was designed and planned by Robin, we had to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/when-do-you-need-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire an architect</a> and expeditor to draw and file the plans. We interviewed at least eight contractors, but the one we initially selected, and who filed the plans with the city, had underbid and sent us a contract that was overpriced. After going back and forth, we ultimately abandoned him and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1458" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our design-build firm on Sweeten</a> after <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7877" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posting our project</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Robin and AJ worked together to create a cohesive aesthetic for the house. In the kitchen, they looked to capture the light streaming through the back windows, and keeping the space as light and fresh as possible. &#8220;With the beautiful southern light at the back of the house and the openness of the view to the backyard, it made sense to relocate the kitchen there and open the rest of the house up to that space,” said Robin.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-32.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31423 size-chrono" title="stairwell" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-32-723x1085.jpg" alt="townhouse renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-31.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31422 size-chrono" title="door-at-entrance-inside-outside" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-31.gif" alt="door at the entrance from inside and outside after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />

On mini-splits: Ray had a hard time saying goodbye to the NYC radiators he had spent his entire life around. It was always too cold or too hot—and he LOVED it, says AJ.
</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The entry hall corridor leads directly to the kitchen. The lightness of the kitchen helped connect the spaces visually from the front to the back of the home. &#8220;The dark floors and kitchen table and chairs made a nice contrast to white cabinets and the light Caesarstone countertops,&#8221; says Robin. The kitchen island was a main feature of the space. From a recommendation from AJ and Robin’s mom, it housed the sink and an open built-in shelving area at one end for cookbooks and some baby items, making use of every inch of space!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“The space was designed to accommodate the way they live,&#8221; explained Robin. &#8220;If someone is cooking or the baby is playing, the family and guests can congregate on the ground floor and still feel connected even if they are in different rooms.” For lighting, they kept the ceilings minimalist, choosing surface-mount fixtures and pendants as a design focus.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of layout, we had two options for a third bedroom: it could go in the front of the house with a window, or in between the two other bedrooms where it currently sits. After working on the drawings, Robin determined that we could get more space using the space adjacent to the front bedroom than the space that is now a bathroom. According to the Department of Buildings code, we needed light and an egress to make sure that it could be called a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-is-a-legal-bedroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal bedroom</a>. In order to accomplish this, we needed to put a skylight into the middle bedroom as part of the roof update. It seemed odd at the time, but in the end, the room ended up being perfect for the baby, who we were already expecting when the renovation began.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-During-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31573 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-During-2-723x482.jpg" alt="townhouse renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, although we wanted air conditioning in the house, central air was a huge financial commitment. Mini-splits were suggested, but our past landlords had put a unit in our old apartment near the end of our time there, which we liked functionally but not aesthetically. After much back and forth, we decided on a ducted mini-split system so that the air-handling units were hidden in the ceilings; we only lost a little height in the first-floor hallway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31432 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-19-723x482.jpg" alt="townhouse renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31434 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="townhouse renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was an enormous undertaking for us, and as much of a rush that we were in with a baby on the way, we appreciated that our Sweeten contractor slowed us down and walked through the entire process with us, down to the details of the toilet paper holder. Our renovation was a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/truth-design-build-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design-build</a> job and our Sweeten contractor had all the details of what needed to be done written down on paper for our review. We appreciated the attention to detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best advice we can give is to ask questions even when things get technical and you are in over your head. And be patient! Our main questions were: Can we afford this? What is the payment schedule? Can we finish the house before the baby arrives? What is your timeline?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were most excited about having space, a real kitchen and closets, which was a huge change from where we were living before. When we worked on the interior layout, it seemed like we had planned for an extreme amount of storage space, but wouldn’t you know, we’ve managed to use it all!</p>
<p>We are so glad that we found our Sweeten contractor—we couldn’t have been happier (or luckier!).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A flexible, sunny space makes a happy home—and a good investment</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30365 mb-0 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>It was brimming with potential: a corner, prewar loft on a main street in Greenwich Village. The apartment took full advantage of its southern and western exposures with oversized, industrial windows that wrapped around two sides of the loft. Much of the space was open-plan with 14-foot-high ceilings; a mezzanine above the kitchen is accessible via a charming spiral staircase and can be used as a guest bedroom or home office.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30366 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before02-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft21.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30417 mb-0 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft21-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>The homeowner saw an opportunity to add value to the apartment by taking advantage of its structural beauty and abundant natural light. The building was converted in the late &#8217;70s from an industrial manufacturing space into residences and the unit had been relatively untouched since. Parquet wood tiles and warped cork would be replaced, and the decades-old kitchen and bath desperately needed a makeover. A few tweaks to the layout would also maximize the space to its full potential as an investment and a primary residence. He decided to go for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30368 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft11-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft15-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30406 mb-0 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft15-1-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After purchasing the co-op apartment, the homeowner lived in it for six months before renovating. Modern finishes would be a more suitable backdrop to the gorgeous natural light that poured through the six oversized 10-foot windows. He also decided to use pocket and barn doors for a seamless look and flexible use of spaces. Enter <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors. The homeowner <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/18338" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted his project</a> and was matched with a Sweeten design-build firm, and they got to work to fulfill the vision.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30370 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before01-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30373 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, they ripped out the kitchen’s outdated Formica counters and &#8217;70s-era cabinets, and completely gutted the old bathroom. The kitchen ceiling was cut away from the windows by about 18 inches to make more of the windows visible. An entryway closet was reduced so that the view from the kitchen window could be seen from the entrance of the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The floor on the mezzanine was also pulled back from the window and outfitted with a railing along its edge. The hardwood was repainted; the ceiling was scraped and painted, setting the stage for a guest bedroom, office, and additional closet storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30371 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft02-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30372 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft04-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen’s standout feature is the Carrara marble backsplash and 2-inch-thick countertops with a waterfall edge. Ikea cabinets with blue-gray fronts offset the white marble and are adorned with simple hardware in a satin nickel finish. On the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peninsula</a> side of the kitchen’s U-shaped counters, refrigerator and freezer drawers are tucked discreetly underneath to reduce visual clutter and maximize space efficiency. A stainless steel undermount sink is matched to an industrial faucet and sprayer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the side of the peninsula that faces the living room, the ledge of the counter was extended to create a space for bar seating with built-in 12-bottle wine storage as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft09-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30426 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft09-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30375 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft08-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30377 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft10-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the homeowner chose to continue the marble theme with herringbone floors, a warm subway tile on the walls, and the same 2-inch-thick Carrara marble from the kitchen as a counter. With a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frameless glass divider</a>, the deep soaking tub does double duty for baths and showers. Three well-placed niches, including one inside the tub area, add storage for toiletries and small décor objects.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30378 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before04-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30418 size-chrono" title="guest room and office" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft20-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30382 mb-0 size-chrono" title="guest room and office" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft01-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom, which benefits from one of the apartment’s enormous west-facing windows, was slightly reconfigured. The previous owners had installed floor-to-ceiling shelving with a library ladder, which was a good concept but needed to be scaled back. In its place, the Sweeten contractor built open shelving across the length of the room, keeping it within the overhead space so that it didn&#8217;t narrow the feel of the room. When its sliding doors are open, the space feeds into the living room for an open feeling. When the doors are closed, however, there is total privacy in the bedroom.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft19.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30380 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dressing room and closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft19.gif" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closet</a>, which was initially small and located inside the room, was relocated into a newly-created walk-in dressing room between the bedroom and bathroom. The homeowner wanted a closet with plenty of space on three walls for clothing and accessories. The design is perfect for couples, allowing one person to sleep peacefully while the other is getting ready for the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the apartment, the outdated flooring was replaced with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural white oak</a> in 7-inch-wide planks. Sourced from Vermont, the new floorboards—long rift and quarter-sawn—show a &#8220;tigering&#8221; striped effect and are perfectly suited to the space, making a stylish first impression.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mixing luxurious touches with economic ones, the Sweeten team was able to achieve the modern and fresh aesthetic that the homeowner imagined. What did he learn from his renovation experience? “Hire the right contractor and stay very close to the project. I feel like I made every micro decision, but it worked out! The unit looks great and I am a happy customer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An architect dodged a shady general contractor in the nick of time and ended up with a perfect Sweeten home</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ana and Leo survived the complex process of selling their old apartment and buying a new one simultaneously—no easy feat!—but were nearly taken by an unscrupulous contractor when it came time to renovate. They realized that they needed someone they could trust to facilitate the search for general contractors and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors—</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">turned out to be exactly what they were looking for. (Their words, not ours!) Their Sweeten contractor helped them make layout changes and took on the challenge of creating an oversized sliding door system that allowed the conversion of an open office space into a private guest suite. Here&#8217;s how the couple transformed their Tribeca apartment from an awkward warren of rooms into an open, flexible space that is both comfortable and refined, including redoing the living room, office/guest room, dining space, bedroom, and of course the kitchen and two bathrooms.<br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25429 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22" width="1000" height="706" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-723x510.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-300x212.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Tribeca homeowner and architect Ana</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every real estate agent told us it could not be done. That, in New York, it was nearly impossible to coordinate the sale of our current apartment with the purchase of a new one. But my husband, Leo, was determined, so that is what we set out to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a long search and many disappointments, including lost bid wars and a contract that fell through, fate brought us an amazing real estate broker who made it all possible. <a href="https://www.kristiambrosetti.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristi Ambrosetti</a> was not fazed by the sell-buy challenge and helped us find our new home and sell our old one.</p>
<p>The apartment met all of our requirements—a 1,000-square-foot, 2-bed, 2-bath in a doorman building in Tribeca, with great light and plenty of storage space. The interior, however, was still in its original condition from the &#8217;80s; it needed a complete renovation to update finishes and fix layout issues that made the space feel choppy and awkward—the exact opposite of the contemporary open space we had hoped for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being an architect, I developed the initial plans for the renovation and met with several general contractors that claimed to be available for the job. After <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comparing multiple bids</a>, we were close to signing with one of them but decided to do some background checking first. I was shocked to find that the address listed in their documents was actually an empty storefront in Queens. The thought that we were very close to making a substantial down payment with someone that might not show up for the job really scared us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At that point, we took the search for general contractors online and came across Sweeten. We read about their screening process to find qualified professionals, and it sounded exactly like what we were looking for, so we decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg5YkmLFz4a5xkDfbtxLMvC7WWzQ">post our project</a>. From the beginning, the experience was surprisingly straightforward. Posting on the website was easy and we were soon matched with a few professionals. When we started interviewing potential general contractors, we were contacted by Miranda from Sweeten and she helped us through the whole process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the weeks we had spent interviewing general contractors, we also focused on finalizing the layout and decisions on finishes and fixtures. By the time we signed with our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDUErsavPF6GS1QXwyFWAiekS7sA">chosen Sweeten contractor</a>, we were ready to begin demolition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leo and I had been a little apprehensive about some of our design choices, especially when it came to the changes in the layout, which were intended to make the space more open and flexible. But when demolition began, it became clear that we were on the right track.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening up the kitchen</a>, the contractor also eliminated a narrow wall that partially blocked the entryway and made for a very awkward hallway. Squaring off the angled wall between the living room and the master bedroom made both spaces a lot more pleasant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The change that made the most impact, though, was opening the office (which would double as a guest suite) into the living room. Oversized <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding panels</a> would allow the room to be closed off and provide privacy for overnight guests. However, most of the professionals we spoke to thought the panels would be too heavy and could not be done. The Sweeten contracting team accepted the challenge and executed them beautifully.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-15-16.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25014 size-full" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-15-16.gif" alt="general contractors" width="1000" height="667" /></a><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">The one setback we had during demolition was an unexpected electrical conduit found in one of the living room walls we had planned to demolish. The conduit ran down to the apartment below ours and, therefore, could not be moved. After conversations with the contractor, Leo and I decided to take down the rest of the wall as originally planned and leave only the section that had the conduit, creating a corner niche that was perfect for a bookshelf. Once the renovation was complete, this turned out to be one of our favorite features in the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One aspect that had drawn us to the apartment was a nook next to the living room that seemed perfect for a small bar. Early in the project, we pulled inspiration photos online and it seemed like designing the bar would be fairly easy. That was until we decided the bar should also house a concealed 40-inch TV, which then led to weeks of research and multiple drawing iterations until we landed on a design that met all of our functional requirements for both the bar and the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dining room pendants were another big challenge. The position of the existing light did not align with the center of the dining table, and we were not able to move the light because of the concrete ceiling. I had almost given up on having pendants over the table when Leo came across the Swell String fixture, which allowed for the pendants to be installed in any position, independent of the canopy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The finishes for the bathrooms and kitchen were also much debated. We knew from the beginning we wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble tile</a> in the bathrooms but looked at a wide range of patterns, sizes, and prices. Narrowing down the search to neutral tones and classic patterns, I eventually chose an Asian statuary from TileBar for the master bathroom and a Bardiglio herringbone mosaic for the guest bathroom floor, with the same Asian statuary in the shower. As a contrast to the traditional tile, I selected modern Duravit fixtures and Grohe faucets. The towel warmers had been at the top of our wishlist and after much research, we were able to find a small hardwired option that worked well in both bathrooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25010 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="general contractors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25008 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04.jpg" alt="general contractors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For our small <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">galley kitchen</a>, we chose the same low-maintenance quartz countertops we had in our previous apartment, paired with white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinets</a> and integrated Bosch appliances. The cabinets were finished with black linear pulls with accent walnut shelves added on the back wall for some extra storage. The backsplash was probably one of the toughest decisions—with so many interesting materials and patterns to choose from, we considered all sorts of options, from large back-painted glass panels to intricate mosaics. As a way to balance the modern cabinets and countertops, we decided on marble subway tile from TileBar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our main goals for the master bedroom were to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/bedroom-storage-style-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximize storage</a> and improve circulation. So the swing bedroom door was replaced with a pocket door, improving access to a long wall of closets that ended in a small custom-made vanity at the corner of the room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Leo and I found that all the time spent obsessing over the small details really paid off—it all came together as we had hoped and we were very happy, not only with our choices but with the quality of execution and expertise the Sweeten contractor and his team brought to the project. Most importantly, knowing Sweeten was following the project, and touching base with us periodically gave us peace of mind through the whole process.</span></p>
