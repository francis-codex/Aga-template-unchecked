										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>An Australian chef opens up for coffee lovers</h3>
<p><em>With an opportunity to make a mark in NYC, Eliot, an Australian chef, opens his first café stateside. The 175-square-foot space he found in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea was disheveled and in need of a makeover. He came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a renovation platform connecting renovators with vetted general contractors, and found a contractor who would transform it into an espresso and coffee shop with the feeling of an Aussie beachside.</em></p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What is Clovelly Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> Clovelly is an extension of my love for the Australian café culture. We carefully select coffee cherries from around the world, which are roasted and brewed with love and passion. Our goal was to create a cozy space in the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. Here, you can engage with your barista while enjoying a coffee from our weekly rotating menu of single-origin beans and pastries.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Where did the idea for the business come from?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> Clovelly Coffee is a café inspired by Clovelly, a Sydney beachside suburb and my Australian hometown.</p>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the opening of this new brick-and-mortar space?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> After making the move to Manhattan with my wife, we quickly connected with this vibrant city and the New Yorkers who shared the love for coffee.</p>
<p>As a working chef in Sydney, I ran my first successful café for five years. Now in New York, Clovelly is a family-owned business and my second venture in continuing my passion for coffee and food with an Aussie edge.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How does your new café design and the materials used represent your brand?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> The design of the space has a distinct beach-y feel. The use of white evokes an Aussie beachside café feel with gold/brass finishes. By adding splashes of yellow and blue (pulling from the colorful textures found at Clovelly Beach), we recreated the golden sun and sand and the blue in the Pacific Ocean from our hometown.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How was your vision executed by working with your Sweeten general contractor?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> Our contractor was instrumental in the process. They helped us find solutions in real-time and helped us stay on budget. They also offered alternatives to issues that arose.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a small space, we had challenges fitting in plumbing pipes. However, by making adjustments to walls and getting creative with the direction of the pipes, we were able to make it all fit.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you, as a client, work with Sweeten?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> Sweeten kept in contact with me throughout the process. We reached out to them whenever we needed extra advice or guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do you think Sweeten can help entrepreneurial business owners like yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> They are experts at connecting you with a contractor who is the right fit for you. They also help you interpret quotes so you can make this crucial decision.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Can you describe the “before” space?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> It was damaged and messy, including cracks in the floor tiles.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What’s next for the brand?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> We j<span class="s1">ust launched a catering menu, with a selection of artisan pastries and freshly brewed coffee.</span> I&#8217;m also looking to add a second location with seating.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovate and open up a kitchen in a Ditmas Park, Brooklyn co-op</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Lindsay, a director at Brooks Brothers, and Roger, a director in pre-sales at StyleLabs, purchased their 1,075-square-foot, two-bedroom co-op in 2016. Roger “loves to play around in the kitchen,” said his wife, Lindsay. While the kitchen was dark, outdated, and not very functional, the space also didn&#8217;t offer a clear sight line between the kitchen and living room. “We wanted a more family-friendly space, opened up so whoever was in the kitchen could interact with family and friends in the living room,&#8221; they said. &#8220;And we wanted some kind of island/breakfast bar.” After living in the co-op for about a year, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and planned a renewed flow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32796 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-1-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Lindsay was about nine months pregnant during the renovation, something she wouldn’t recommend to anyone doing a remodel. “The challenge of trying to get around the apartment that was in complete disrepair was interesting on some days,” she said. “We ended up moving the entire kitchen and living room into the nursery. I’d recommend going on a vacation or taking a long weekend trip during the major part of the construction. You think you can live through it for a week or two, and then realize how long a week or two really is. It would have been a nice break to go somewhere where there wasn’t dust and tools and boxes everywhere.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32801 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Their Sweeten contractor</a> “knew we wanted to get everything done in time for the baby to come<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>with a little bit of time to spare to clean up the nursery,” Lindsay said. “They were good at communicating what the status was, how long something was going to take, and how much time we had to make a decision.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33272 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-3-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Before-3" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-32806" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen07-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN LindsayConnolly Kitchen07" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The job was basically a “rip-and-replace” with a new peninsula where the wall between the kitchen and living space once stood. The only appliance that moved was the refrigerator, which stayed on the same wall. For the cabinets, their contractor recommended <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a kitchen designer in the Sweeten network</a>. The kitchen designers provided the initial custom cabinet layout, then Lindsay visualized the usability of the kitchen. “I mapped all of our stuff from pantry and appliances to a drawer or cabinet. Then I was able to work with our contractor to determine the best shelf or drawer configuration to utilize the space and fit our stuff,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32807 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen08-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen13.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32812 mb-0 size-chrono" title="light-brown-cabinets-white-quartz-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen13.gif" alt="light brown wooden cabinets and white quartz counter and gray walls after renovation " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The duo chose an island/breakfast bar so guests would feel like a part of the cooking process. Tall cabinets like the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry</a> gave them more storage with pull-out drawers for easy access and a large drawer for their spices. A separate small counter and shelves stand in as their “coffee bar.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aside from the difficulties of being pregnant and having to move things during the renovation, Lindsay felt it would have been easier had they spent more time deciding on appliances in advance and budgeting in the little things like cabinet hardware, lighting, faucet, and sink. “You’ve got to be flexible and open-minded to extending your timeline if something is not available immediately, or finding a substitute material.” She also would have raised her <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost expectations</a> another $5,000 to $10,000. “There’s always something you forget or didn’t know you had to pay for, like licensing fees just to get co-op approval.” (See Bonus section below.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32797 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-2-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32803 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen04-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32810 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen11-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lindsay cautions other first-timers to be prepared to pay a fee to show a copy of a license for plumbers and electricians, a fee for an engineer to review the design, and a fee for the management company and/or board to review and approve. There were several back-and-forth discussions to get the paperwork exactly right for the approval. “It took us six to eight weeks to get everything in order and get the final approvals,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the bumps, Lindsay and Roger—and now Porter, born in January just after the project was finished—are delighted to be able to entertain family and friends from their new, open kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32800 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen01-1-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The couple had actually posted this project on Sweeten twice. There were “politics,” Lindsay said, in getting it approved through the co-op. “We thought we could just submit the design and it would be approved,” she said. “The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">approval process</a> for our co-op board was multi-level, which we didn’t understand when we first posted.”</p>
<p>They removed their posting and Sweeten’s client services helped Lindsay rewrite it and narrow down the choices while they searched for a contractor match. Once they found a potential match, several other factors were required by the board, and their contractors “took the time to go through the copy of the board requirements before we officially selected them,” Lindsay said. “As a first-time renovator and co-op owner, we were happy to have a little guidance from someone who has been through this process before.” <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
