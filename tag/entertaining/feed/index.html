<h3>Remodeling for a new life chapter</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a Manhattan couple bought their three-bedroom apartment in Kips Bay Towers, designed by renowned architects I.M. Pei and S.J. Kessler, more than 30 years ago, they renovated. Fast forward three decades, which included the whirlwind of raising kids, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/renovations-dream-homes-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was time for a redo</a>. What had looked good then, now looked tired and outdated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen had already been renovated a second time and the avid entertainers, who host plenty of dinner parties, made the living and dining rooms next on the renovation list. Their interior designer, <a href="https://tarabenet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tara Benet</a>, turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found this Sweeten contractor</a> to bring the vision to life.</p>
<div></div>
<h3>Enhancing natural light in the home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The heavy linen curtains were drab and did not gracefully frame the exceptional floor-to-ceiling views from the glass-front apartment complex. The cream and beige tones also did little to complement the New York City backdrop. Comfy couches and cluttered decor lacked the glamorous, crisp, and adventurous style reflecting the couple&#8217;s modern-day taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wood flooring also became an issue. The original rug had been in the same spot for 30 years. The intense natural light left a darker footprint where the UV rays had not faded the varnish. The couple went with a lighter floor color to match the overall brighter look, adding a fresh touch to the whole renovation. Previously, the homeowners had used old-fashioned track lighting because the concrete ceiling couldn’t take any sunken lights. Their modern solution? Using two chandeliers to light the room. As a bonus, their unique design also made them a focal point in the living area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-11-1.jpg" alt="Manhattan renovation, Murray Hill, home, design, living room, open floor plan" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35659" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-11-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-11-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-11-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-11-1-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-11-1-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A white-painted background became a canvas for the other elements in the room to stand out. However, the couple came to learn that white is never just white. &#8220;There was a lot of debate over the white which needed to be a little bit warmer than it was before. We ended up with a shade that has a tiny bit of orange. It has a glow to it,&#8221; Tara said. And to offset the white, a muted royal blue acts as a deep color accent and can be seen running through the custom-made rug, a throw rug, and the living room chairs. (Blue is also a contrasting color to the orange hue added to the white paint.)</p>
<h3>Picking the materials and color palette</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A secondary color palette—the metallics of brass, bronze, and gold—further balance the blue accent. This is seen in the vases on the dining room table, in the construction of the coffee table, woven into the pillows, and throughout the lamps and light fixtures.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With the strength of the view through the windows, Tara helped her clients achieve an uncluttered look and did not use much wall art. To inject some creativity, they picked out well-designed furniture that could almost double as art pieces. The blue chairs from designer Walter Knoll function like little works of art that you can sit in, as do the Roche Bobois sofas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1.jpg" alt="Manhattan renovation, Murray Hill, home, design, living room, open floor plan, dining room" width="1000" height="1400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35656" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-214x300.jpg 214w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-600x840.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-723x1012.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-585x819.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The heavy linen drapes were replaced with near-translucent fabric, letting in more light and giving a gossamery feel. And the view will never be obscured. The curtains are purely for appearances; they are locked into the ceiling and floor and cannot be moved, ensuring the &#8220;wow&#8221; moment when guests get a first glimpse of the cityscape. &#8220;They literally never want to close the windows,&#8221; Tara said.</p>
<h3>The key to remodeling success? Team communication.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Tara, their Sweeten contractor was a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great communicator and in constant communication</a> with her and the clients. He was even willing to meet with the client on weekends to keep the project on schedule. With a touch up for the millwork, a fresh coat of paint, and refinishing the floor varnish, it’s a reminder that less often equals more when luxe furniture and lighting make up a dream space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Dining in style, from kitchen tables to islands with seating</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the eat-in kitchen, the “eat-in” part is usually the last piece of the puzzle. Kitchen design typically revolves around cooking while the notion of dining in the space is often an afterthought. However, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a renovation platform connecting homeowners to a vetted general contractor, has seen a growing trend in considering both activities during the design stage. While small spaces demand multiple functionality in the kitchen, a more thoughtfully layout combines seating, a more organic flow, and space planning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Explore the possibilities that these Sweeten homeowners undertook with their eat-in kitchens, from dining tables to counter seating. All will invite family and friends to &#8220;break bread&#8221; with you at home!</p>
<h3>A kitchen banquette beckons for company</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43214" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg" alt="kitchen banquette" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With only one window in the kitchen to let in light, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/duplex-remodel-first-time-renovators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenn and Jon</a> took steps to create a brighter atmosphere for their family of four. A partial wall that sectioned off an eat-in area from the kitchen came down effectively joining the two spaces and letting the sunshine stream in. Cooking and eating together were top priorities and a U-shaped banquette lent a cozy gathering spot around the square-shaped dining table. Wallpaper and paneling give it separation and personality.</p>
<h3>A peninsula bar multitasks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41636" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="dining nook" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-riverdale-bronx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth and Martin</a>’s 124-square-foot galley kitchen, tackling the space planning and bringing a sense of openness was done with the help of their Sweeten design-build team. The couple&#8217;s comfort level for all of the renovation changes was put at ease with “sketches from every angle.” Pulling down two partial walls was step one in bringing in more light. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new peninsula bar seats four to five stools reminiscent of a cute bistro—and holds storage. Form and function increase with more prep space, glass-front cabinets, and a mix of finishes. Clutter minimizes with the microwave tucked behind a cabinet and the paper towel holder rolls out from under the countertop.</span></p>
<h3>More function for a larger kitchen</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42916" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1.jpg" alt="Townhouse renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/apartment-vs-house-a-brooklyn-family-decides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jill and Cy</a> created an open concept on the first floor of their single-family townhouse. The kitchen was expanded for the family of four by turning a full bath into a powder room giving more exposure to the black-trimmed doors leading to the backyard. With ample room, a dining table and chairs fit easily in the cook space for meals and entertaining. The flat-panel walnut cabinetry, ceiling light fixture, and furniture displayed the mid-century modern aesthetic. A cut-out window seat that doubles as storage was a bonus feature.</span></p>
<h3>Centerstage for an island</h3>

Aiming for the rustic look, two sides were live edge while the wood’s cherry red tone was lacquered. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The refrigerator was relocated within a row of existing closets off the kitchen proper creating a unified flow for the rest of the apartment. A disguised pantry covered in subway tile is a fun “Where’s Waldo?” moment. And that walnut slab? There was enough left over to fashion open shelving for the kitchen, home office, and the bathroom.</span></p>

Situated underneath the loft, a small dining table and chairs enhance the cozy grotto feel. Opting for an L-shaped layout, appliances moved along the back wall giving room to install plenty of countertop surface. A mix of stainless steel and white cabinets are backdrops to a glossy black tempered glass backsplash. </span></p>

The key to owning and making the most of the space is a layout that maximizes efficiency, like a galley. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By definition, a galley kitchen consists of two parallel sides with a narrow passage in between. </span><span class="s1">A galley kitchen layout works best for small kitchens—less than 90 square feet. Four to 6 feet between parallel sides maximize efficiency and workflow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out these <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> kitchens to see how this type of small-space layout can work for you.</span></p><h3>A breakthrough for a galley kitchen</h3><p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="Galley kitchen with stainless steel refrigerator" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56034" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Andrew and Germàn modernized their galley kitchen in their 1936 Med-Deco home. The room was closed off to the rest of the living spaces. The renovation plan was to keep the square footage the same so as to not disturb any architectural details with expansion. However, breaking through the wall for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/a-kitchen-pass-through-gets-social-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass-through breakfast bar</a> was the solution to open the space up to the living room. It was the right decision: it ended up becoming an eight-foot centerpiece in the home.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><h3>Smart design expands this tiny galley kitchen</h3><p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21360 size-full" title="galley kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>The six-foot-wide <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">galley kitchen</a> in Emily’s prewar apartment was originally an enclosed space. Several ideas helped it feel open and less closed in. <span class="s1">In place of upper cabinets, open shelving in marble and brass offered the airiness the small kitchen needed. </span><span class="s2">An undercounter refrigerator took up less space and was less visually intrusive.</span></p><p>To make the layout more ideal for entertaining, her Sweeten contractor created a pass-through window with an extended counter and two stools on the non-kitchen side. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post your project</a> on Sweeten.

All new fixtures contributed to the lighter look, as did the extension of a pass-through window into the main living space. Her contractor knocked down the bar to countertop height and enlarged the opening. Now, all the light from the neighboring room streams in.</span></p><h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A smart layout is key in a </span>galley kitchen</h3><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-13-1.jpg" alt="black granite countertop in a white galley kitchen with white kitchen cabinets with handles and white backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50376" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-13-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-13-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-13-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Storage and a smart layout made all the difference for Monica’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/charm-queens-row-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen remodel</a>. For more convenient kitchen storage, a broom closet was transformed into a pull-out food pantry. The refrigerator sat outside of the row of board-and-batten-style cabinets keeping its height and size out of sight. Adding to the galley kitchen’s character was a cozy eat-in dining niche.</span></p><h3>A single wall of cabinets suits a narrow galley kitchen</h3><p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20690 size-full" title="galley kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">To maximize Jenna’s </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/making-way-for-a-nursery-and-more-in-this-duplex-apartment-renovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">narrow galley kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a run of upper and base cabinets sit along one wall, and face a flush refrigerator and uncluttered wall. Although she admits, “I’m in the process of creating a “bucket list” installation for the remaining wall, though I’m enjoying the space the empty wall creates.” With only the width of a range to work in, this layout presents an efficient way to navigate this space.</span></p><h3>Open shelves in a galley kitchen look stylishly neat</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21171 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Daniel, a food writer and former chef, installed <span class="s2">open shelving</span></span><span class="s3"> instead of upper cabinets along half of the wall in the kitchen. This eliminated the feeling of claustrophobia that plagued the old kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His Sweeten contractor moved the fridge away from the entryway, where it had made entering the kitchen difficult. It was relocated to the opposite end creating symmetry and making it easier to move through the space.

They instead used that extra space to take advantage of the room’s length and install lower cabinets all the way to the window wall. To make it feel even bigger, they opted for one long wood shelf opposite the wall of upper cabinets.</span></p><h3>Clever idea: shallow cabinets save space</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37242 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Inwood kitchen renovation, remodel, after, design, construction" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandra and Michael overhauled their </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/sustainable-remodel-inwood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing galley kitchen layout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to add more cabinet and counter space. They chose narrow base cabinets (basically wall cabinets) to save the square footage without making it feel more cramped.</span></p><h3>Relocating a bulky fridge frees up valuable space</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23887 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />In Hari and Kaity’s galley kitchen the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hari-kaitys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refrigerator placement</a> minimized counter space and the surrounding walls made the whole space tight. They relocated it to a spot a few feet outside of the kitchen walls. A cutout in the wall at the entrance also helped free up space. Pro tip: if you’re unsure about taking down walls, moving your refrigerator can be an alternative to free up space while preserving the existing layout.</p><h3>A galley kitchen puts dead space to use</h3><p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="galley kitchen with blue walls and granite countertops" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-28402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten homeowner Rashmi had no interest in an open kitchen when it was time to renovate. She lived with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/manhattan-kitchen-remodel-turns-true-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley kitchen</a> for four years to understand what she needed from the room. To save space, shallower 18” kitchen cabinets were installed on one side. Closer to the entry, a narrow eat-in bar that was an extension from the countertop in the kitchen fit two stools. Opposite the bar, Rashmi installed built-in cabinets for storage and a washer and dryer. It had once been dead space.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span>.</span></p><p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46407 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png" alt="Get Matched With Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p><p><i>A note on fixture and appliance deliveries</i>: If you’re on a tight timeline, <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100545793-15162279"><span class="s1">Appliances Connection</span></a> has over 50,000 items in stock and ready to ship nationally.

The ideal distance between the two walls is four to six feet, which helps to maximize efficiency and workflow. Homeowners with smaller kitchens–meaning less than 90 square feet–would benefit from a galley kitchen layout.</p></div>

First, using built-in refrigerators and dishwashers–which are only 24 inches deep–creates a seamless, flush line between appliances and cabinets. This eliminates protruding handles or edges. Second, choose your color palette wisely. Light-colored cabinets, like white, gray, and agave, make small spaces look bigger, as do glossy, reflective surfaces. Third, talk to a contractor about adding a pass-through window. These open up the space and allow for guests to mingle while the hosts prepare food. Lastly, look at the overall placement of your cabinets and appliances. Move bulky items, like fridges, away from the kitchen entrance as these can create visual barriers to the space and make it look smaller.</p></div>

Alternatively, it can be installed overhead elsewhere in the kitchen. Separating the appliances help with flow and movement if more than one cook is working in the space. Drawer-style microwaves can also be placed in lower cabinets and functions as a pull-out.</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>With spaces that flow and connect, reimagine the way they can be lived in</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An open floor plan provides plenty of space to get creative. Instead of each room having a distinct purpose or design, the layout offers a multifunctional space with unified decor. Combining the living and dining rooms has many benefits; for one, hosting parties is much easier when guests aren’t confined to a single dining room. The larger space lends itself to a more social atmosphere that brings the whole family together and feels cozy rather than cramped. Ready to embrace open-plan living? Take inspiration from the Sweeten renovations below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-29884" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-10-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-10" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marsha and Adam</a> took down walls on the main floor of their brownstone to connect the living and dining rooms. Rugs define the borders for each space in a way that doesn’t feel as isolated as dividing walls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-31170" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While renovating the kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren</a> shifted her living room furniture closer to the windows and carved out a spot for a table and chairs, a setup that wouldn’t have fit in the original layout. The long-awaited dining area makes it possible for her to finally have friends over for dinner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-29277" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way, it became clear that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-loft-in-a-former-silk-warehouse-gets-a-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara and Ryan</a> needed to add walls to their open-plan loft to create two separate bedrooms. The dining area was moved closer to the living room furniture and replaced with a long table with bench seating that mirrors the length of the couch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-living-space-recessed-lights" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-32367" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg" alt="gray living space with recessed lights on ceiling and couch along with white round breakfast table and chairs after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lack of a formal dining room led <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/with-this-reno-i-thee-wed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heather and Eric</a> to embrace the combined living and dining area in their newly purchased apartment. Choosing all-white furniture for the couch, table, and chairs makes the arrangement feel more intentional and coordinated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28216" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After converting part of the living room into a second bedroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/queens-condo-overhaul-begins-with-kitchen-sink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah and Craig</a> moved their living room furniture next to the dining table. The new and improved layout creates a central hub for gatherings that isn&#8217;t far from the built-in bar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Strengthen your defense against the mess</h2>
<p><em>In our month-long Organizational Blitz, see how Sweeten homeowners have whipped their homes into shape.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30038 mb-0 size-chrono" title="newsletter-banner" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2-723x482.jpg" alt="newsletter banner" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1000x667-Organize-Blitz-v2-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to keeping your home in good shape, every space—from the bedroom to the bar—has a role to play. Even if you’re a minimalist, you’ve got plenty of stuff to store (perhaps a little less than the rest of us), and creating storage that can accommodate everything is crucial. If you find yourself closer to the maximalist end of the spectrum (count us in!), whether you’ve got a growing pile of books or an impressive liquor collection, getting organized is possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25922 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bookshelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-13-723x1095.jpg" alt="home organization" width="723" height="1095" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With bookshelves, you don’t have to consolidate your collection of books to maintain order in your home. Any room can host your library—and we’ve got 5 ways to prove it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_MarioApt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22188 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_MarioApt-06-723x517.jpg" alt="home organization" width="723" height="517" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best organization strategy takes into consideration every room in your home, including the bedroom. From floating shelves to custom built-ins, find spots for all of your personal belongings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A primer on cooking with steam and convection ovens</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-08-Oven.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28737 mb-10 size-chrono" title="steam convection oven" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-08-Oven-723x546.jpg" alt="steam convection oven" width="723" height="546" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-08-Oven-723x546.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-08-Oven-300x227.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-08-Oven-600x453.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-08-Oven.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<span class="img-label"> A Bosch steam convection oven in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy and Nick&#8217;s kitchen</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you love to cook you’ve probably heard about steam cooking. This method has graduated from the vegetable steamer of the ‘70s to more sophisticated options that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freestanding steam oven, which cooks solely with steam</li>
<li>The combination steam oven, which combines several functions: steam alone, convection and steam, or convection alone</li>
<li>The electric oven, which includes an added moisture function that injects bursts of steam into the heated oven cavity</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Freestanding steam ovens take up about as much counter space as a high-end microwave, and they cost about the same—in the $300 range. This makes sense if you want to use steam cooking but don’t wish to replace your existing oven yet. However, if you regularly cook complete meals, a built-in combination steam and convection oven could make more sense. This version is available from all the major manufacturers, such as Thermador, Miele, Wolf, and Gaggenau, but expect to pay more than a conventional oven—as much as $3,000 to $8,000. The payoff? Manufacturers promise more bang for these bucks in faster, healthier results for all types of foods, along with nifty additional features, including proofing for bread, automatic boiling point detection, more than a dozen cooking modes, recipe retention, a self-cleaning function, and text display in dozens of languages.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, surveys the features and attributes of steam cooking.</p>
<h3>What are the benefits?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While steam cooking may not be right for every type of meal you prepare, it does offer many advantages consistent with the lifestyles and eating preferences of many home chefs today. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster cooking</li>
<li>Healthier results</li>
<li>Reheating or refreshing food</li>
<li>Holding cooked food for several hours</li>
<li>Thawing frozen food</li>
<li>Cooking several dishes simultaneously</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Common sense tells you that food cooked in steam retains moisture better than food cooked in dry heat. This translates into a reduced need for oil or added fats to prevent food from drying out. It also vastly reduces the evaporation of vitamins and minerals. Moisture is also a more effective heat conductor than dry, hot air, so steam ovens, especially when combined with convection, will cook food in less time—as much as a third or a half—than a conventional oven.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a steam oven, manufacturers say that several dishes can be cooked together with no flavor transfer or temperature adjustment needed, shortening overall prep and cooking time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The humid environment also does a better job of reheating or refreshing a dish that’s been held over. Since there isn’t a risk of the food drying out, it won’t lose its original texture. Steam cooking cannot brown foods so you may need to switch from steam to convection to finish a dish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Temperatures will run from 120° to over 400° F to handle everything from a delicate fish to a tray of potatoes to a substantial roast. To get a crispy finish for fowl or fish, transfer items to a stovetop pan to sear before serving. Some of these cooking methods require more steps, so a combo steam and convection oven isn&#8217;t for the novice cook. When shopping, ask the salesperson about cooking demos for steam ovens. Many showrooms offer free classes both prior to purchase and after.<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Steam ovens create steam from one of two sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reservoir that must be filled with water prior to use</li>
<li>A plumbed line (like water fed to your icemaker in the fridge)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Heat from the oven turns the water into steam. The oven controls regulate the temperature in the cavity and the humidity. These sophisticated ovens come with preprogrammed modes that determine the correct setting for any type of food you plan to cook, from vegetables to meats to baked goods, rice, and soup.</p>
<h3>What about convection?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are, if you added a new oven to your kitchen in the last five to 10 years, it has a convection function. Because convection uses a fan to circulate air through the oven cavity, it&#8217;s good at keeping the temperature steady and uniform. The circulating air also serves to cook the food more evenly, and sometimes more quickly, since heat is not concentrated from a single location.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a combination steam and convection oven, the fan moves the moist, heated air throughout the cavity. It also allows you to switch to convection alone. This option is handy for some foods such as quick breads or pies to get a nice, brown finish. Consult the user’s manual when baking for the first time.</p>
<h3>Is it easy to clean?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After use, most steam ovens must be wiped down to remove all the moisture in the cavity. Neglect this task and you invite the possibility of mold as well as scales from minerals in the water. You will also need to remove the reservoir to let it dry completely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The advantage is that the steam prevents most splatters from cooking that would end up on the oven walls. Some manufacturers, such as Gaggenau, include a fully automatic cleaning system for their ovens that operate with the push of a button.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Steam cooking is without a doubt the latest trend in food prep. However, with its many benefits—healthier meals, shortened cooking times, and tasty results—it’s a trend that should stick around.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>To outfit this crowd-pleaser, choose the right spot to build; add a good grill and other outdoor kitchen appliances</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25421 size-chrono" title="outdoor kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-723x482.jpg" alt="outdoor kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>(Above) This Kalamazoo outdoor kitchen features a built-in grill, weather-tight cabinets, refrigerator drawers, and a pizza oven sitting on the countertop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to eat out more often, but hate spending a fortune on restaurants, you should consider an outdoor kitchen. While you can spend almost as much on an <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/outdoor-kitchen-patio-ideas/">outdoor kitchen</a> as your indoor one, it’ll ultimately add resale value to your home. In a recent study, the National Association of Home Builders reported that outdoor kitchens add at least 100 percent of their value to a home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make the most of your outdoor kitchen, consider carefully these points:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Enhance your outdoor kitchen space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work with your contractor on finding the ideal location to build out your kitchen. Classic materials like brick, stone, or stucco can work nicely with many architectural styles of a home. These materials work especially well with older homes—and appear integrated.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Make your outdoor kitchen comfortable</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Allow room for dining and lounging both before and after the meal. You&#8217;ll need a shady or covered area paved with stone or wood to support furniture. You also want to add lighting for the dining and seating area, plus the kitchen area. This way, you&#8217;ll enjoy the space after sundown, while having an <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/entertaining-kitchens/">open plan that keeps the cook near the guests</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Pick outdoor kitchen appliances wisely</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Buy only what you know you will really use. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/">Avoid fixtures that serve only one function, unless you will use them regularly</a>. If your family loves pizza, by all means, add the pizza oven. If you entertain frequently, you can use a warming drawer. But do you really need that smoker?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Invest in high-quality outdoor kitchen materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything that goes into your outdoor kitchen should be made to work outdoors. But, still, everything you have installed will remain outside year-round, so it needs to be able to withstand changing weather. Buy from brands with national reputations so you can get a customer service person when you need one, including on the weekend. Also, <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-ways-care-renovated-home/">check the warranties</a> to make certain the company will back up their products.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Expect the unexpected</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At some point, an appliance or pipe will have to be repaired or possibly replaced. Work with your contractor to design installation so that electrical, gas, and water can be easily reached for repair or adjustment, if needed, without breaking down any beautiful stone surround or concrete foundation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Plan the setup and location of your outdoor kitchen</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your setup can be built-in or freestanding, depending on its location in relation to the structure of your house. Freestanding is quicker to get up and running, and you can take some features (like the grill) with you, should you move. However, built-in gives a more designed look and allows for optional but important features like a sink. ”If they are relatively close together, an outdoor kitchen can utilize the indoor kitchen’s capabilities, such as prep space and storage,” says Russ Faulk, chief designer and head of product for <a href="https://kalamazoogourmet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kalamazoo Outdoor Gourmet</a>, a manufacturer of outdoor kitchen appliances. “Conversely, a fully independent outdoor kitchen with refrigeration, warming cabinets and cabinetry is more self-reliant, but will require more space and connections for gas, water, and electricity.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are also outdoor kitchen appliance “kits” from companies like EP Henry. These include everything—the grill, cabinets, countertop, even bricks for the surrounding structure, plus a sink. Only experienced DIYers should put this combo together and will need to pull all the permits for construction and utilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the location of a built-in kitchen, if you place it against an outer wall of your house, you won’t have to run water and gas lines as far as if you were to locate it some further distance within the yard. You will, however, likely need a <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/">ventilation hood to prevent cooking smells from drifting</a> into your house. Work with an experienced contractor who can help you maximize your budget by finding the best location for easy utility access. He or she will also be able to tell you if you need that vent hood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Location (and climate) will also be a factor as to whether your outdoor kitchen grill station should be sheltered or exposed. Even appliances made for outdoor use shouldn&#8217;t be exposed to driving rain or snow, or prolonged, sub-zero temperatures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Always check to see if a permit is necessary before starting your outdoor kitchen project,” advises Russ. Your contractor can handle this, as he or she should be highly knowledgeable about local codes. These codes would include easement, permeable surface requirements, water restrictions, and height restrictions. Besides getting help with all those permits, learn about the other benefits of working with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed contractor</a> on your outdoor kitchen project.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choosing the right features</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The outdoor kitchen can be as large and tricked out as your space and budget will allow, but to make it fully functional, you will need to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition/">outfit it like you do the indoor kitchen</a>, with designated areas for prep, cooking, and clean-up, as well as dining and hanging out.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: The grill</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the center of any kitchen is the stove or, in this case, an outdoor kitchen grill.  Outdoors kitchen grills can be as sophisticated as you want, with two, three, or five burners, plus an accompanying warming drawer, side burners, and pizza oven. Confirm that whatever outdoor grill you choose is from an established manufacturer that specializes in grills and offers a solid warranty.  If you’re in the market for a freestanding outdoor kitchen grill, look at companies like KitchenAid, Dacor, and Monogram. These brands are known for their indoor cooking appliances, and also offer outdoor gas-operated products. Their outdoor products have modern combos of multiple burners and side grills, which let you cook several items simultaneously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Manufacturers devoted just to grills, like Weber, also offer plenty of choice for both freestanding and built-ins. Check that the area below the grill can handle the grill&#8217;s weight, and the heat it will emit, as well as any sparks that might fly out. The counter or workspace should be adjacent to the grill and burners. Make sure you can sanitize it for food preparation. “Keep a buffer zone between hot grills, ovens or cooktops and any people,” says Russ, who recommends a minimum of 9 inches of countertop extension behind and to the sides of all hot appliances.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: A fridge or freezer</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You probably don’t need a full-size fridge outside. An under-counter version will do the trick to chill protein until cook time, while keeping drinks cold. If you have the room, you could enjoy two fridges, one for food and one for beverages. The most common width for under-counter models is 24 inches, but 21- and 18-inch versions, as well as drawers, are available from major commercial fridge makers like Summit. Expect to pay $1,000 to $2,000 (for a double-drawer version)—as much as a grill. Make sure the model you buy is UL-listed and rated food-safe for outdoor use.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: Sinks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A sink, while not mandatory, makes outdoor entertaining much easier. You&#8217;ll be able to rinse hands and wash dishes, so you don’t have to take dirty dishes back into the house, or fill up a water pitcher. You&#8217;ll just need a water line connected to your home water supply, or a hook-up through a hose if you just need cold water. You’ll want weather-resistant 16-gauge stainless-steel for the sink. Then ask yourself, single or double basin? Splurge on a bar station that includes a sink, plus condiment trays, and an insulated ice bucket from Home Depot. Or, supplement your cook station with a modular side burner and sink combo from Master Forge. Wondering about a dishwasher? Demand is low so they are hard to find. Best to rinse dishes in that sink and cart the load to the house to finish inside.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: Lighting</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For comfort and aesthetics, outdoor lighting is a no-brainer. It’s also necessary for safety. As with the indoor kitchen, you want the prep and grill areas well-lit. Dining and seating areas can get by with softer, ambient lighting, but make sure pathways are lit so no one stumbles at night. Your contractor can help you determine the appropriate outdoor options for spotlights focused on task areas, as well as pendant, post, or string lighting to illuminate the dining and lounging areas, and lantern or path lighting for groundcover. Again, you want fixtures made to be operated outdoors, but look for LED versions. This option is preferable because LEDs give off little heat, can handle temperature swings from -40F to 180F, and last up to 10 years or for 100,000 hours of continuous use. You’ll find the widest range of selection at box stores where you can see the lights illuminated to help you decide if you like the effect.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Tip: Keep convenience within reach</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since your contractor is running lines for utilities, ask them to include electrical outlets for small appliances, like a blender, portable stereo, and space heaters. Your contractor will know the correct type of outdoor outlets, which should be ground fault circuit interpreter (GFCI).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cooking on the grill is a great American pastime, whether entertaining friends or feeding your family. Maximize your enjoyment by adding some sizzle to al fresco dining with a beautiful, super-functional outdoor kitchen.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Westchester County </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no doubt that Westchester is a picturesque place to live—the luxury of space and peace with the bustle of New York City a quick trip away. Some recent buyers and established homeowners alike feel it would be even more idyllic if they had their dream kitchen, whether it&#8217;s renovating a new home or fulfilling a long-desired wish to upgrade. The first step is often the stumbling block: determining the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/kitchen-renovation-costs-money-goes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">national average</a> for a basic 200-square-foot kitchen renovation is $63,829.  Westchester County has a slightly higher average <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation cost</a> landing at <strong>$65,651</strong> or <strong>$328 a square foot</strong>, according to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association (NKBA). Let’s break that budget down into bite-sized pieces to help you get closer to your dream cooking and entertaining space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DESIGN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an important line item in your budget, especially if your vision involves a layout change. That could involve moving load-bearing walls and gas lines. The NKBA estimates design fees eat up about four percent of a kitchen remodel cost. Sweeten designer <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, who has done work in Westchester, said it&#8217;s more realistic to put away 15 percent of your budget for design if you’re in the mood for a major layout change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re giving your kitchen more of a makeover than an overhaul, it’s possible to work closely with an experienced general contractor on the design and forgo a designer. Statistics from the NKBA show that the majority of homeowners relied on a general contractor and only 22 percent used a designer. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck</a>, a Sweeten contractor who works in Westchester, has found that many clients in the county take a hands-on approach to design and often don’t use a designer or architect. However, an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect&#8217;s services will be needed</a> if plumbing or gas lines are moving, there are structural changes, or if a landmark property is being renovated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PERMITS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building permits are handled by the building department of each individual town within Westchester County. &#8220;Individual&#8221; is the key word here because methods of calculations can change dramatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Rye, the most of the <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/money/real-estate/homes/2017/03/22/westchester-priciest-zipcodes/99506058/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive</a> area in Southern Westchester—the median price for a home is $1,380,000—it’s no surprise that building permits are calculated based on the cost of a renovation. For every $1,000 in your kitchen remodel budget, that’s an additional $17 for your building permits. That average $64,000 kitchen overhaul will cost at least $1,088 in permits. If plumbing and electrical permits are required, that’s an additional $200 a pop (for a less extensive renovation, these permits may not be necessary).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the township of Peekskill, building permit costs are at the end of a minor mathematical equation. Multiply the square footage of your project by $150. Then, multiply that figure by 0.10. For a 200-square-foot kitchen, that’s $3,000. So take a moment to look at how the building department of your township calculates permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/westchester-county-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-34831 size-full" title="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png" alt="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" width="320" height="60" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png 320w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>APPLIANCES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Village Appliances in Westchester, a budget appliance package (fridge, oven, dishwasher and microwave), can go for under $5,000. However, Joe Gagliardo, the owner of Village Appliances, doesn’t sell too many of those. The majority of customers either go for a package in the $5,000 to $8,000 range or in the mid-price range of $18,000 to $22,000, which will get you brands such as General Electric and Electrolux. The high-end price spectrum will deliver brands such as Viking and Miele for a four-piece suite (fridge, range, hood, and dishwasher) at a price ranging from $17,000 to $26,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At <a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bilotta Kitchens</a>, clients often buy in the $12,000 to $15,000 range for an appliance package, according to senior designer and CKD Randy O’Kane. This will get you brands such as Thermador, Sub-Zero, and Wolf. There’s always room to mix and match, but brands do offer a discount or throw in items like blenders, toasters and hoods for free if you go with the same brand for your appliances, Randy said. “It is the heart and soul of a kitchen,” she said. “Cabinets are great, but it is all about cooking.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation can cost between $500 and $1,000, and that price will depend on how much work your contractor has already done. If water lines have not been run or outlets are not in the necessary areas, that could push up installation costs, Joe said. For those after custom range hoods, then plan for the $2,000 and $8,000 range.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CABINETS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinets and hardware (think handles and knobs) are a big-ticket item on every kitchen remodel cost budget. They typically take up 30 percent of costs, according to NKBA. In a basic kitchen renovation, that’s $6,000. For a major overhaul worth $60,000, cabinets cost almost $20,000. What typically makes a big <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difference in cabinet cost</a> is whether you want custom, pre-fabricated or a mix of both. Something pre-fabricated from IKEA or Home Depot will cost around $130 a linear foot. Custom jobs can shoot up to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear square foot</a>. However, with that higher price, there is more freedom in deciding your kitchen layout. You can also get <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a> with custom cabinets. Semi-custom cabinets generally are about 50 percent cheaper than full custom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or do what Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill did in her own kitchen renovation: the recycled customized option. &#8220;I scoured Renovation Angel&#8217;s website and purchased a used-but-high-end kitchen for about $10,000, which is what I could have spent on cabinets alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A complete kitchen included appliances and cabinetry.&#8221; Jean then customized the cabinets to fit her space, which often meant filler panels were wider on one side than the other, or building a soffit was necessary. &#8220;It was like working on a jigsaw puzzle in order to make the kitchen look like it fit in the space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I was okay with these kinds of imperfections in exchange for essentially getting a premium kitchen on an Ikea type of budget.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>COUNTERTOPS</strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.westchesterkitchenandbath.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester Kitchen and Bath</a>, quartz is overwhelmingly the most popular countertop, according to showroom manager and designer Donna Magnotta. “It’s heat-, stain-, scratch-, and bacteria-resistant,” she said, “and it&#8217;s maintenance-free.” Natural stones, like marble, need routine staining and sealing. Quartz starts around $85 per linear foot and is on the mid to high-end of the price scale, which includes the cost of fabricating and installing. Laminate starts at $20 a linear foot, but is rarely purchased, Donna said. Granite is next up the ladder at about $35 a linear foot. On the high end, natural stones start at about $120 a linear foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LIGHTING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kitchen lighting isn’t a big budget line item. It takes up on four percent of total costs on average. The end price, of course, will always be determined by your tastes. In a $20,000 kitchen, that’s only $800. For a major remodel in the $60,000 range, lighting costs look closer to $2,400.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PLUMBING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On an average remodel, plumbing costs are about the same at $800. If there is a layout change to your Westchester kitchen, then that will likely add to your plumbing costs, which also includes gas lines. And the more you alter the basic layout of your space, the more your kitchen remodel cost will increase for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting, and inspections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FLOORING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a budget, Westchester’s <a href="https://suburbanfloors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suburban Floors</a> has a vinyl Karndean-Knight Tile that is $3.50 a square foot that is “still very durable and stylish,” said Emily Carpentieri, the store’s owner. The price per square foot does not include installation. On the higher end is cork or wide-plank wood flooring. These go for $8.25 to $15 a square foot. But vinyl floors in the $5 to $7 range is Suburban Floors’ biggest seller. “These would blow your mind how real they looked,” said Emily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LABOR AND INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction labor can change depending upon your Westchester zip code. The costs are less expensive the further you are from NYC. For Peekskill, labor costs are 22 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr.com</a>. Dobbs Ferry comes in at 40 percent higher and Croton-on-Hudson at 27 percent higher than the national average. The kitchen renovation cost in Rye could have a labor budget 55 percent above the national average. To compare, the labor cost for a kitchen renovation on the Upper East Side is 77 percent higher than the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t forget installation for appliances, cabinetry, plumbing, and electrical. These typically take about 17 percent of a budget, which is about $3,500 for an average kitchen. And as mentioned above, factor in $500 to $1,000 for appliance installation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, renovations are like fingerprints<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no two are alike. That includes their budgets. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator in Westchester allocated their $56,620 renovation budget:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/westchesterkitchen-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25369 mb-24 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation cost" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/westchesterkitchen-1-723x506.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation cost" width="723" height="506" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike a kitchen <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island</a>, which has clearance on all sides, a peninsula is joined to the rest of the kitchen, often meeting with a nearby counter or wall to transform an L-shape layout into a much more functional U-shape. It&#8217;s a popular choice among homeowners who don’t have enough space for an island—three feet all around is normally required for comfortable clearance—or prefer to have a more cohesive kitchen layout. It’s also a great way to create visual separation between two spaces in an open plan apartment. You can take the delineation one step further by defining different functions for each side of the peninsula—<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> and prep space on one side and seating on the other. Below, a look at five homeowners, each with a one-of-a-kind kitchen peninsula.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22215 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua’s kitchen</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Removing the wall between the kitchen and dining room in Erica and Joshua’s apartment greatly improved the usability of the space. In order to find a compromise between Joshua’s preference for an open plan layout and Erica’s desire to maintain some visual privacy between rooms, a peninsula was built in the kitchen to divide it from the dining area. It was designed with generous storage on both sides in the form of drawers and a cabinet on one end. With bar seating for three, and a gooseneck sconce illuminating one end, the peninsula is the perfect spot to dine or sit down with a laptop. It’s also a good size with plenty of surface space, allowing the couple to use it at the same time—cooking and working face-to-face.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to swap out the awkwardly placed island in their small kitchen, Meredith and Jason’s Sweeten general contractor suggested that they go with a wide peninsula. “As soon as I saw the drawing, I was on board with it,” said Meredith. The new kitchen peninsula doubles counter space while providing a spot for the microwave—<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tucking it out of sight</a>—and plenty of deep drawers for storage. Plus, bar seating on the side facing the dining room allows Meredith to do some work and keep Jason company while he cooks. The white waterfall counter makes it an attractive statement piece as you walk in the front door.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23095 mt-24 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/apartment-party-four-five/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam and Sean’s kitchen</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sam and Sean wanted to make their kitchen feel as large as possible, so a big island was out of the question. Instead, a small peninsula was installed to provide additional prep space and storage while adding some separation between the kitchen and main living area. The custom area was topped with butcher block to create contrast with the white Caesarstone counters used in the rest of the kitchen. Designed with three sides and three distinct purposes in mind, the kitchen peninsula is well-equipped with drawers on one side, bar seating for two on the other, and shelving for storing books on the end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24134 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="3744" height="5616" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg 3744w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3744px) 100vw, 3744px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-remodel-breaks-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emily and Trey’s kitchen</a> in downtown Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening up Emily and Trey’s cramped kitchen by taking down walls and removing the loft storage above it gave the couple plenty of room to work with. To make the most of the newly opened space, a wide L-shaped peninsula with a Carrara marble countertop was installed with bar seating along one side—quickly becoming a popular spot for Emily’s two kids to hang out while she cooks. Placing the kitchen sink in the peninsula was an ideal location since it faced the windows with lots of natural light and allowed ease of conversation with the family in the living area. The white column holding the intercom could not be moved, so the Sweeten contractor integrated it into the structure, transforming it into a cool architectural element.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-14_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25062 mt-24 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="681" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000-300x204.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000-600x409.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-henrys-east-village-condo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henry’s kitchen</a> in the West Village, Manhattan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Henry saw the potential to connect his kitchen and living room and took advantage of it, taking down a wall between the rooms and replacing it with a peninsula. Adding this structure extended his kitchen’s L-shape into a more functional and versatile U-shape. Beyond expanding storage and prep space, the main attraction is the range, placed in the center, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hood</a> overhead, making it a more sociable spot from which to cook. As a bonus, Henry tucked a front-loading <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">washer and dryer</a> underneath the peninsula, making them both easily accessible from the living room. That&#8217;s one hard-working peninsula!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Custom kitchen islands are design puzzle pieces that&#8217;ll help meet your kitchen&#8217;s needs</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It could be the convenient location, often the center of the kitchen, or how inviting it looks—a perfect spot to sit down with a cup of coffee and newspaper, or glass of wine. When family and friends come together, it’s a place to collaborate, prep dishes, and socialize. And so it makes sense to design the kitchen island as functional, versatile, and personalized as possible. Depending on how you want to use your space, it can provide storage—think, one large <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinet</a>—a work surface, or serve as a transition between two living areas. Below, we explore 5 custom kitchen islands designed for Sweeten homeowners.</p>
<h3>A kitchen island with waterfall counter</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24402 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/becky-kitchen-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becky and Sarah’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kitchen island and waterfall counter</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a small kitchen, you might think that you don’t have enough room for a kitchen island. Sarah wasn’t sure her space could pull it off. Thankfully, her Sweeten contractor thought otherwise and came up with a design that suited the space. With pull-out drawers on one side, and custom walnut paneling from Semihandmade on the other, which faces the dining area. Topped with a beautiful white waterfall counter, it not only adds storage but becomes the focal point of the kitchen. This extra storage allowed Becky and Sarah to be more adventurous with another <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinet</a> decision: skipping the upper line entirely for open shelving.</span></p>
<h3>A half-height wall-turned-island</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24403 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01-723x496.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="723" height="496" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/before-after-kaija-and-johns-prospect-heights-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaija and John’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wall-turned-kitchen-island</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When there’s a wall separating the cookspace from the rest of your living area, you have a few options. You can keep the wall, introduce a cut-out to join it to the rest of the space, or take the wall down. There’s also a fourth option: cut the wall in half and add a countertop. That’s what the previous owner did, and although the first draft of the kitchen island didn’t meet their standards, Kaija and John realized that a true island would benefit existing storage, prep, and dining options. A new, custom-built island with deep drawers and a poured concrete countertop transformed the look and feel of the kitchen.</span></p>
<h3>A dining table so chic, you won&#8217;t notice it&#8217;s an island</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24404 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/john-and-katharines-sweetened-manhattan-apartment-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John and Katharine’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kitchen island, which doubles as a dining table</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have a kitchen joined with your living room, it can be difficult to make the spaces work as one without making sacrifices. Instead of swapping out a kitchen island for a dining table, or vice versa, John and Katharine wanted a central island in their kitchen to function as both a work space and a place to eat. They also needed a spot to hide their microwave. After discovering that Wolf makes a unit that opens up like a drawer and can be loaded from the top, rather than the front, the microwave found a home in the island. An overlapping countertop in blue-green soapstone stands out as a beautiful centerpiece, maximizing prep space while allowing the couple to dine comfortably.</p>
<h3>A moveable kitchen island (on wheels!)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_ClaireKitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24406 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_ClaireKitchen-04-723x495.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="723" height="495" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/claire-mikes-park-slope-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claire and Mike’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movable kitchen island<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_ClaireKitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24405 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_ClaireKitchen-03-723x1075.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="723" height="1075" /></a>A close-up of the kitchen island on wheels</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a kitchen that’s deemed too small or tight for a kitchen island, the solution is a movable one that can move out of the way when it’s not in use. To replace a butcher block that was too big for the space, Claire and Mike designed a custom piece that was more flexible. With the need for more storage and prep space on their <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wishlist</a>, and with not much room to spare, their Sweeten contractor put the new kitchen island on wheels so that it could sit against the wall or roll into the center of the kitchen.</p>
<h3>A chef&#8217;s best friend: an island for entertaining</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24407 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/steve-upper-east-side-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve and Lauren’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kitchen island with ample bar seating<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For passionate chefs who enjoy cooking and hosting dinners at home, it’s important to keep countertops clear. With the objectives of opening up their kitchen and maximizing prep areas, Steve and Lauren designed a kitchen island that doubled their counter space while adding extra storage below. By choosing a two-tiered island with counter-height on the side facing the interior of the kitchen and bar-height on the side facing the rest of the apartment, the island became dual purpose as a place to cook and easily entertain.</span></p>

<p>Custom kitchen islands can make a big impact on your space, but smaller changes can also increase storage and improve organization.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">From open shelves to a liquor cabinet with a garage-style door, these storage ideas can transform your kitchen (or closet!) into a fabulous home bar</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" title="white kitchen-recessed-lights"  class="alignnone wp-image-22989 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg" alt="white kitchen with recessed lights and white cabinets along with white door and knob after renovation" width="723" height="481" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When friends come over, the first thing you do is offer them a glass of wine. That means locating the bottle of wine before heading to where the glasses are usually stored. Finally, you root through the silverware and odds-and-ends drawers until you triumphantly unearth the corkscrew. Sound familiar? Rather than storing bar essentials around the kitchen, these Sweeten homeowners opted for home bar solutions to store everything from glasses to bottles of wine, liquor, cocktail shakers, and more. Plus, homeowners Yi Tyng and Maxime even transformed a closet located directly across from their kitchen into a wine bar (and it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/the-closet-as-workspace-bedroom-or-bar.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured in <em>The New York Times</em></a>). We’ll drink to that!</span></p>
<h3>Got an empty shelf niche? Add home bar hardware to keep stemware closeby</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22998 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-04" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/holly-kitchen-bath-renovation-greenwich-village/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holly and Christian’s</a> kitchen in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This clever use of niche shelf space is an excellent way to store wine, cocktail, and champagne glasses so that they can dry quickly and always be within reach for a celebratory toast.</span></p>
<h3>Floating shelves showcase stemware and spirits</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22996 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_DanKitchen-04" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan and Mike’s</a> kitchen in Hell’s Kitchen, Manhattan.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Balancing a run of lower cabinets, a few open shelves act as a home bar dedicated to glassware and bar favorites make it easy to whip up drinks for company. And why not make it a home for cookbooks and cocktail recipes, too?</span></p>
<h3>Using slivers of cabinet space for bottle storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LKR_2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22990 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LKR_2-723x1089.jpg" alt="LKR_2" width="723" height="1089" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisa’s</a> kitchen in Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you have wine, one popular way to store the bottles is on their side so that the corks don’t dry out and let air in. A custom nook with grooved edges is the perfect solution.</span></p>
<h3>Stacking shelves above a wine fridge creates a home bar nook</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23118 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22" width="723" height="482" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frans and Dalal&#8217;s</a> studio kitchen in Gramercy Park, Manhattan.</p>
<p class="p1">Every inch in a studio apartment should be utilized to its full potential. By using the placement of the wine fridge as the base for a custom bar, these homeowners were able to add a countertop and shelving to store their home bar essentials and glassware in one easy-to-locate spot.</p>
<h3 class="p1">A cupboard under the stairs becomes space for spirits<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN-Wine-Bar.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23074 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN-Wine-Bar-723x964.jpg" alt="SWEETEN-Wine-Bar" width="723" height="964" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yi Tyng and Maxime&#8217;s</a> wine bar closet on the Upper West Side, Manhattan.</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">This closet, located under the stairs and directly across from the homeowners&#8217; galley kitchen, was transformed into a wine (and espresso) bar complete with open shelving, a wine fridge, and a counter with bar stools. The space also doubles as a breakfast nook.</p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">A garage-style door cleverly conceals cocktail-making gear<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" title="white kitchen-recessed-lights"  class="alignnone wp-image-22989 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg" alt="white kitchen with recessed lights and white cabinets along with white door and knob after renovation" width="723" height="481" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/katie-elliots-williamsburg-townhouse-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katie and Elliot’s</a> kitchen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have a larger collection, a custom bar cabinet with shelving for glassware and bottles can keep everything neatly organized. This one also boasts a sliding garage-style door so you can choose whether or not to display the goods based on your mood.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/00_COVER-2.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10524" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/00_COVER-2.png" alt="00_COVER-2" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/00_COVER-2.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/00_COVER-2-585x390.png 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/00_COVER-2-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Here at Sweeten, we understand that pairing the correct architect and client is more than circumstantial, and that the best working relationships are based largely on shared visions and philosophies. This <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/portfolios/448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chelsea gut renovation</a> project brought together Sweeten member firm Future Project, co-owned by Pedro Pachano and Ampara Vollert, who specialize in exploring theories of space and sensory discovery in their architecture, with an art collector client who wanted more than just a space to showcase her individual art pieces. The art-loving homeowner was looking for something that would act as a flexible framework for her entire collection and lifestyle.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The apartment&#8217;s original layout was made up of a number of smaller rooms that varied in floor height, which did not allow for two key aspects that the homeowner specified for her remodeled home: to be able to entertain large numbers of people, and to have significant wall space for her collected works.<span id="more-10514"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10516" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg" alt="01_living" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">By removing a series of interior walls, integrating a diffused lighting system that creates flattering light for the homeowner&#8217;s many dinner parties, and using wide plank, white washed maple flooring and continuous, white walls and surface planes, the renovated apartment can now be experienced as an expansive space that is punctuated with art and views of the city.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10517" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg" alt="02_kitchen-entrance" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, Pedro and Ampara created a similarly expansive yet more personalized experience by using materials that engage both the senses of vision and touch. Here, custom, white Corian cabinets create uniform planes which are even used to hide the appliances, and a nice plus is that the Corian panels are pleasant to the touch. Knowing the homeowner&#8217;s propensity to entertain, the Future Project team designed a custom cantilevered island. The island is topped with an ocean blue resin surface like the countertop and backsplash which creates visual depth in the space and “relaxes the eye.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10518" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg" alt="03_family" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10519" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg" alt="04_family-2" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Discovery&#8221; was a theme Future Project worked with in their design, and we love how they used this idea here in the den area with this unique paneled wall system. The polished Rosewood veneer panels open to reveal a series of interior spaces, each with its own color of polished lacquer paint and unique function. One door leads to a guest bathroom, another to a roll-out closet system, and the one above opens to a colorful custom bar installation by a contemporary artist.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10536" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg" alt="bath" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;s a peek into the guest bath, one of our favorite rooms in the apartment. This space features a custom vanity and shower construction made of grey Corian with mirrored edges which make for a unique, fragmented optical illusion.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10520" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg" alt="05_master-bath" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The master bathroom is equally blue and oceanic. The walls, floor and ceiling here are tiled in 1&#8243; <a href="https://www.glasstile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oceanside Tessera glass mosaic tiles</a>, and the vanity is custom in white Thassos marble.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10521" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg" alt="06_bedroom" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Because she entertains so frequently, the homeowner wanted the option of a guest room, but at the same time did not want to give up her home&#8217;s open, gallery-like quality. Pedro and Ampara came up with a smart solution to accommodate both needs with a custom sliding wall (for separation) and second bed that&#8217;s all stored beneath the master bed.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10522" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png" alt="08_double-wine-hallway" width="600" height="428" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">As if we needed any further proof, this homeowner&#8217;s wine closet is yet another testament to her hostessing skills &#8212; so, when&#8217;s the next party?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Great work and many thanks to Future Project&#8217;s Pedro and Ampara for sharing their work with us; we look forward to seeing more from these designers, soon!</p>
