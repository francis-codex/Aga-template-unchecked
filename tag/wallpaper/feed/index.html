<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>A ranch-style Georgia home with appeal</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We bought this 1958 home in Atlanta’s Buckhead section with plans to renovate right away. Nothing was wrong, per se, but we knew we wanted to remodel. The plan was to improve the layout and exterior façade and update the kitchen and bathrooms. A big project would also turn the primary bedroom into a true master suite.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21.jpg" alt="Den with fireplace, couches, chairs, grand piano, and hanging fan" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52190" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are Jenna and Hagan, now parents to two daughters: Clay, 2, and Sloan, 7 months. Henry, our dog, lives here, too. When we found the house, we were still expecting our second child and I was working from home due to the pandemic. More space and some rooms to relax in were all we could think about.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>A mid-century remodel focused on good bones with potential</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Our ranch-style home, in the Chastain Park neighborhood, comprises 3,000 square feet. It has a backyard with mature trees, and the house benefits from pretty views and lots of natural light. The interior was traditionally styled, and we liked it. We felt, however, that we could make it work better for our family, and set out to do that. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and the team quickly sourced four quality contractors for us to consider. We soon <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6751#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a general contractor</a> who inspired our confidence. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23.jpg" alt="A view of the white painted brick fireplace from behind the tan couch" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52192" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22.jpg" alt="The grand piano in the renovated den with a large plant" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52191" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We brought floorplans to our meetings, as layout changes were the most challenging part of the project. Our house had a lot of storage space that we saw a potential to put to better use. These would include the bedroom areas as well as more useful spaces for the kitchen area.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the den, our contractor removed a large built-in shelf that had started to separate from the wall. We also painted this room and stained the floor dark brown.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20.jpg" alt="View into the two doors to the living areas from the entryway" width="1000" height="1545" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52189" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20-194x300.jpg 194w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20-583x900.jpg 583w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">&#8220;The contractor replaced the windows top to bottom to improve insulation. We could see early signs of rotting wood in the old windows.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A new bay window brightens the kitchen</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The plan for the kitchen included putting in a bay window in the existing breakfast nook and installing Dolomite marble countertops. We ordered a new kitchen sink and added a subway tile backsplash. We kept the existing cabinets, switching out the knobs for a fast refresh. To increase function in this section of the house, we turned to old closets. Opening up the boxed-in space of the four lining the back hallway made space for a butler’s pantry with a second fridge. We also built a laundry room in this area in a follow-up to the larger renovation. </span></p>

<h3>Transforming closets for a master suite</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the back of the house, closets (again) and one of the offices gave their square footage to enlarge our master suite and another bedroom. For the master suite, we imagined a large, open bedroom area looking out into the backyard. We would also add a walk-in closet, a big bathroom, and a powder room. The remap worked brilliantly. An existing door was repurposed as a sliding barn door and leads to our master walk-in closet. The contractor built a secret door at its back that lets us quickly get to the kids’ bedrooms during the night. It has come in handy!</span></p>

<h3 class="p4">Three bathrooms with new tile</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bathroom renovations came next. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/how-to-save-on-home-remodeling-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We did them economically</a>—as in almost simultaneously. Each bath got new tile, though we retained usable fixtures and hardware</span><span class="s1"> where we could. At one point, we had three bathrooms torn up. The one in use had a shower only, and our two-year-old was terrified of showers! We were pleased when the child’s bathroom, replete with new tub and penny tile floor, was finished—not to mention the other three. Our beautiful master bath, with a freestanding fluted bathtub, a glass-walled shower, and double sinks got the full marble treatment. The color palette was a mix of gray and white, including sleek large-sheet floor tiles</span><span class="s1">. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15.jpg" alt="Bathroom with light blue walls, white floors, white shower curtain, and decorative mirror" width="1000" height="668" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52186" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Whole-house improvements for curb appeal</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Much of the house had hardwood flooring in need of refinishing. From the bedrooms to the living room, den, foyer, and kitchen, the contractors sanded and stained them. In another global redo, the contractor replaced the windows top to bottom to improve insulation. We could see early signs of rotting wood in the old windows. The new kitchen bay window </span><span class="s1">looks great from the inside and <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/curb-appeal-goes-a-long-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhances the home’s curb appeal</a>. The house would also get a new coat of exterior paint. </span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A Sweeten general contractor to count on</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Through it all, our Sweeten contractor was reliable and competent. He was diligent with the permitting process, a delay-ridden challenge during Covid. (Key takeaway: Be 100 percent sure you need a permit and factor it into your timeline!) Our contractor was transparent on costs, and his efforts resulted in a pleasing final product.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It’s been a feat, but finally, we feel settled. Jenna and I waited so long for our master suite—it feels magical to have our own space. The girls, and Henry the dog, are happy. We are home.</span></p>

<h2>No space? No problem! Get inspired by these small entryway ideas by Sweeten</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41912" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it: the entryway is the first space—and the last—everyone sees in your home. It&#8217;s a perfect space for making a statement, and it deserves a careful balance of form and function. Regardless of your usable square footage, there are great options for style and utility improvements in even the smallest of entryways. Here, we highlight 5 design-forward small entryway ideas by Sweeten contractors.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> <span class="s1">matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Idea 1: Enlarge a small entryway area</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44263" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg" alt="foyer" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39880" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12.jpg" alt="foyer" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For an 1,800-square-foot apartment in Manhattan&#8217;s Upper West Side, a couple hired architect Jessica Wetters to help reimagine the space. It was a full-gut renovation of the kitchen, master bedroom, living area, and bathroom, as well as <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/family-remodel-design-forward-apartment/"><span class="s2">the entry area.</span></a> The entry was a relatively simple job, since they were gutting the rest of the house, but it brought outsized benefits: a great first impression, an enlarged space to fit a comfortable bench, and a floating shelf for essentials.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Laura and Randy put an offer on their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/"><span class="s2">Upper East Side co-op</span></a>, they envisioned an all-new, more functional layout. Central to the plan was the small entryway. &#8220;We knew we wanted to extend the entryway as it was incredibly narrow with two closets on either side of the front door,&#8221; Laura said. &#8220;We decided to keep the larger walk-in and remove the smaller one, to create a place that was pretty but also functional.&#8221; The couple completed the statement with stunning, geometric-patterned wallpaper</span>.</p>
<h3>Idea 2: Use wallpaper to make a statement</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43738" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05.jpg" alt="wallpaper foyer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41440" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jessica and Alex had rented for six years before buying an <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/long-time-renters-shine-as-renovating-homeowners/"><span class="s2">800-square-foot co-op</span></a> in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Although they were thrilled to finally own a home, they knew the apartment would need work before feeling like their home. They remodeled the galley kitchen and the bathroom and reconfigured a few closets. They also gave the entryway some attention, with carefully chosen wallpaper to make a visual statement. &#8220;The subtle raffia gives texture and depth to the walls,&#8221; said Jessica. &#8220;We chose materials that would stand the test of time from both an aesthetic and durability standpoint.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For media executive Jenifer Herrmann and her partner Mitzie Wong (co-founder of creative design firm <a href="https://roarandrabbit.com/"><span class="s2">Roar + Rabbit),</span></a> wallpaper was likewise the way to make a statement in their newly renovated <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/"><span class="s2">entryway.</span></a> They added Rhye wallpaper in hand foil and completed the look with a round mirror from <a href="https://www.serenaandlily.com/"><span class="s2">Serena &amp; Lily </span></a>and a console from <a href="https://www.westelm.com/"><span class="s2">West Elm—</span></a>elements that complemented their nature theme.</span></p>
<h3>Idea 3: Combine function + design accents</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41693" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40969" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="1501" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tina, a designer, and her husband Andrew wished they had entryway storage for shoes and coats. When they planned a complete renovation of their  <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/"><span class="s2">1930s co-op</span></a> in Sunnyside, New York, they had to contend with tight space constraints in the entryway. Since they couldn&#8217;t enlarge the space, they used their imaginations to maximize the space, combining form with function. They added a small bench, along with hooks for bags and coats, all set against a shiplap background. &#8220;We love the clean lines and texture of details of the shiplap,&#8221; said Tina.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Erin and Chris, their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-homecoming-hudson-heights/"><span class="s2">three-bedroom, two-bath co-op</span></a> in a post-war, 1950s building also lacked storage at the entry. To remedy, they installed a bench with storage bins underneath and overhead. For finishing touches they added wicker baskets, a floating shelf, and a metal-framed mirror to the adjacent wall</span>.</p>
<h3>Idea 4: Add a statement piece</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41912" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After renting for many years, John wanted to start building equity. He bought a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/murray-hill-full-apartment-renovation/"><span class="s2">1,200-square-foot apartment</span></a> on Park Avenue in New York City, with gorgeous views of the skyline. He enlisted architect <a href="https://aurorafarewell.com/"><span class="s2">Aurora Farewell</span></a> to help improve the layout and add professional touches, to make the space feel cohesive and thoughtfully designed. For the entryway, he wanted a sense of drama. He and the architect chose a large round mirror to cover most of the wall, above a minimalistic, multifunction wood bench</span>.</p>
<h3>Idea 5: Make the entryway space do double duty</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50508 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/">Chris and Jeremy</a></span><span class="s2"> had hoped to renovate sometime in the distant future. Then, water damage from a leaky apartment above required immediate attention, inspiring them to go beyond repairs and jump into a larger renovation. In addition to the bathroom, they remodeled their kitchen and living areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">They also knew the foyer presented an interesting opportunity. It was large enough to feel like wasted spaces if they left it empty, but too small for any obvious uses. Their Sweeten general contractor helped them find an imaginative solution. &#8220;We decided on a full-height bookcase that’s only 8-inches deep. It holds loads more than we expected,&#8221; said Jeremy. &#8220;On the opposite side, our general contractor fitted narrow custom cabinets to serve as a bar.&#8221; Art lights hang over tall mirrors, giving a classic gallery sensibility</span>.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Guest post by homeowner Michelle</em></p>
<h3>Finding the right contractors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My journey down the renovation rabbit hole began when I found myself picturing the dilapidated garage in the backyard as my dream “diva den,” as my best friend calls it. While researching different designs and models, I remembered an article on Sweeten I&#8217;d read a few years ago and had always wanted to use their services. It seemed like a no-brainer to have an intermediary help locate vetted contractors. It also solved the huge question of where to begin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since this was my first ever renovation project, I had no idea what my renovation would cost. Sweeten helped me modify my scope of work and nail down a realistic budget. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced me to a few contractors</a> who were a good match for my project. I finally felt like I had a team behind me, which is great once you start writing big checks.</p>

<h3>Planning the &#8220;she shed&#8221; garage remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I knew instantly that the first Sweeten contractor I met was the right fit for the job. Finally, I found someone as excited about my garage as I was! At that stage, I only had a basic idea of what I wanted. We took down most of the existing structure, retaining only the foundation. Since I was renovating a 12&#8242; x 19&#8242; garage, I wanted the interior to be basic and for the structure to retain the identity and functionality of a garage. That meant concrete floors, no molding, and a statement-making garage door. If you took out the rugs and furniture of the she shed, the structure could have use as a garage or workspace. I also wanted a calming space with one stipulation: no white walls.</p>
<h3>Experiencing a real-life renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with everyone on my contractor’s team was amazing. I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way. Most importantly, nobody exposed me for the complete novice that I was. Gaining an understanding of how everything worked also helped reign in some of my design ideas. To top off the contractor’s great service, he downloaded WhatsApp to stay in touch with me when I left for Cuba mid-project. I greatly appreciated his dedication to my peace of mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather was one of the biggest challenges during my project. It wasn’t an issue when my project started in August. However, when November arrived, it was either too cold, too rainy, or was supposed to rain but didn’t. Either way, there were a few bad weather days that halted work on The Shak. My contractor also had to juggle other clients. In my naiveté, I thought contractors worked on one project at a time. I came to understand that The Shak was my highest priority, but contractors work on other dream projects at the same time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25862 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-07-09.gif" alt="ladder to garage attic" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>Building a ladder to the attic</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the exterior took shape, and the interior work began, I became more involved in the project. That is also when my attention to detail heightened. For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage, we utilized the space</a>, we utilized the space above the ceiling. How to access that space became an hour-long discussion. I asked the contractor and his partner how I would get up to the storage space. &#8220;Use a ladder,&#8221; they said. &#8220;That’s what I do in my garage.&#8221; I’m no mathematician, but a nine-foot-tall ceiling plus a five-foot-tall girl does not equal easy movement of big boxes up a six-foot ladder. And where would I keep this ladder when I wasn’t using it? After a bit of selling on my part, they agreed to install an attic ladder. It was worth hashing out and in the end, my contractors loved the ladder too.</p>
<blockquote><p>I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Personalizing the &#8220;she shed&#8221; bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It may sound weird, but finding my dry-flush toilet was exciting. The she shed did not seem usable to me if you had to keep going into the house to use the bathroom. After endlessly searching for a toilet that did not need to be hooked up to sewage lines or have an odor, I came across a dry flush toilet. It is a great invention. It works like a Diaper Genie disposal system with a continuous bag that self-seals when “flushed,” then, a new portion of the bag opens for use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the bathroom is a small 3’ x 4’ space, I definitely wanted some over-the-top designs on the walls. I initially thought of using three-dimensional self-adhesive wall panels but decided against that since I wanted a mix of color and patterns. As a naturally curly-haired girl, the print I chose was a perfect fit for my preference of streamlined chaos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25844 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg" alt="garage bathroom remodel" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A tip on DIY wallpaper hanging</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, by the time I found the mural, the contractors had completed the interior space. So, my best friend and I enrolled in the university that is YouTube. After watching about twenty videos, we felt qualified to hang wallpaper, something neither of us had ever done before. I love what we accomplished, but some things take more skill and patience than she or I possess. I will never hang wallpaper again.</p>
<h3>Ultra-bold backsplash tiles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the contractor installed the sink and countertop, my <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next big project was the backsplash</a>. I wanted something different and eye-catching, something that would not bore me. I came across graffiti tiles but the designs weren&#8217;t bold enough. After feeling empowered with my new construction knowledge, I decided to decoupage my own tiles. We figured out the dimensions for the backsplash and measured out 5&#8242; x 2&#8242; worth of decoupage tiles as well as some purchased ones. It is one of my favorite things in The Shak. Now, when my friends come over, they all choose their favorite tile. I love how they invite interaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have never embarked on a project of this size. At times, it was scary. I would get a call at 8 a.m. from my contractor, asking <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which direction I wanted the French doors</a> to open or what size I wanted the windows to be, with no clue of how to respond. My advice to anyone starting a project would be to pick a contractor that listens to your ideas. It is also helpful to watch some YouTube videos, home improvement shows, or however else you like to educate yourself. The more a homeowner knows, the better he or she can direct the construction of their masterpiece. I couldn&#8217;t be happier with everything I accomplished in making The Shak a reality.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">More and more designers, contractors and homeowners believe that one of the best ways to make a bold design statement is to opt for wallpaper over paint. It provides hundreds of looks and textures that a regular paint job can&#8217;t match. And while more expensive than traditional paint,  wallpaper is usually less expensive than hiring a painter to create a decorative surface. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, </span><span class="s2">shows why this covering is gaining in popularity.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Improved techniques</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although wallpaper has been around for years, there are a few reasons for its resurgence in popularity.  For one, people who grew up with it in their homes may have soured on it, but thanks to new printing and manufacturing techniques, manufacturers are producing dozens of new colors, designs, and textures, sparking a renewed appreciation for the product.  &#8220;Wallpaper has become much more interesting, &#8221; said Sweeten designer<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tina. &#8220;It&#8217;s not your grandmother&#8217;s wallpaper anymore. Even if you are going for a minimalist look, a textured wallpaper adds so much more than flat paint to a room.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Homeowners are increasingly asking for wallpaper in their homes. Tina tells how one of her clients already had wallpaper picked out for one of the rooms before they even met to discuss the project. &#8220;People are much more receptive than they used to be,&#8221; said Tina &#8221; One reason may be that they see so many design ideas on the internet where in the past you could only see ideas in magazines. There was no option to see the world quickly.&#8221; </span></p>

<p>(<em>Above</em>) Jessica + Alex&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/long-time-renters-shine-as-renovating-homeowners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">textured wallcovering</a>; Brooke + Sam added <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/renovating-a-brooklyn-duplex-in-time-for-the-baby-naming-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor-to-ceiling patterns</a> to both bathrooms</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of the types of designs that are getting noticed include 3D papers where the design seems to pop off of the wall, gradient papers where the colors and designs transition from floor to ceiling, metal looks, and geometric shapes. Custom printed options are also available. There are services that allow you to upload a photo or some other design you&#8217;ve created and have it turned into wallpaper.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Where to use wallpaper</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most designers use it in the main living areas: living room, dining room, and bedrooms. Some use it on an accent wall to make a bold statement. Others cover all of the walls, some even use it on ceilings. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The use of wallpaper in bathrooms is a matter of contention among designers and contractors. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to use it in full bathrooms because of the moisture problems,&#8221; said Sweeten contractor Ilya. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen people put it in the shower area. I personally would not do that.&#8221; It should be noted that some wallpapers are designed for use in high-moisture areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ilya has used wallpaper in powder rooms. In a recent remodel in Red Hook, the client &#8220;chose a bold print wallpaper that brings the whole space to life,&#8221; he said. The wallpaper has a white background with a large green floral print. The powder room has matte back accessories. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Designer Tina does not use it in bathrooms because she prefers to utilize tile that runs up to the ceiling. &#8220;But I do like it in powder rooms to create a jewel-box effect,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Working with wallpaper</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another reason for the increased popularity is that today&#8217;s products are easier to work with than older versions. &#8220;It&#8217;s still an art form to hang wallpaper correctly,&#8221; said Ilya. &#8220;But it is easier than it used to be and it is also easier to match patterns.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Depending on the product, wallpaper comes prepasted, and soaking the sheets in water activates the adhesive. Another method is to apply adhesive to the paper or directly to the wall. Spreading adhesive on the wall tends to be less messy than brushing it on the back of the paper and then transferring the sheet to the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many papers are listed as strippable or peelable, meaning it is easy to get them off of the walls when it is time for a change. Ilya says that when you do remove the wallpaper, it is necessary to skim coat the walls before painting. If new wallpaper is called for, you should remove all of the old adhesive and prime the wall. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Types of wallpaper</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wallpaper is made from a number of materials, but some form of vinyl is the most common. The material is durable, easy to keep clean, and many vinyl papers are easy to remove. There are a number of products that contain vinyl in some way.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Solid vinyl &#8211; This thick paper consists of a solid layer of vinyl laminated to a paper or fabric substrate. This is the most durable of vinyl-containing products.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Vinyl coated fabric &#8211; Liquid vinyl coats a fabric base, making the paper breathable.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Vinyl coated paper &#8211; A liquid coating is applied to a paper base. These papers are easy to clean and remove, but not as durable as a solid vinyl paper.<br />
</span></li>

<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Non-woven paper &#8211; This is a combination of natural and synthetic materials similar to those used in making tea bags and coffee filters. It is durable, washable, tear-resistant, and breathable.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Grasscloth &#8211; Natural materials like hemp or seagrass are woven with cotton and attached to a natural backing. These papers offer striking designs, but they are difficult to hang and keep clean. Best for low traffic areas.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Flock wallpaper &#8211; In this product, a material, such as wool or rayon, is applied to an adhesive backing, creating a raised design. The distinctive designs are difficult to clean and best left to low-traffic areas like bedrooms and formal living rooms.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Metallic wallpaper &#8211; These foil products contain aluminum or some other metal added to the surface of the paper. Available in solid metallic colors, such as gold, brass, and copper or in geometric and other designs. Some of these metallic papers require a specialized application.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wallpaper, even a small installation, can go a long way. With its various patterns, colors, and tactile designs, consider it as a decorative accessory that lends a pop of texture. </span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>We’re back again this week with Part 2 of Nazli and Larry’s historic Brooklyn brownstone renovation in Bedford-Stuyvesant. If you missed it—check out <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part I</a></i></span><span class="s1"><i> where Nazli walked us through their planning process and showed off the foyer and guest suite. Here, she shows off the rest of the parlor floor, including the kitchen, the dining room, and the powder room. Nazli explains the challenge of merging modern and traditional within the confines of a townhouse’s long and narrow configuration. Read on for her thoughts on powder rooms (wackiness is key), decorative mantels (rather pointless), and coming to terms with the budget required to achieve the renovation you want (very tough).</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think the biggest challenge to any renovation is…the renovators obviously. There will always be a push and pull between the architect, the contractor, and the owners. And most of the time, that will yield a better product than any single entity could have envisioned (but not always). I think our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect was fantastic</a> in coming up with some great solutions to space challenges–especially on the parlor floor, where I insisted we needed a half-bath that was nowhere near the kitchen (because, gross), a hall closet, and a kitchen pantry. She really provided a lot of help in making sure the house was up to code and that the spaces flowed. Our contractor (and my husband’s best friend), did an awesome job of value engineering so we could get the most bang for our buck. The decorating of the spaces was left mostly to me and it was interesting trying to figure out my own taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We, like all imperfect clients, wanted this Brooklyn brownstone renovated on a contractor&#8217;s-grade budget. Obviously, we were being silly and went way over budget (and right at what our contractor told us it would cost; we were just deeply in denial about the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of construction</a> in NYC). The mechanicals in a home are so expensive that basically most of the money was gone before we made a single design choice. And for me, I care deeply about the fixtures, finishes, and materials and I wasn’t about to cheap out on the things we had to see and use every day. So just be honest with yourself about what you want and what you’re willing to pay or give up for it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I was most excited about the kitchen<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>if that hasn’t already been made clear. I love throwing huge parties and dinners, and I like to spend my alone time cooking. It’s also a natural gathering spot, so it was exciting to think about getting the most out of the space. Turns out the space configuration of a Brooklyn brownstone made it hard to do that, but it still served us well—I am super happy with a long <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> (11 feet long!), a BlueStar stove, and the different stations for cooking, eating, making coffee, or baking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen is my happy spot and I’ve spent years thinking about what makes a good kitchen. Is this ideal space planning? Nope. Is this my idea of a good time? For sure. The challenge was how to devise an open-plan area that was going to take up so much of the parlor floor without making it feel like a separate room. My solution was to forgo upper <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> so there&#8217;s a clear line of vision from the front of the room all the way to the dining room. This created a storage challenge for me, of course, which we solved with a kitchen pantry. I wanted the pantry to be open so that I could see and access all my ingredients easily, but I also didn’t want a lot of visual clutter. I <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painted</a> the cabinets and shelves a deep gray (same color as the island cabinets), which makes the whole space disappear once I turn out the light. I found a piece of scrap marble at the stone yard which I used for the kitchen backsplash and the countertops along the back wall closest to the pantry. Marble is expensive and hard to maintain, so my thought was to use it in low-use areas to give the look and feel of the material throughout the kitchen without spending that much. For the island and other countertops, I used poured concrete, which is a material I love. Surprisingly, it’s also pretty delicate, but it’s subtle and earthy and I like how it ages. The kitchen is, again, more traditional than I would have preferred, but I think the concrete and the open shelving give it a more modern touch. Also, I fought to get a second sink in the kitchen and am so happy I won that battle. It’s handy to set up a water station so people can grab water or rinse out cups without interrupting my cooking space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I can’t say enough about how much I love these herringbone walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>. We splurged on these floors and went with the less costly white oak for the upstairs floors because…well, just look at them. My original vision was to have the tile floor in the kitchen, but it made more sense to continue the wood on the whole parlor floor and save the tile for the back extension. We mocked up the island with plywood and adjusted it until I was happy with the dimensions—how it felt to go from sink to stove, or how easy it was to take food out of the fridge and place it on the counter. That kind of stuff is important to me, and this was the first time I really got to design my own kitchen for myself. Everything is a bit taller and it suits me just great.</p>
<p>A note on accessibility: I’ve had friends and families with different mobility and impairment issues—whether wheelchair-bound, deaf, or arthritic—and time spent with them has made me very conscious of what it means to design well for many. A landmarked Brooklyn brownstone is a nightmare for anyone with a wheelchair, a walker, or a stroller, and I also saw firsthand some of the challenges that my design choices presented.</p>
<p>The first set of cabinet pulls in the kitchen were a lovely set of straight, minimalist tab pulls. I loved that they gave the kitchen a more modern look. Cue my mother and mother-in-law coming over all the time and struggling with the pulls. They couldn’t grasp the straight pull with their arthritic fingers. I switched them out right away for pulls with a fully curved handle. Now they can just stick their finger under the pull, and a small motion opens the drawers. People keep talking about their &#8220;forever homes,&#8221; but really think about how you, your guests, and your children will have to adapt to the spaces as everyone starts to get older.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other end of our Brooklyn brownstone, and connected to the kitchen, is the dining room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar</a>. We love this room. We really felt like this room, a back extension added in the 1910s, was the reason we bought this place. Then we sadly rebuilt the entire room, but somehow, it’s still our favorite space in the house. So that was a great surprise—buying a house because of one room and then recreating it and still having that be the best spot in the house. It’s our dining room and bar, but we also have space under the dining bench to store all of Nacho’s gear so that he can draw and play at the table while I am cooking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From being in other friends’ homes, I knew that extensions were always freezing cold and hard to heat. All I wanted was Moroccan tile for this room (in fact, for the whole house, but we just didn’t have the budget for that). Everyone fought me on adding radiant heating to the subfloor, but it’s by far the warmest room during the winter. Larry and I often come home and lie down on the floor and accidentally fall asleep! During the summer, this is the room we hang out in while kids run in and out of the house to the backyard. The best surprise? That giant Tiffany stained-glass window, which was hidden by a crappy 1970’s bookcase on the inside and vinyl siding on the outside. As soon as we bought the house, we ripped down the bookcase hoping we’d find a window, and lo and behold, we did. It was in near perfect condition. We completely sealed it with clear glass on the outside to avoid damage and heat loss, as we did with all the other stained glass details around the parlor floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a large fireplace in this room, but I couldn’t figure out how to fit the mantel and Larry’s bar, and after much cajoling, I finally convinced Larry to agree to rip out the fireplace. The mantel has a new home in the living room, where the original had been removed previously. I will say, to the horror of preservationists everywhere, that I wish we didn’t have our mantels—they don’t work, they take up too much space, and they create artificial focal points in every room. Maybe if they were marble, I’d appreciate them more. It’s form without function, which I have no love for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The powder room was a tough one to figure out. I hate the idea of guests having to go upstairs to use the bathroom, and with a small child, it&#8217;s great to have a bathroom on every floor. I think powder rooms should be wacky. This one is tiny, so doing a fun wallpaper or paint color was relatively cheap. I love the electric Cole &amp; Sons Palms wallpaper—it adds a touch of fun to an otherwise formal dining room. I also love the pop of color from the door to the powder room. We hated having the stained glass window facing a dull orange wall because it cast a weird orangey glow into the room. Rather than fight it, though, we decided to paint the door an amped-up version of that wall to tie the colors together in a fun way.</p>

<p>Nine years seems like a long time, but some things are worth the wait. That’s the case for Barbra, a television producer, and Sean, who purchased their 1,100-square-foot Kensington, Brooklyn, prewar co-op and only recently renovated. They were used to kitchen cabinets too shallow for dinner plates, broken track lighting, and crumbling baseboards. Despite it all, the couple, along with their sons Jack, 11, and Clint, 8, are glad they lived in the space and really understood what they wanted and needed before remodeling. It made it easier when they posted <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6153" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Kensington co-op renovation project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose their contractor</a>, who they say was open to their ideas, gave them great tips on where (and where not) to splurge, and helped them stay within budget.</p>
<p>The apartment had a lot of light and great bones, but it was dated and needed a complete overhaul. A slapdash remodel in the 1980s included tile haphazardly layered over older tile in the bathroom and a weird bookshelf installation that covered up a pass-through to the living room—which meant they had to walk around the entire room to get to their dining table. The kitchen area had wrong-height countertops and an unnecessary wall that separated the space.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The previous owners had added a third </span>bedroom,<span style="color: #000000;"> but it was too small to fit anything other than a bed. The goal was to even out those bedrooms so their boys could have their own rooms, without one of them being seriously shortchanged on space. Barbra and Sean&#8217;s overall vision was for everything to be simple, functional, clean, </span>updated<span style="color: #000000;">, and bright. The co-op had a lot of natural light and they really wanted the renovation to show that off.</span></p>

<p>The couple knew their project was going to be a really big job. They’d renovated a much smaller apartment once before, but it was a simple, cosmetic remodel for resale—nothing like this project. Barbra recalls learning early that she had to do all her research on fixtures, materials, appliances, style, and colors before starting the renovation work to save time and money. &#8220;I never knew how many different types of doorknobs there were—or even realized I had strong preferences in doorknobs,&#8221; she said, &#8220;until I actually had to choose one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The renovation started with bringing the electric up to code. There were unusable outlets and fixtures, and old electric and phone cable lines littered the apartment. Having those ripped out and new lines installed behind the walls &#8220;made my day,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As for the walls themselves, despite having been built in 1935, there really weren’t any remarkable moldings. To keep the space modern but classic, baseboards and doors were kept clean and similar to the originals. To brighten everything up, they installed all new lighting. &#8220;Seeing the non-working track lighting get pulled out of the living room was incredibly satisfying,&#8221; Barbra said. The floors were refinished, which let the original herringbone pattern stand out. &#8220;Refinishing made a bigger difference than I would’ve thought,&#8221; Barbra said.</p>

<p>They had a mural on the foyer wall that a friend had painted when they moved in. They were sad to see it go but knew a statement wall would work there.  &#8220;I love wallpaper but wanted to use it sparingly, so this seemed like the perfect spot for it,&#8221; Barbra said.</p>

<p>Opening up the kitchen and adding a new pass-through closer to the dining area made a huge difference. Their light-filled apartment was even brighter and sunnier now. In the kitchen, they brought in more storage by adding cabinets that went to the ceiling. They loved patterns and bold colors, but aside from the kitchen floor tile, the couple opted to save the patterns for easily changeable items like the wallpaper, rugs, pillows, and paint. As for choosing the navy shade on their cabinets, they felt the layout was classic enough that they could easily swap the door panels out for a new look, if they want it, in the future.</p>

<p>Their desk area had always existed in the kitchen, so when planning the new layout, it seemed natural to carve out an area specifically for this use. They found a desk that fit the opening perfectly and used wallpaper left over from the foyer to give it a more finished look.</p>

<p>Storage was important in other rooms, as well. In the master bedroom, their Sweeten contractor suggested combining the two existing small closets into one large one with a custom closet system. A closet was added to the third bedroom, which now had space after moving the wall, as well as a custom system to one of the entry closets. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot more functional space now,&#8221; Barbra said. &#8220;I even have some half-way empty dresser drawers. I wish I had done all the closets. Someday!&#8221;</p>

<p>The other spaces that needed serious attention, of course, were the two bathrooms. They were falling apart and together made up one functioning bath: the master bath had a working shower, but the sink was broken and the second bathroom’s shower didn’t work but the sink did. The working shower had mold and a sinking shower pan. In the bathrooms, they focused on clean lines and classic tile in black/white/gray colors.</p>
<p>While researching materials, &#8220;<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/sweetenhome/pins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest boards</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sweeten_home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> were my friends. I started to find patterns with things that I liked and tagged—from tile patterns and blue color tones to exposed bulb fixtures and wood stain colors—which helped me come up with a style (if you can call it that) for the overall space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It helped to have a clearer idea of the look I wanted to achieve with inspiration photos to refer to and show my contractor.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were also open to ideas from their contractor. They liked that their Sweeten contractor wasn’t a “yes-man” and offered more efficient alternatives to some ideas they presented. He gave them tips on what to splurge on (the custom closets and shower doors, tile) and what not to (custom cabinets) to help them stay within budget.</p>
<p>When they encountered a few bumps in the road, such as waste lines and interior pipes that needed replacement, a delayed vanity cabinet, and a broken dishwasher handle &#8220;he communicated with us right away and offered immediate solutions,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Not only was their work stellar, but they were all incredibly nice guys who gave valuable feedback and advice throughout the process. Every element of our home was done with care and with attention to detail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everything now is clean, airy, and bright; it feels homey, Barbra reports. &#8220;I never wanted to invest in furniture and art because everything felt so temporary,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Now that the space is renovated, I know we’ll live here for many years and can now take the time to invest in pieces that are right for it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A fun crop of ways to make cooking more colorful</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If patterns in the kitchen feel outdated to you, think again. We’ve got proof that they’re making a steady (and stylish!) comeback. From personality-filled wallpaper prints to classic tile patterns, Sweeten homeowners are playing with subtle—and some not-so-subtle—forms of contrast in the kitchen. Read on for five unique takes on pattern play.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21189 mb-0 size-chrono" title="wallpaper in the kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen design" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Captivated by a Hygge &amp; West design featuring orange birds on a blue background, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mollie</a> used the wallpaper to set the tone for her kitchen’s color scheme. She also chose a playful black-and-white tile to continue the thread of whimsy from the walls to the floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24620 mb-0 size-chrono" title="patterned floor tile" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen design" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/newlywed-writers-turn-dark-kitchen-bestseller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda</a> designed her kitchen from the ground up after selecting a Mediterranean-inspired tile for the floor. The rest of the design was chosen to complement the one-of-a-kind flooring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20497 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1501" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/rimas-ikea-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rima</a> originally chose white subway tile for her kitchen backsplash, but her friends talked her out of it. A mix of white and gray hex tile create a modern mosaic, providing a hint of contrast without going overboard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31090 mb-0 size-chrono" title="wallpaper in the kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="kitchen design" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After going with blue-gray cabinets in the kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-lightens-up-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ainsley</a> extended the color scheme into the dining room with an abstract blue and white wallpaper that pairs well with the warmth of the wood furniture and flooring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21360 mb-0 size-chrono" title="patterned floor tile" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="kitchen design" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to preserve the classic design of her prewar kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emily</a> chose a simple black and white color scheme. For the floor, Spanish tile injects some old-world charm and ties the look together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-28923 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />While gray cabinets and gold hardware set a sophisticated tone in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/holly-kitchen-bath-renovation-greenwich-village/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holly and Christian’s kitchen</a>, a chevron marble backsplash keeps the space feeling fresh and energized.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nancy-Wallpaper.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31088 mb-0 size-chrono" title="black-white-wall-gray-backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nancy-Wallpaper.gif" alt="black and white walled kitchen with gray backsplash and white kitchen cabinets after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With limited square footage, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/movie-set-comes-life-studio-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nancy</a> knew that bold colors would make her kitchen feel cramped. Instead, a fun wallpaper with a dizzying array of black dots across a white backdrop makes a lively addition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28322" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavi’s kitchen</a>, the new backsplash provides plenty of drama. White subway tiles were replaced with a kaleidoscope of black, gray, and white triangular tiles for a look that’s modern and luxe.</p>
<p>—</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A renovation and decor overhaul were naturally in the plan when stylish design magazine Domino sought out a larger office in Midtown Manhattan for their 40-person team. They called on Sweeten for a general contractor who could carve out distinct and creative areas from a light-filled but blank open space, including a reception area, a photo studio, and a kitchen camera-ready for cooking demos. A complete build-out that was outfitted with pops of wallpaper, velvet seating, and decor galore, the result was a comfortable workspace for editors and guests alike.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you find Sweeten and what made you want to try the service?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Beth Brenner, <em>Domino</em>:</strong> A few colleagues were sitting around one afternoon contemplating partners for our new office reno. We were moving into an old sewing factory so we knew that we had walls to build. Our wish list also included a photo studio and studio kitchen where we could create food and entertaining content on an ongoing basis. But what we didn’t know was how to find a contractor to work with nor how to start the project! Our marketing manager asked if I had ever heard of Sweeten and proclaimed, “They are so on-brand for us.” Five minutes later, I sent a blind email to team@sweeten.com and, before the day’s end, Sweeten’s director of communications, Kerry O’Brien, responded. Seems the enthusiasm to work together was completely mutual!</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Why did Domino move offices?</p>
<p><em><strong>Domino</strong></em><strong>:</strong> We needed more space for our growing company—the best reason there is!</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How does your new space reflect your brand?</p>
<p><em><strong>Domino</strong></em><strong>:</strong> We set out to design a creative oasis that was full of light and energy—a chic space that felt at once casual and elevated, much like the <em>Domino</em> brand. While the furniture itself has a modern feel, the soft pink walls and mix of accessories and art really warm up the rooms. And, for an element of surprise and delight, we installed a Missoni-wallpapered “good vibes” phone room where team members can find a few minutes of peace.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What are the favorite aspects of the new space?</p>
<p><em><strong>Domino</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Because there is only one conference room, it was important that the space be flexible and that distinct areas be carved out for smaller meetings, private phone calls, and visiting guests. Various “nooks” were created where people now gather, the most notable of which are the Anthropologie-infused reception area and, of course, our beautiful new kitchen, which was designed and built by our Sweeten contractor. As in every home, it’s the primary gathering spot!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30087 size-chrono" title="flexible workspace" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace03-723x1085.jpg" alt="office space design" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Flexible workspace/reading area<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30093 mt-24 size-chrono" title="bar area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace01-723x1085.jpg" alt="office space design" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Acrylic consoles as bar area</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What kind of work desks does everyone have?</p>
<p><strong><em>Domino</em>:</strong> The desks themselves are all the same—modern white tables, mint green file cabinets, and cushion-y off-white chairs from our good friends at CB2—but it’s been fun to watch everyone on the team personalize their own space. There were also many requests for standing desks, so we added two adjustable desks from BDI and placed them in a central area so everyone could rotate through.</p>

</a>Guest post by Nancy in her Upper East Side studio apartment</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Nancy&#8217;s first New York City apartment was a long time in the making—35 years to be exact. She searched for a dream home in Manhattan where she could apply the movie set design playing in her mind, but none of the spaces felt right. So Nancy, who works in human resources, took matters into her own hands and purchased a 550-square-foot studio apartment on the Upper East Side that hadn&#8217;t been touched since the &#8217;60s. Everything required an overhaul! To bring her vision to life, she made smart sacrifices in her narrow 6-foot-wide kitchen, turned a closet into a walk-in dressing room, and used wallpaper to carve out separate areas. You&#8217;ll want to read Nancy&#8217;s renovation journey.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I&#8217;ve lived in the city my whole life and have spent the last 35 years mentally cataloging my favorite buildings, blocks, and parts of the city. When I decided to buy my first place a few years ago, I was living in Chelsea—and loved it—but knew I need to shift my search further uptown to get more for my budget. I had always gravitated towards the Upper East Side and gone to open houses on and off over the years. If there&#8217;s an elevator, doorman building without in-window air conditioning units (my only real deal-breaker) in the East 70s, I&#8217;ve probably been there at some point. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The first apartment I saw on my search was in the same line I’m currently living in but on a lower floor. The apartment had been redone in a style that was fine but not my own, and the alcove was turned into a narrow bedroom cut off from heat and air conditioning. </span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Fast forward a few months and I&#8217;d been turned off by so many similar “I could live with it, I guess” renovations that I was determined to buy a place that would require a lot of work, knowing I might need to sacrifice space for the ability to make my place my own. I had loved the location, building, and low maintenance costs of that first place I&#8217;d seen months ago and found a studio apartment on StreetEasy that hadn&#8217;t been touched since the &#8217;60s, except for some new appliances–score! An offer was made, and I set out to renovate before moving in. I was excited that EVERYTHING required a refresh. My apartment is a decent-sized alcove studio—about 550 square feet—in a postwar Upper East Side high-rise. Since moving in, I&#8217;ve welcomed a fluffy new roommate named Hudson, who enjoys spending his days on the couch. We&#8217;re still working on getting him to embrace his dog bed.</span></p>

I met with a few matches and had a ton of questions. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*What would this cost (or rather, can I do all this with what I want to spend)? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*How long would it take? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*How easy is it to get all my plans approved by my co-op board and the city? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I&#8217;d been dreaming of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1847" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this project</a> since I first discovered HGTV and had a pretty clear vision of what I had in mind: </span><span class="s1">a light and airy space&#8230;a dreamy beach house vibe that a character in a Nancy Meyers movie was tragically forced to squeeze into a tiny New York studio apartment (the “It’s Complicated” kitchen will have to wait). </span><span class="s1"> That said, I knew I needed a lot of help executing that vision and managing all of the pieces of a renovation that don&#8217;t find their way onto a Pinterest board. My Sweeten contractor was great at figuring out the best way to rewire the space, upgrade the electric panel, add in a ceiling light in the living space, inject new life to the parquet floors, and bring the plumbing up to standard.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">My contractor and I spent a ton of time playing with the footprint. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Should we close off the alcove?  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Turn the small linen closet into a new entrance for a dressing room/bathroom?  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Open up the kitchen and wrap the cabinets into the living space? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Expand both the closets into a small extra room and move the living space to the windows?  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Ultimately, we decided to keep the footprint as-is, but widen the kitchen entrance that led into the living space, reconfigure the walk-in closet to be more user-friendly with french doors, and turn the cramped sleeping area closets into an open dressing room. I was always excited about the storage in the apartment, but now it&#8217;s much more efficient. Everything is put away in its own place and the storage blends into the look of the space.  </span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The other big question was the kitchen layout. I dragged my mom—fresh off two of her own major kitchen renovations—to IKEA on multiple occasions to work out a footprint that would achieve two things in the small space: provide as much drawer storage as possible and add a dishwasher. After one particularly insane mock-up where I had almost convinced myself I could turn the 6-foot-wide space into a galley kitchen with a dishwasher drawer stacked over an oven (must have been Swedish meatball-induced temporary insanity), we realized <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom cabinets</a> were the way to go. Surprisingly, Home Depot came through with their Innermost collection where each piece could be semi-customized to bring the cabinets to the ceiling and turn a corner into usable space. I love that I was able to fit a shallow utensil drawer below the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">induction cooktop</a>. Choosing to forego the standard oven range was probably my most &#8216;controversial&#8217; decision—I really wanted that dishwasher—but I&#8217;ve come to love the induction top that fits into the countertop. The combo microwave/convection oven is perfect for my needs—it cooks just as well as most of the tiny apartment ovens and frees up a ton of space.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The rest of the decisions were mostly a balance between putting my stamp on the place and keeping resale in mind. I decided to go more traditional with the permanent kitchen and bath fixtures, but have more fun with the wallpaper, fabrics, lighting, and other decorative items. Using the Tanzania wallpaper print in the entryway helped define the space and kept with the black-and-white color palette. When I decided to keep the studio apartment as an open plan, I still wanted to keep the bedroom area defined as its own and the wallpaper from Flat Vernacular—which I’m in love with—does that well. It also keeps with the light feeling of the space. My contractor suggested molding with clean profiles—it&#8217;s actually just lumber—that works perfectly with the simple baseboards. I love the detail on the new <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doors</a> that have a simple style but give a bit of interest around the casing, which also helps relieve any warping with time. The floors were sanded down and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refinished</a> in a matte gray tone.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The cramped, shallow bathtub was replaced with a large shower, making the space feel more open and so much more functional—perfect for containing Hudson’s bathtime messes. The deep <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage cabinet</a> above the toilet was one of the few things I&#8217;d probably do differently as it was a gaffe on my part. I ordered the cabinet without paying attention to how far out it would protrude—it&#8217;s 10-inches deep—and was installed with tile around it before I realized. It&#8217;s not the end of the world, but using a shallow medicine cabinet would have been a better choice.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">As with any reno, there were some hiccups along the way with permits taking a long time to come through and building regulations stopping work for any and all holidays. The 60-year-old pipes burst downstairs onto some very understanding neighbors, and then from above onto my freshly renovated space about a week after everything was done! </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Sweeten was a great partner along the way. Once I posted my project, they helped me figure out what I could do with my budget and asked the right questions so I could evaluate the bids I received. </span><span class="s1">They were a great sounding board when faced with questions during the process, such as delays and increased costs. I definitely recommend any renovator to use the Sweeten team to understand all the moving pieces throughout the process. Having lived in my space for some time now, I love it, and there isn&#8217;t much I would do differently. I am getting the bug to renovate and decorate a new space. So who knows, maybe I&#8217;ll be calling Sweeten again soon with a new space to refresh!</span></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34015 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Portrait-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: Blane&#8217;s apartment overhaul is truly unforgettable. The post, originally published in 2016, showcases a mix of high-end materials and appliances paired with budget-friendly cabinets. An accountant by trade, Blane knows when to splurge and when to save, blending stock items with custom pieces throughout his home. Read on for a smart reno and play a fun game of &#8220;spot the pup!&#8221; in the photos below.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After “countless hours of watching HGTV,” Blane started to have big thoughts about ways he might make the kitchen and bathroom in his Ditmas Park/North Midwood condo better. While neither space was in particularly bad shape, he knew when he moved in that he would be plagued by a lack of light in the kitchen, and the bathroom felt mismatched to modern updates elsewhere in the apartment. With visions of a TV-worthy renovation, he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project on Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted contractors, and was introduced to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blane works in accounting at a law firm and is no stranger to budgets, so he was fastidious with his planning, choosing materials and fleshing out a game plan before even meeting with a contractor. With an initial budget of $35K, he planned to brighten the kitchen with cabinets in a lighter hue, substantially increase the limited counter space with an island, add a sliding door to the bedroom to keep the entry transition as efficient as possible, and cultivate a luxurious vibe in the master bath with an oversized walk-in shower and a neutral color scheme in place of its existing minty and slightly medical vibe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15588 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15590 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After extensive research and some early attempts at drawing out his own cabinet footprint, he got started with his contractor. First, the team decided to tackle the bathroom. Here, Blane got his inspiration from an unlikely place. “My first purchase was actually the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilet</a>, and things kind of evolved around there,” Blane said. “I’ve never had any sort of fancy toilet like that before. The new toilet has a remote, which I had never heard of. The Japanese are at the forefront of luxury so we’ll trust them.” The Toto toilet was just the beginning of the luxe vibe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blane chose a combination of slate and hexagon mosaic tiles for the wall, with a neutral mix of stone and wood for the heated (yes, heated!) floors. Then he pulled out all the stops with a walk-in, double-wide shower with a custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding glass door</a> and rain showerhead, plus a double sink vanity, in a bit of long-range planning to make the apartment cohabitation-friendly. The contractor&#8217;s team capped the detailed work with a slanted, but sturdy, bench design in the shower and herringbone tile design on the bathroom floor, all in a soothing gray palette.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34002 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x464.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="464" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34003 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-723x471.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="471" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34004 mb-0 size-chrono" title="shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-723x1069.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="1069" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, Blane chose white upper cabinets with gray base units, giving the space a brightened, more modern effect. After heavy research focused on IKEA, the contractor actually suggested Blane swap his blueprint for a similar cabinet option from Home Depot, which gave him the same lacquered and bright uppers, with a striated gray laminate bottom set. The team removed a wall and moved the oven to the other side of the cabinet line, opening up the kitchen and improving the flow for prep and serving. To give Blane even more space for culinary exploits (and entertaining), the team brought in an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> with a durable, waterfall quartz countertop with room for bar seating. Bonus: The island features its own electrical outlets, thanks to the contractor who snuck in a power source under a few floorboards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34008 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-723x464.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="464" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Blane-Cabinets.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34017 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Blane-Cabinets.gif" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34019 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-1-723x489.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="489" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34012 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the dining room, Blane purchased a stunning ghost wood table, handmade by Jim at <a href="https://www.breukelentafel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breukelen Tafel</a> in Carroll Gardens. To highlight the space, he and the team created a wallpapered accent wall to bring together the table, the gray walls, and the white and gray in the kitchen. “I think the wall, even though it was a simple thing, is now one of the best features of the apartment,” Blane said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34014 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-13-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blane admits that the process was mostly painless—despite living in the condo with a dog throughout the renovation. Though he went over his budget by 40 percent, he admits it was because of his decisions to choose more premium materials rather than any runaway labor costs. Even with the bathroom and kitchen in process at the same time, Blane was impressed that living in the rubble could be possible thanks to the team’s efforts to seal up the work zones and keep dust to a minimum. Looking at the finished product, Blane is thrilled. “I’m really happy it worked out,” Blane said. “Especially since I didn’t have a designer and I was relying on my accountant abilities to make good decisions.” Even though the contractor didn&#8217;t come from a design and build firm, his decades of experience let Blane lean on him for opinions and advice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But Blane’s best advice for anyone going into the process is to do as much research as possible and be prepared to adjust as challenges come up. Inconvenient issues can sometimes be opportunities: when a light problem with Blane&#8217;s closet or gaps between wall and ceiling tiles were discovered, the contractor came up with elegant solutions that often improved on the original plan. “They take great pride in their work, and even came back to do a touch-up here and there as things settled in the months after the project ended, at no additional cost,” Blane said. “If the final results don&#8217;t speak already for themselves, I highly recommend them.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Blane-Sliding-Door.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34018 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dark-brown-floor-brown-door" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Blane-Sliding-Door.gif" alt="dark brown floor and brown door and a staircase" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now Blane has the space to sprawl in his upgraded condo with one of Brooklyn’s most adorable dogs, his new pup, Harvey. However, he sheepishly admits he’s not always using that kitchen for intense, five-star-worthy fare. “I’m cooking now more than I was, but you get in that sandwich kick and it’s hard to change from that.”</p>
