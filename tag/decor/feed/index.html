			<h2 class="p1">From efficient ADUs to spa-like bathrooms, home interior design in Los Angeles points to simplicity, utility, and going traditional</h2>
<p class="p2"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46811 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg" alt="bedroom remodel for actress Jaime Ray Newman los angeles" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">Diversity is king when it comes to home interior design in Los Angeles. The city has a sense of history, with styles spanning Spanish Colonial to Mission Revival, Beaux-Arts to Art Deco, Hollywood Regency to streamline 1930s modern. The desire to preserve those design styles is strong, as is the need to make homes liveable for today. H<span>ome renovation design trends in Los Angeles</span> and what rooms and features are important have shifted nationwide. Fortunately, for LA contractors and designers, remodeling has not missed a beat.</p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Top photo</em>) Sweeten renovators and actor Jaime Ray Newman and Guy Nattiv&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles home renovation</a></span></p>
<h3>Changes and challenges: Home interior design in Los Angeles</h3>
<p class="p2">“We didn’t really see much of a change,” said Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5968#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA general contractor Trevor</a>. “It&#8217;s just a redirect.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The challenge is more about materials shortages, delays, and rising costs</span><span class="s2">.</span> “The cost of lumber is affecting building,” said Trevor. Sheet plywood, for example, has jumped from $18 to around $50, he said. “People are asking for alternatives to lumber, like tin framing used in commercial.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">A renewed focus on outdoor living</h3>
<p class="p2">“A lot more people are fixing their exterior,” said Trevor. “People want to spend money on outdoor hardscapes, swimming pools. In LA, that’s where you spend 60 percent of your time.”</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.cozystylishchic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA-based designer Jeanne Chung</a> agreed. “It’s all about indoor-outdoor living,” she said. NanaWalls, which fold in and extend the indoor space out to patios, are very popular. “They double the square footage of eating and entertaining areas,” said Jeanne.</p>
<p class="p2">The bonus of adding windows, especially large ones to foster the indoor/outdoor connection is gaining more natural light.</p>
<p class="p2">Homeowners are also investing in <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor rooms</a>. Pools, water features, outdoor kitchens, firepits, and extensive seating and dining areas are high on wish lists. Materials are more organic, “definitely going back to nature.” Trevor is using a lot of textured cement, stamped, and honed finishes. “A salt finish really is big. With mid-century design, there’s a lot of tile work. We do ipe wood outdoors and a type of red hardwood that is slightly less hard than ipe, but about half the price.”</p>
<h3 class="p5">ADUs and additions for more square footage</h3>
<p class="p2">One rising trend for home interior design in Los Angeles is remodeling ADUs (accessory dwelling units). “It’s generating the <span style="color: #333333;">biggest buzz,” said <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor Trevor. </span>These detached structures, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often garages</a>, are repurposed as guest houses, rentals, or home offices.</p>
<p class="p2">Many of her clients are adding to the existing footprint. “They’re knocking out walls to create a little extra space, as in bathrooms, for example.”</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg" alt="Modern living room with glass walls and modern gray fireplace" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirsty and David&#8217;s</a> Mid-City/Miracle Mile home in LA</span></p>
<p class="p2">“You can build a second story,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “It’s contingent on the footprint of the existing structure. A lot are pushed outside of the setback, so they go high vertically. People are going for the max. It’s getting a lot of value on the price for square foot.” If you&#8217;re planning on expanding or remodeling a kitchen or bathroom (more on them below), look for a vetted general contractor that is licensed. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor in LA</a> with experience will guide you through the process.</p>
<h3>Keeping kitchens fresh and updated</h3>
<p class="p6">“It’s where you get the most <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bang for the buck</a>,” said Trevor. The remodel here may happen more frequently than in other parts of the country. Apparently, design fatigue sets in earlier. He has <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to kitchens</a> remodeled just two years before for a refresh. “It’s like changing wardrobes.”</p>
<p class="p2">LA kitchens tend to be large, mostly open plan, and gourmet with top-of-the-line professional appliances. But there’s not as much carving, ornate moldings, over-the-top use of stones. Instead, there’s more of a creative mix of materials. At the same time, the goal is more making it your own with custom looks—tile backsplashes, bold color ranges, and stove hoods.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="geometric-pattern-black-white-backsplash-tiles" class="alignnone wp-image-50846 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass.jpg" alt="peninsula island in kitchen with white marble countertop and undermount sink with gold faucet and fixtures and pendant lights and black kitchen cabinets and geometric pattern black white backsplash tiles and vent over cooking range after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h4>Top kitchen materials to watch</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Cabinets. Simple clean-lined styles are flat-panel and frameless. Hardware is modern, sculptural, or jewelry-like. Otherwise, there are hidden touch latches. Wood is finding competition in painted finishes, mostly in soothing livable shades.</li>
<li class="p2">Island culture. Some islands are getting bigger, some are multi-level for different functions. Waterfall sides on islands are popular.</li>
<li class="p2">Appliances. Pro-style ranges favor stylish brands like cooktops and ovens from Wolf, Monogram by GE, LaCornue, and Lacanche. The desire to cook healthy promotes features like special burners for woks, steam cooking. Some ranges even have an integrated sous vide. The slow cooking in a vacuum-sealed bag retains more nutrients, uses less oil, fat, and salt.</li>
<li class="p2">Porcelain and quartz are gaining in popularity because of the similar looks to stone without the maintenance. Large slabs and large format tiles offer a seamless installation with no grout lines to break up the design. Matte finishes have overtaken shiny ones.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">“Here in LA, my clients don’t want polished,” said Jeanne. “I am using concrete-looking porcelain slabs and cement tiles.” Jeanne seals her concrete to guard against staining because it’s pretty porous.</p>
<h4>Finishes lead the way</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Color is taking a turn. Moody, dark colors—black, deep blues, and bottle greens—are ramping up, said Sweeten contractor Trevor. They pair well with burnished or brushed gold. “I do a lot of antiqued blue—like a muted denim—with brass pulls,” he said.</li>
<li class="p2">Lighter woods seem to suit the lighter mood of interiors. That goes for cabinets as well as flooring. Wide plank wood floors are on trend—with an average of 7&#8243;—and in French oak whitewashed finishes, cappuccino, some with a hint of gray.</li>
<li class="p2">Gold touch. LA homeowners are opting more for burnished and brushed gold finishes in cabinet hardware, faucets, and lighting. Some appliance manufacturers now include brass pulls as options. But mixing gold, especially with black matte, is very chic. Mixing metals adds interest to the design, especially in kitchens, where there is a lot of cabinetry.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">The spa bath is redefined</h3>
<p class="p2">In Los Angeles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgrading the whole bathroom</a> means incorporating a level of comfort. Freestanding tubs provide a visual <i>tour de force</i>. Most often they are made of stone, porcelain, quartz, or resin, so the shape lends a sculptural note. Large curbless walk-in showers are distinguished with surface materials. Linear drains are trending because they are more aesthetically pleasing. Rain showers are favored, but you won’t find multiple showerheads due to water restrictions. Floors often are radiant heated.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="gray-vanity-marble-countertop-hanging-mirror" class="alignnone wp-image-50847 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918.jpg" alt="large gray single vanity with white marble countertop and brushed nickel hardware and gold faucet and fixtures and hanging circular mirror infront of window after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Variations of brass finishes in this LA renovation by designer Jeanne Chung. Photos by Peter Christiansen Valli. </span></p>
<p class="p2">The divide—choosing between tub and shower—is more about personal preferences. Many see the sculptural artistry of the tub as adding to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return on investment</a>. Radiant heat is also a value-added. An alternative to slab stone walls is large-format porcelain tile. These tiles, with a range of looks that mimic various stones, come in similar slab formats.</p>
<p class="p2">More than ever, the bath is <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered an oasis</a>. The overall style may be elegant, but again, the overall look is simplified, with cleaner, more modern lines.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Ensuite bedrooms are preferred to mega-size closets</h3>
<p class="p2">Jeanne said her clients would rather have larger bedrooms with sitting areas than supersized closets. Still, walk-in closets are on remodeling wish lists.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Storage is key</h3>
<p class="p2">Unseen compartments in drawers or cubbies in cabinetry and built-in benches corral stuff to keep spaces visually clean.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49429 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg" alt="Modern kitchen with exposed beams and stacked washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy and Kevin&#8217;s</a> Westchester home in LA</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Mudrooms are still going strong</h3>
<p class="p2">Although some trend forecasters suggest the demise of these transitional spaces for hanging coats and dropping gear, Jeanne said not so in LA. “Especially with the pandemic,” she said, “There’s a desire for bigger mudrooms. It’s like a decontamination area—coming into the home, taking off all your grimy stuff.” Typical layouts include hanging storage behind doors, cubbies, and benches for putting on shoes or boots. Some incorporate pet stations.</p>
<h3 class="p2">There’s an uptick in requests for libraries</h3>
<p class="p2">“It’s a very popular room right now,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “It’s only going to get more popular. I’ve had three customers recently tell me they want libraries—real traditional, with everything built in.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">Home offices are making a comeback</h3>
<p class="p2">The Zoom fatigue is real, but so is the realization that the backdrop for those visual calls needs to step up. Jeanne recently had a request from a wife to make her husband’s office more fashionable—because of his frequent video calls.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Ongoing remodeling trends consistent in LA</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li class="p2">Going green and sustainability is much more in demand with a more conscious effort to utilize eco-friendly materials as well as those that save energy.</li>
<li class="p2">Smart home. Automation adjusts to temperature, lighting, and security. Smart devices even monitor cooking.</li>
<li class="p2">A few things to consider when remodeling in LA: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seismic codes</a> that require tall stem walls, slab on grade with thick foundations in order to guard against earthquake damage. Also, water restriction dictates the kinds of showers allowed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" class="elementor-button-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Find a contractor</span></a></p>
<h3 class="p2">Classic and traditional design emerges</h3>
<p>For home interior design in Los Angeles, Trevor also said that there appears to be a return to more traditional design.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p2">“Mid-century modern has always been huge like ranch home designs,” he said. &#8220;But traditional design is coming back—I would call it a mix between mid-century, Dutch, and American traditional. Recently I’ve been seeing yellow and some of the 70s colors coming back.”</li>
<li class="p2">Statement decorating is hot. It’s part of the remodel plan. It could be a feature wall, a painted mural, or wallcovering. It could be a pop of color in a professional range or a graphic patterned tile on a backsplash. Outdoors, it might be a pergola, water, or fire feature.</li>
<li class="p2">There’s an appreciation for artisanal looks. Handmade tiles, handcrafted hardware lend personality to interiors. Some renovation inspiration comes from restaurant and hotel design.</li>
<li class="p2">“Simplicity—we’re definitely going in that direction,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “Not so much baroque-style with lots of moldings. People are going functional. They want hip and stylish.” There’s a minimalist sensibility, but not in the spare extreme.</li>
<li class="p2">California style—with a modern or rustic refined look—still is strong, with lighter bleached look woods and ceiling beams.</li>
</ul>

While most home renovations focus on the kitchen and bath, the bedroom is arguably just as important. Although bedrooms are key spaces for retreating from the stress of everyday life, they&#8217;re often deprioritized during renovations. Updating a master bedroom—even with simple refreshes—can have an outsize impact on how we enjoy our homes.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re seeking master bedroom ideas to guide your design dreams, look no further! These Sweeten renovators turned the spotlight on their own master bedrooms, using unique design approaches to refresh their favorite space in the house.</p>

<p>Dreaming of a special, cozy place to call your own? If you have the room and your space is configured correctly, consider adding a reading nook. They are great places to allow you to relax and unwind. Plus, they look beautiful as well. For <em>Little Fires Everywhere</em> actress <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaime Ray Newman,</a> a geometric-patterned bench provided not only a nice nook but a statement piece in her master bedroom. With natural sunlight beaming through and luxurious curtains, who wouldn&#8217;t want to curl up with a good book and spend a relaxing afternoon?</p>
<h3>Bedroom accent walls draw the eye</h3>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49071 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28.jpg" alt="master bedroom with black and white painted mural behind bed" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>): A custom mural as a bedroom accent wall</span></p>
<p>Making a bold design statement is always an in-vogue idea in any master bedroom. A statement or accent wall has been around for a while—and they are not going anywhere. You can add an accent color with paint. Or, take it up a notch with a paneling.  <a href="https://sweeten.com/portfolio/black-steel-accented-dining-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovators Mitzie and Jenifer </a>decided on blue paneling to give the room depth and character. The wall also turned attention away from existing buildouts in each corner of the room and a recessed area that could not be reconfigured.  Also, in case you were wondering, the contractor used satin-finish paint to make the wall pop even more.</p>
<p>And yet another <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-hamptons-bays-beach-house-renovation-gets-a-pop-art-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten renovator</a> decided to add an accent wall—a customized one. An artist, Katy decided to use her creativity in the design. She painted a bold, black-and-white brush-stroke mural behind the bed. &#8220;Seeing my murals and paintings transform the house has been incredible,&#8221; she said.</p>
<h3>Built-in shelves flank the bed</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43898 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9.jpg" alt="Attic master bedroom with custom built-in shelves surrounding bed" width="1000" height="665" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Built-ins are not just for the library or living room. Including built-in shelves to a master bedroom not only helps with storage but adds a point of interest. In the master bedroom above, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/renovate-attic-pelham-westchester-new-topper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">homeowners Kusum and David</a> asked their Sweeten contractor to install custom built-ins since they were limited on space. They decided on open shelving with a drawer at the bottom in order to maximize the storage potential. In addition, the odd-shaped room also called for a built-in dresser to utilize every nook and cranny.</p>
<h3>Wall-to-wall wallpaper</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39881 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-13.jpg" alt="master bedroom with textured tan hemp wallpaper" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Wallpaper is an easy way to elevate the design of any master bedroom. The key to <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picking the right one</a> really lies in your personal aesthetic. Overall, stay true to your style, whether that&#8217;s bold or more subtle. Another approach to consider is selecting textured wallpaper, which adds a sense of movement and purpose. This <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovator</a> (above) went for a hemp-textured wallpaper. Specifically:  Bermuda Hemp in Elephant #5260 from <a href="https://www.phillipjeffries.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phillip Jeffries</a>.  No matter which paper you choose, keep true to your design aesthetic and you won&#8217;t go wrong.</p>
<h3>Minimalist master bedrooms go clean and simple</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39731 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17.jpg" alt="Minimalist baster bedroom with white walls and black window frame" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Whitney&#8217;s minimalist bedroom</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48341 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-15.jpg" alt="Minimalist master bedroom with slanted white ceiling and walls" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-15.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-15-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Kirsty&#8217;s master bedroom</span></p>
<p>Sometimes keeping it simple is best. That usually translates to neutral colors, minimal furniture, and little ornamentation on the walls. Another bonus of the less-is-more approach: having a space that is mostly clutter-free can make you calm and more relaxed. Ultimately, that&#8217;s just what a bedroom should be—a serene, inviting space. For <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/first-time-condo-renovation-flatiron/">Sweeten renovator Whitney</a>, that was exactly her vision. She chose light wood flooring that appears to reflect the incoming sunlight, having an illuminating effect on the bedroom. White walls are accented by a black window frame. Art is leaned up against the wall instead of hung. And little furniture works to make the space more open. This master bedroom is just the right combination of minimalism and style.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovator Kirsty</a> had the same idea: minimal all the way. When she redid her house in Los Angeles, she, too, wanted a clean aesthetic, especially for her bedroom. She achieved this through natural wood doors and headboard as well as little to no furniture in the room. She used artwork to draw the eye in but it is also in neutral tones and hues.</p>

			<h2>These white subway tile kitchens showcase 5 fresh takes on a classic trend</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40333 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-09.jpg" alt="Image of a white subway tile kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-09-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p>Many homeowners choose classic white subway tiles to give their kitchens a polished finish. They&#8217;re a versatile design feature, with styles and textures found in multiple materials like marble, glass, and ceramic. They also have many uses, most frequently as statement pieces in backsplashes, or as a complete wall design. Ultimately, white subway tiles have become popular because they offer a minimalist look that matches all styles and sizes of kitchens.</p>
<p>Here, we&#8217;re sharing 6 Sweeten kitchen renovations that used white subway tiles in inspiring ways.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Cleverly-disguised kitchen cabinets</h3>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44867 mb-0 size-full" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-Apt-11.gif" alt="white subway tile kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></h3>
<p>When <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowners Tara and Brian </a>decided it was time to update their home, they knew they wanted a modern atmosphere. They were done with their dated oak cabinets and cluttered room design and were ready for a <a href="https://www.bhg.com/kitchen/styles/modern/minimalist-kitchen-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more minimalist, open layout</a>. To get there, they added a glossy white subway tile backsplash that extends through an entire wall. The subway tiles also double as doors to their hidden pantry, giving an otherwise incognito cabinet a sleek finish.</p>
<h3>A marble take on white subway tiles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23867 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14.gif" alt="marble subway tile kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/loft-apartment-inside-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner Romuald</a> renovated his Elmhurst home to achieve an open concept cook space. In the kitchen, he opened up the walls to get a direct sightline across the ground floor. Before, his kitchen was dark and closed off. Now, a marble subway tile kitchen backsplash brings a clean look to the room.</p>
<h3>A chevron-patterned subway tile enriches a kitchen</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovating-to-stay-in-a-beloved-neighborhood/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22790 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg" alt="chevron-patterned white subway tile kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 10 years of residency, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovating-to-stay-in-a-beloved-neighborhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim and Igor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were ready to upgrade their Carroll Gardens kitchen. Kim &#8220;knew from the get-go&#8221; that she wanted a white kitchen. So, the main focus of their renovation was reducing the dull and uninviting feel while bringing in </span><a href="https://www.homesandgardens.com/news/two-tone-kitchen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more dual-tone white &amp; gray pieces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They added chevron-patterned subway tiles that had the right textured element to give them the modern and vibrant look they dreamed of. </span></p>
<h3>Glass subway tiles energize a small kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25335 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="glass subway tile kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/56-square-feet-small-kitchen-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner Jill</a> wanted to renovate her 56-square-foot Yorkville kitchen after 20 years of use. Her goal was to update the design and personalize the small space to better suit her lifestyle. With help from her Sweeten contractor, Jill selected a subway tile for her backsplash in an elegant glass finish. This not only gave her kitchen an upscale, clean look but also visually expanded its small square footage.</p>
<h3>A white-tiled kitchen with a retro-industrial feel</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44329 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-03.jpg" alt="white subway tile kitchen " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan and Mike </a>were inspired by their building’s historical industrial architecture and decided to renovate their kitchen to achieve that same theme. In order to obtain this, they added classic white subway tiles that line the walls as a way to contrast the darker cabinets. This tiling <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/a-quick-fix-brightens-a-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brightened up the space </a>and softened the surrounding retro-industrial aesthetic.</p>

<p>Emily Henderson, TV host and namesake behind the <a href="https://stylebyemilyhenderson.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Style By Emily Henderson</a> blog, and Sweeten&#8217;s founder, Jean Brownhill, have a conversation on making your best home through remodeling and design. Read some of Emily&#8217;s &#8220;aha!&#8221; interior design tricks and insight below.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Jean: Emily, what are your interior design tips to get more space or maximize small spaces?</h3>
<p><strong>Emily:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Multi-functional furniture</span></p>
<p>Think double-duty, for sure—ottomans with storage, sideboards that have cabinets. When you’re looking for furniture, think, “could this also have another function, a storage function?” That definitely helps.</p>
<p>In a smaller space, having less furniture will help you. It’s easy to be like,  &#8220;Well, this is a small sofa and then I have this small chair and this small chair…” and sometimes all of that will actually end up making the room look smaller because it’s busier. Think about bringing as little contrast as possible if you’re trying to make a room feel and look bigger.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid a focal wall</span></p>
<p>Sometimes the desire is to have a focal wall, which I totally get. But it does chop up the space. It makes your eye feel like the space is smaller when it’s chopped up. We have an accent wall rule, and we&#8217;ve blogged about it before…essentially, if it&#8217;s a niche, if it&#8217;s a dedicated space that architecturally is addressed differently, then that&#8217;s a great opportunity for an accent wall. But if you have four walls in a room, don&#8217;t just paint one a different color—it just kind of chops up the space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24.jpg" alt="studio bedroom and living room" width="800" height="538" class="alignnone wp-image-48381 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24-600x404.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners hired designer Julia Oddo for their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/small-space-renovation-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studio apartment renovation</a></p>
<h3>Jean: When and who should be hiring a designer?</h3>
<p><strong>Emily:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lack of time and experience</span></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re doing a pretty big renovation, whether it&#8217;s a whole house or even just doing your kitchen, and you truly don&#8217;t have the time, the desire, or experience, it&#8217;s a good idea to<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> think about hiring an interior designer</a> strictly because you&#8217;re going to make mistakes. Even we make mistakes all the time. It&#8217;s a luxury service, but I would say if you don&#8217;t have the time to really do the research to figure out how you want it to look and have the experience, then an interior designer will benefit you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Design on the next level</span></p>
<p>Hiring an interior designer will take your house to the next level. You&#8217;ll probably get more custom pieces. It&#8217;ll look more unique than if you bought all from different big box stores, but you don&#8217;t have to do it. You truly don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The internet has made an average homeowner able to buy a great sofa. And because of Pinterest and Instagram, people can really do it themselves. Again, you&#8217;re still going to probably make some mistakes, but that&#8217;s okay. Whereas I think 30, 40 years ago, they didn&#8217;t have the resources. We didn&#8217;t have the stores.</p>
<p><strong>Jean:</strong> You always talk about how you want your house to feel. Interior designers don’t just create a vibe. They deal with the elements of the actual things that you feel and touch, like the sofas and pillows.</p>
<p><strong>Emily:</strong> Yeah, and that&#8217;s my favorite stuff for sure. It&#8217;s the layering that makes it feel like a unique home.</p>
<h3>Jean: How do we save time and money designing a home?</h3>
<p><strong>Emily:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do the preliminary work</span></p>
<p>If you’re working with an interior designer, and you have a pretty clear vision, that saves them a lot of guessing, a lot of back and forth. If you have a sofa you love, show it to them, because they&#8217;re going to source 10 different sofas to show to you and that takes time. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-interior-design-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interior designer&#8217;s costs</a> for their time is usually on an hourly basis. So I think the more work you can do upfront, the better.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spend on &#8220;wow&#8221; pieces</span></p>
<p>I have a different philosophy on where to splurge and save than everybody I know. These days there are very good sofas out there that are not that expensive that will also last for years. I feel like you should splurge on the conversation pieces like that amazing rug that nobody else has or a really great piece of art that will create a conversation. They&#8217;re the pieces you typically see that are vintage or custom, where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh my God, I need&#8230;&#8221; That is going to just shift everything in the room and elevate everything.</p>
<h3>Jean: Can you tell us what to do with blank or boring walls?</h3>
<p><strong>Emily:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personality for each wall</span></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of awesome DIY artwork out there right now. I do have a rule about decorating your walls. When designing a room, address every wall differently with a different style. One wall might be a gallery wall, one might be a mirror, one might be a diptych, and one might be a sculpture. Whether it&#8217;s a gallery, big single art piece or diptych, grid, sculpture, or mirror, those are the five go-to&#8217;s that we use to address all walls.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled.jpg" alt="dining area with gallery wall and open shelves above a piano" width="1707" height="2560" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47432" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s dining area and <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gallery wall</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Art is the key</span></p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re looking around and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I have one small piece on that, one small piece on that wall,&#8221; that might be something that you could change pretty easily that would make your house feel more styled, more pulled together. Also, art is the number one way to make your house feel like a unique, personalized space for sure.</p>

<h3>Two sisters decide to renovate, again</h3>
<p>Prior to our new home, we were living in a smaller apartment in Sutton Place in Manhattan that was renovated and converted from a studio to a one-bedroom. After five years there, we needed more space but wanted to stay in the neighborhood and ideally find something that required some work. We liked creating a space that is uniquely our own and feels like a home.</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<h3>The floorplan evens out</h3>
<p>A lot of people are surprised by two millennial siblings, planning a whole apartment remodel, with a traditional style. Our design influence comes from Chinoiserie and a lot of ginger jars! We love bold patterns and color: the only thing painted white is the kitchen ceiling. Our home is filled with antiques we’ve bought and a number of items from our grandmother’s house.</p>

<p>The original layout had changed into a space that wasn&#8217;t well-utilized. The biggest challenge was bringing back the layout to its original form while making tweaks of our own and highlighting the great view. Our main goals were to create a second bedroom, build a large closet for our endless clothes, and have a dining space large enough to fit a table for entertaining. The decor would pull it all together through striking colors, textures, and the cozy feel.</p>

<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Wood floors are so classic, you really can’t go wrong, so we weren’t as concerned with getting it just right.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The entryway closet was a bit of an eyesore. We decided to keep it and make it work in the dining area as a coat/linen closet. We designed the mirrored doors and it became a great way to add extra light and depth to the space.</p>
<p>The size of the master bedroom was cut down to allocate space for a shared 7’x10’ walk-in clothes closet. Storage is super important in a New York apartment so we wanted to make sure we had as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Seeking simplicity with character</h3>
<p>The kitchen stayed simple by choosing white cabinets and a white quartz countertop. We avoided a trendy cabinet style to ensure a classic look for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home value resale</a>. A green, subway tile backsplash, inspired by The Polo Bar, gave a pop of color. All of the fixtures were in a gold finish. The kitchen counter wrapped around and into the dining area with extra cabinets and a wine rack added below it. We like the aesthetics of it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43491" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14.jpg" alt="green tile" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-43493 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>In the bathroom, we went for a standard white subway tile in the shower for resale consideration. It’s inexpensive, easy to maintain, and a classic material that won’t go out of style. Spending less on the subway tile also meant we could spend more on the marble basketweave floor tile, which adds a lot of character.</p>
<p>Initially, we were going to salvage the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/repair-protect-wood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wood floors</a>. When we realized we couldn’t, we had to quickly choose a new style and decided on a medium finish with narrow planks. Wood floors are so classic, you really can’t go wrong, so we weren’t as concerned with getting it just right.</p>
<p>We managed the project while working full-time jobs. We had an idea of what we wanted but the execution for most of it was in real-time. Fortunately, we work very close to home so we were able to run over at lunchtime and after work to answer questions, make decisions, and check on the overall progress.</p>

<h3>The right general contractor communicates</h3>
<p>Constant communication with our Sweeten contractor was key! Although we communicated exactly what we wanted, it’s only natural that things get lost in translation. To keep everyone on the same page, we had weekly calls or meetings to make sure everything was getting done right and on time. We would also send checklists of completed tasks and any pending items.</p>
<p>Choosing the right contractor is the biggest question when starting a project. Having a referral or reputable source (like Sweeten!) is always a good idea. You don’t always have the luxury of starting from scratch where every detail is of your own choosing, especially in New York, so we really wanted to capitalize on that.</p>
<p>It’s exciting to finally have a dining room to sit and have meals (another NYC luxury). The wallpaper, chandelier, and doors were a must, since day one. We feel so happy to be settled and comfortable but are also really proud of how our ideas translated into exactly what we envisioned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An age-old material adds texture to any space</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some structural elements of a home can offer a peek into its past. Consider the brick wall, a material brimming with warmth and character that&#8217;s steeped in history. With <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors—these five homeowners uncovered this long-forgotten detail hiding behind the walls of their homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27228 mb-0 size-chrono" title="exposed brick in the dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="exposed brick" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While renovating the downstairs bath, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alicia and Ed’s</a> contractor discovered well-preserved brick along one wall. The revelation encouraged the couple to see if the material in the living room was in just as good condition. After ripping down the sheetrock and finding beautiful brick, the couple fell in love with the feature and said that unearthing it was worth the expense and impact on the timeline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-24689" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a loft apartment that was once a carriage house, exposed brick was the focal point of the living room. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meg and Brett</a> loved it and wanted to see what else lurked behind the walls. Wherever the drywall was hollow, they drilled a hole to see what lay underneath. The process allowed the couple to find brick, beams, and columns, which they worked to expose. Not only did the original architecture reveal the home’s provenance, but some of the beams had initials carved in them, and a horsehair or two caught within the wood!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28813 size-chrono" title="exposed brick" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="exposed brick" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28935 mb-0 size-chrono" title="painted brick" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="exposed brick" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fixing electrical components in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miguel’s</a> apartment led his contractor to uncover brick that started in the bedroom and continued through the living room and kitchen. The apartment lacked charm before the discovery, feeling more like a white box than a proper home. Miguel jumped at the chance to show off the brick, leaving it in its natural state in the bedroom, and adding white paint in the living room where the material was of poor quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21670 size-chrono" title="exposed brick in the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-08-8-723x1085.jpg" alt="Plants and exposed brick wall" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/fashion-designer-renovates-match-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine</a> planned on keeping her apartment minimalist in design, but rather than painting the exposed brick white to match her floors, she left them bare. The rough-hewn surfaces add a natural quality, anchoring the sparse decor and color palette. With the brick in the living room, Christine took inspiration from a Moroccan riad—a traditional style of house with an interior garden—and filled the space with greenery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Giovanni_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28936 mb-0 size-chrono" title="brick structural wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Giovanni_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg" alt="exposed brick" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to swap his high-rise home for something with history, <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/tired-kitchen-gets-jumpstart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giovanni</a> found a studio apartment in an old townhouse in Brooklyn. The walls were covered in plaster, but Giovanni remained hopeful that bricks might lay beneath the surface. His contractor was able to uncover structural brick by breaking off the plaster, instantly restoring the lost charm and character of the home.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">From pendant lighting to LED strips, here&#8217;s a primer on kitchen lighting</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchen planning often seems to be concentrated on the “big” stuff—cabinets, appliances, that gorgeous stone countertop you’ve had your heart set on. Lighting is not exactly overlooked, but it typically plays a secondary role to the more expensive and showy features. However, lights are a pivotal part of what makes the elements of a room work, and work beautifully. This is particularly true in the kitchen, where the proper brightness needs to be effective </span><span class="s1"><i>and</i></span> practical, illuminating all the key areas of what is primarily a work environment. It should also bring to life the unique beauty of all the materials and details. A thoughtful mix of ambient, task, and accent lighting will do the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Begin your plan by re-examining how you use the kitchen and what you do where. Besides cooking and eating, it’s probably a room for socializing as well as office and schoolwork, and crafts or hobbies. Size, too will determine choice as well as placement. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ambient lighting</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also referred to as general lighting, this type of illumination serves to light the entire space while creating a welcoming mood. The lighting should be bright but diffused, not focused like task lighting (see below). Overhead recessed lighting is the most common choice to brighten the space and eliminate shadows and glare while creating a warm environment. Dimmers are a must, and will help you control the degree of brightness at any given point during the day or activity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your kitchen is small, a chandelier or group of pendants above the eating area along with an overhead light in the work triangle could do the job for general illumination. However, if your kitchen is very large, with one or more islands, and part of a great room, then recessed lights will also serve to brighten transitional spaces, like a hallway into the kitchen, or the area between the island and clean-up and cooking areas.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Task lighting</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essential for any area where work takes place, task lighting assures a safe place in which to cut vegetables, wash dishes, or pay bills for that matter. For long runs of countertop, undercabinet lighting such as LED strips are ideal: they are hidden from view and don’t shine in anyone’s eyes, even from a distance, and the light is directed right on the counter. LED strips or ropes also stay cool and last a long time before requiring replacement. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For an island or breakfast bar, you can install recessed spotlights, or opt for a pendant (or cluster of pendants), to bring warm, focused lighting when you want to switch to a softer atmosphere once the meal is ready. Pendants also allow you style statement opportunities, with plenty of choices for shades and bulbs, and arrangements. Plan to place these and recessed lights on dimmers, too, so you can readily control their intensity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will need focused light over the sink; if the basin is placed under a window, opt for a recessed light in the ceiling overhead that you can control with its own switch. This is a good light to leave on solo in the kitchen after dark, as it lights the way to get a glass of water or return a dish from an evening snack.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interior lighting is now available for drawers, too. LEDs, like <a href="https://www.hafele.com/us/en/" target="_blank">Häfele</a>&#8216;s Loox system, illuminate deep corners, so you don’t have to go digging for that errant fork.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Task lighting can also be served by a few well-placed lamps, say, a floor lamp in the corner of a dining nook where you might also sit to do paperwork or work on a laptop, or a table lamp in a small desk area, if you want a more furnished look.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Accent lighting</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name indicates, this type of lighting serves to single out features that deserve attention for their decorative qualities; it can also do double duty for task lighting. Most typical options are LED strips at the backs of shelves or cabinets to create a wash of light, highlighting dishware, glasses, or collections or an architectural detail like carved molding. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These strips also make a striking statement under the perimeter of a glass counter or a toe kick (the area between the base cabinet and the floor), to create visual interest and, in the case of the counter, keep someone from bumping into it late at night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>An important word about light switch placement</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan for light switches at each entry point to the kitchen, to light the way to your destination. Have separate switches installed for each light area—each individual task area as well as the general lighting—to provide the greatest flexibility. Make sure your contractor includes dimmers. You might also want to investigate electronic sensors for automatic control and safety at night.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>Feeling stuck in your renovation? Look to the stars for inspiration</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your home needs a renovation, and you’re not sure where to start, why not consult the celestial bodies for some answers? Whether your sign is connected to fire, water, earth or air, each element leans toward certain colors, styles, or texture preferences. In order to prepare you for what lies ahead, we’ve compiled the best materials and techniques for each of the 12 zodiac signs. Read on to reveal what the stars say about your renovation.</span></p>

<p><strong>Aquarius</strong> (January 20-February 18)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Air</p>
<p>You prefer to keep things open, so having fewer partitioned rooms should be the first thing on your punch list. Connecting your living spaces, like your dining and living room, is a great way to create an airy and inviting home.</p>

<p><strong>Pisces</strong> (February 19-March 20)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Water</p>
<p>You&#8217;re someone with a big imagination who prefers the path of least resistance. Surrounding yourself with brightly colored and glossy materials will provide endless inspiration to keep your creativity flowing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20746 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />

<p><strong>Aries</strong> (March 21-April 19)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Fire</p>
<p>You have a strong sense of self and you like to put your own stamp on things. Texture and color combined can create a bold look and let you stand out from the rest of the pack.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22374 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-02" width="723" height="482" /><br />

<p><strong>Taurus</strong> (April 20-May 20)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Earth</p>
<p>One might say you’re bullheaded, but that’s just another way of saying that you have strong opinions, which is a good thing when it comes to design. With an inclination towards keeping things simple, incorporating natural materials like soapstone into your home is the way to go.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22279 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-05_Crop-723x492.jpg" alt="Open shelving in white and wood kitchen" width="723" height="492" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-05_Crop-723x492.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-05_Crop-300x204.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-05_Crop-600x409.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-05_Crop.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />

<p><strong>Gemini</strong> (May 21-June 20)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Air</p>
<p>You’re someone who’s unpredictable and lives for variety, so it only makes sense that you’d want to keep things open to the winds of change. Open shelving lets you mix things up, switching out your display with each passing season or mood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22296 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_HenryApt-05_Crop-723x506.jpg" alt="Modern bathroom with silver accents" width="723" height="506" /><br />

<p><strong>Cancer</strong> (June 21-July 22)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Water</p>
<p>As a careful planner who prefers to keep things consistent, you’re not one to rock the boat. Try rippled tile for an effect that suggests flowing water to help you keep your cool.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22106 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-723x506.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="506" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-723x506.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-300x210.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1-600x420.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />

</strong><strong><br />
Leo</strong> (July 23-August 22)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Fire</p>
<p>Your sign displays a lot of confidence and pride, and you find yourself always wanting to be the center of attention. Nothing says &#8220;look at me!&#8221; like a saturated pop of color. An accent wall in Hamilton Blue can be a conversation-starter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20687 mb-10 size-chrono" title="nursery renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-13.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />

<p><strong>Virgo</strong> (August 23-September 22)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Earth</p>
<p>As someone who is well-organized and prefers order and balance, you feel a connection with the natural world. Custom shelving can add order and a sense of calm to any room.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22286 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Anne_Kitchen-02_Crop-723x508.jpg" alt="Galley kitchen with cutout" width="723" height="508" /><br />
<span class="img-label">A <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/annes-sweetened-willow-street-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/">kitchen renovation</a> in Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><strong>Libra</strong> (September 23-October 22)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Air</p>
<p>You&#8217;re level-headed, and having your home be in harmony is very important to you. A cutout can connect your living spaces, bridging the gap between separate rooms to let them harmonize with one another.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22375 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-05-1-723x509.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="509" /><br />

<p><strong>Scorpio</strong> (October 23-November 21)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Water</p>
<p>Some might say you&#8217;re intense, and you often find yourself laser-focused on the next task in front of you. High-gloss and reflective finishes around your home can keep you in touch with the world around you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20411 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-1-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />

<p><strong>Sagittarius</strong> (November 22-December 21)<br />
Element: Fire</p>
<p>You’re a confident, straightforward person who doesn&#8217;t need to embellish your home to feel good about yourself. Soft hues, like this wall color in Gobi Desert, can be a great way to reflect that self-assuredness.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22291 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-08_Crop-723x506.jpg" alt="Modern kitchen with granite countertop" width="723" height="506" /><br />

<p><strong>Capricorn</strong> (December 22-January 19)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Air</p>
<p>You&#8217;re a master of self-discipline with a penchant for realism. When it comes to designing your home, granite is a solid choice that will stand the test of time.</p>
