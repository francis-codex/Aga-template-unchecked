										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gregg and Kelly were right where they wanted to be. The couple had just closed on a sought-after two-bedroom in a very popular Brooklyn co-op. But there was a big nagging problem lurking in the &#8220;heartbeat&#8221; of their home: severely dated decor wrapped in really bad wiring. The new homeowners just couldn’t focus on a future in their new apartment when the kitchen was so obviously stuck in the dark. Read on down for Gregg’s take on their sleek new kitchen renovation! </span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/gregg-kellys-sweetened-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17774" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gregg-kitchen.jpg" alt="gregg-kitchen" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gregg-kitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gregg-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Gregg, Brooklyn homeowner</span></i><span id="more-17761"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For about one year, Kelly and I searched all over Brooklyn to not only find the perfect apartment, but also the perfect neighborhood. The more we saw, the more our search started to narrow to Clinton Hill and the Clinton Hill Co-ops in particular. Located on what I think is one of the most beautiful streets in Brooklyn, the Clinton Hill Co-op campus had everything we were looking for: a sensible layout, sturdy prewar structure, and great value for the money.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We zero’d in on a two-bedroom unit that was in need of a lot of work. Many of the apartments in the Co-ops have been renovated before; this one never had and it was a mess. In fact, it was so untouched that even the light switches were still push button rather than actual switches. But, having seen numerous posts on Sweeten, we knew the potential of the space and had a vision for what it could be. The first and most important thing for us to get to was the kitchen and dining room area. We </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten and found </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Mick</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help us with the project.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17773" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were a few things we really wanted. First, we wanted something light and airy. Our old apartment only had two windows and both were in constant shadow, so we wanted something that really allowed the light to filter into the living space. We also wanted a place that we could host people in and have a couple of different gathering spots. And finally, I wanted a place that would be easy to cook in and easy for storage. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mick guided us through all that needed to be done, had suggestions along the way about how to make the space work even better, and let us know what to expect as things went on. We were lucky to have someone who was so honest and upfront as the apartment was in such bad shape. For instance, after knocking down some of the walls, we really got to see how bad some of the wiring was. Mick walked us through the options and took care of everything. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17775" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With walls down and new wiring installed, we were ready for the fun stuff. We wanted finishes that were clean and bright, again to allow the sunlight to come in and to make it feel fresh and open. We decided to go with modern white IKEA cabinets because of the solid quality and affordable pricing. Mick, as someone who normally creates custom cabinetry, was able to really help us design a plan that would make the cabinets not feel so cookie-cutter. For the countertops, we went with honed black granite because we wanted the look of a soapstone or black marble, but with a little more durability. The stone looks fantastic and is really a great contrast to the high-gloss cabinets. It was Mick who recommended we get a counter-depth fridge in order to keep things more open with clean lines. It turned out to be a great recommendation.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We put in new wood floors ourselves that I think bring some much needed warmth to the space. They are engineered floors and we really liked that they felt lived-in but not in a way that seemed artificial. We wanted something that was matte, had character, but would also be durable. This flooring ticked off all of those boxes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, we couldn’t be more thrilled with the results. The before and after photos really tell the tale. Mick was able to do a fantastic job&#8211;and on budget. Not only that, he has an attention to detail that is very hard to find in many NYC contractors. Most contractors are concerned with getting the job done and that is it &#8211; Mick is concerned with getting the job done and getting it done right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has been several months since the renovation and we both still say “we can’t believe this is actually our apartment”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A creative Brooklyn couple came to Sweeten with an enviable problem: they had a gorgeous townhouse on their hands, big on charm and original details, but a little low on the storage and conveniences that a modern, entrepreneurial family needs. <a href="https://cupofjo.com/2016/02/my-beauty-uniform-kavi-ahuja-moltz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kavi Ahuja Moltz </a>and David Seth Moltz, the fabulous duo behind the small batch perfume and cologne company <a href="https://dsanddurga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D. S. &amp; Durga</a>, loved the rich wood trim that framed each window and the inlaid wood floors that ground each room, but earlier renovations in the kitchen and bathrooms had replaced many original materials with a hodge-podge of finishes. Seeking the skills of a designer and contractor, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to Sweeten, a free service matching homeowners with contractors, and we found their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4877#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> to re-think space and feel in the kitchen and two bathrooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-island-undermount-sink" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48507 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07.jpg" alt="White kitchen island with undermount sink and multifunctional faucet facing kitchen with abstract backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="668" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span id="more-17681"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Clinton Hill home presented an open kitchen plan with a large center island that had been updated with telltale features in the last decade: subway tile and a mix of wood finishes had been fit into an archway in the kitchen and pre-war moldings with gothic-inspired edges framed the oversized windows and a fridge nook. Storage was limited to two strips of base cabinetry and the butcher block counters added a third wood finish to the original floors and architectural details. Updates in the bathroom were similarly out of sync with the home’s original design, and a mix of modern tile, faux wood finishes, and slim storage left this family without a lot of storage options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor set out to preserve the most striking original floor and molding details and also push elements of the home toward a highly inventive and contemporary aesthetic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brown-hardwood-floor-kitchen-bathroom-before" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48518 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1.jpg" alt="Brown hardwood floored open kitchen and bathroom with tempered shower glass door before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
(<em>credit for before photos: <a href="https://www.elliman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</a></em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Without destroying any of those gorgeous hardwood floors, he addressed the most pressing of the to-dos first. The base cabinets were completely removed and replaced with a full wall of semi-gloss, flat front, white cabinetry from HenryBuilt with hidden hardware, framing the striking new <a href="https://www.subzero-wolf.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolf</a> stove. While they did lose the original wall pocket trimmed in molding that housed the fridge, the new <a href="https://henrybuilt.com/page/henrybuilt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HenryBuilt</a> cabinets are far better suited for pantry purposes, and the new fridge was re-located to the right of the stove, camouflaged seamlessly with paneling. White stone composite counters replaced the butcher’s block, and a larger island replaced the former, keeping a similar silhouette with a mahogany base and ample knee space for diners. The stainless undermount sink was also enlarged, with a dramatic multi-functional chrome faucet, a standard workhorse behind the scenes in most restaurants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The backsplash is where the real drama resides. White subway tiles were replaced with a kaleidoscope of black, gray, and white triangular tiles creating quite the abstract pop of modernity to the new kitchen that’s now a contemporary haven trimmed in pre-war luxe.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In each of the two bathrooms, the crew took a related design approach to tie in inspiration across eras, addressing the finishes without changing the footprint entirely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In one full bath, tile again takes center stage with cement <a href="https://www.marrakechdesign.se/dandelion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dandelion tile</a> in Lawn/Milk on the floors. These hex tiles with watercolor edges and abstract white lines depicting sunbursts replaced the previous, more subdued flooring. Simple white hex tile grounds the walk-in shower, and classic white subway tile stacked in a herringbone pattern extends up and around the walls. Frameless glass shower doors, a glossy lacquered double vanity with deep drawer storage, and a heated towel rack perfect this stylish high-low mix of materials. And because no detail was overlooked by this stylish couple, they opted for polished brass light fixtures to offset the muted tones and white on white textures.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kids’ bath, a parallel mix of white and gray shapes work equally simply to create a clean and bright space. White hex floor tile and contrasting gray grout is echoed with industrial white subway wall tile and more contrasting grout. Their Sweeten contractor made room for a new tub and double vanity, and added extra towel bar storage.</p>
