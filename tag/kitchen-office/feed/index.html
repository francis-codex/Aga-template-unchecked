			<h2>Sweeten homeowners make work-from-home spaces permanent fixtures</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56474 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/116726-Sally-Morgridge-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="office kitchen with floral wallpaper" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/116726-Sally-Morgridge-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/116726-Sally-Morgridge-Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/116726-Sally-Morgridge-Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sally and Aaron&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/office-kitchen-becomes-a-family-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home office remodel</a></p>
<p>Homeowners have been earnest in creating home offices for keeps. No longer just a temporary notion, working from home requires a dependable go-to space to fit an organizational system.</p>
<p>Whether you have a whole room or a nook to use, creating a functional space is possible. Below, Sweeten homeowners transform closets, basements, and small sections in kitchens into productive workspaces.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Kitchen office space</h3>
<p class="p1">As the hub of the home, a home office in the kitchen makes it available to the whole family. Even the most compact desk with a drawer is useful to sit and jot a note or look through a recipe.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg" alt="open kitchen with home office and dining space" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40958" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Out of the whole apartment remodel, Chris’ favorite part was the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/family-homecoming-hudson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in home office desk</a>. Erin and Chris’ design-build firm created an organized drawer and cabinet system matching the finishes of the kitchen. It was just right as a creative space. An organized system handled the constant flow of homework, art supplies, and collections.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-workspace-open-shelves" class="alignnone wp-image-44768 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Randy-Office.jpg" alt="white workspace with open shelves and white cabinets and golden framed chair after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Randy-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Randy-Office-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Randy-Office-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A separate office wasn’t in the cards for Laura and Randy, but they </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found a solution: a kitchen desk niche</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s right off the main kitchen area and matches the rest of the white cabinetry. Bold, patterned wallpaper gives the desk a sense of separation from the rest of the kitchen, too.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/116726-Sally-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="Home office kitchen with Gray cabinets with matte black hardware" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56741" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/116726-Sally-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/116726-Sally-Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/116726-Sally-Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With both Sally and Aaron working from home, a proper <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/office-kitchen-becomes-a-family-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen office space</a> would have a major impact on their daily lives. The layout they planned gave the galley a continuous flow and a large desk for their kids to use while the parents cooked. In addition, built-in cabinets surround the desk above and along the sides doubling the storage. Pull-out pantry-style doors hold stationery and desk supplies. Sally and Aaron spent $45,000–$50,000 on their new kitchen renovation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="patterned-floor-blue-wallpaper" class="alignnone wp-image-44769 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mollie-Office.jpg" alt="black and white patterned flooring and blue cabinets and a white desk space and blue wall paper and open white shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mollie-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mollie-Office-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mollie-Office-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With climbing prices in her Fort Greene co-op building, Mollie faced a problem. She could cash out (but deal with moving) or stay where she was. The neighborhood was ideal, but the look of her outdated 500-square-foot studio apartment was not. She decided to remain and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned to a Sweeten contractor</a> to help update her kitchen. Along with bright blue cabinets and dishwasher drawers, the contractor found space for a desk nook. As a result, Mollie chose bold wallpaper to set it apart as an &#8220;office.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="patterned-floor-kitchen-study" class="alignnone wp-image-44770 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Barbra-Office.jpg" alt="patterned black and white floor in a white kitchen and small study with white desk and white closed cabinets after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Barbra-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Barbra-Office-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Barbra-Office-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Barbra and Sean waited almost 10 years before renovating their 1,100-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home in Kensington, Brooklyn</a>. They knew exactly what they needed to make their space work better for their family. Their kitchen had an existing spot for a desk so it seemed <span style="font-weight: 400;">natural to carve out a similar area in their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully remodeled kitchen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as well. The renovators found a desk that fit right into the opening. They also used leftover wallpaper from their foyer to give it a finished look.</span></p>
<h3>A home office remodel transforms spare bedrooms</h3>
<p>If you have a spare bedroom, you can turn it—or just a part of it—into a beautiful workspace like the homeowners below. Bedrooms usually have good lighting, natural or overhead lights.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="wooden-table-brown-chest-of-drawers" class="alignnone wp-image-44765 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jenifer-Office.jpg" alt="wooden table and a brown chest of drawers in an office space with large window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jenifer-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jenifer-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jenifer-Office-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenifer Herrmann, a media executive, and her partner, Mitzie Wong, co-founder of creative design firm </span><a href="https://roarandrabbit.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roar + Rabbit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, found a two-bed, two-bath apartment for sale at a price that left them with a renovation budget. In addition to a kitchen and two bathroom renovations, creating a home office space for Mitzie was a priority for their remodel. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned the second bedroom into a home office</a>. It was the perfect space for Mitzie to separate work from personal life. She decorated it with her art materials, books, and growing plant collection. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="black-highlight-wall-office-space" class="alignnone wp-image-44766 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eric-Office.jpg" alt="black highlight wall in an office space with white desk and black chair and natural wooden floor after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eric-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eric-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eric-Office-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a work-from-home space was essential for first-time renovators Maria and Eric. They planned to include a home office in their 850-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment in Woodside, Queens. The couple worked with their Sweeten contractor <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/scandinavian-kitchen-renovation-crown-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to convert the second bedroom into a small office.</a> They designed it to keep with the Scandinavian-chic aesthetic featured in the other rooms in their home. </span></p>
<h3>Consider a home office remodel in unexpected places</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a saying: &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing that can&#8217;t be done.&#8221; That is just what these Sweeten renovators believed when trying to incorporate a home office into their living spaces. With out-of-the-box thinking, they envisioned spaces that would make working from home more comfortable. We love seeing how they squeezed their desks into creative places!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-16.jpg" alt="home office remodel from a bedroom closet" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44563" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Sweeten homeowner Beth required a fully functional <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-check-all-the-boxes-apartment-for-empty-nesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home office</a> in a dedicated space. In a clever swap, the master bedroom’s large double-door closet was flipped to be used in the second bedroom next door as a home office.</p>
<p>Discuss with your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a> if a work-from-home space is possible with your home layout.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="light-wooden-floor-white-bedroom" class="alignnone wp-image-44772 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cody-Office.jpg" alt="light wooden floor in a white bedroom with tiny study nook with white cabinets after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cody-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cody-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cody-Office-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>This beautiful corner apartment in Hudson Heights, Manhattan was a perfect spot for Marisa and Cody&#8217;s growing family. They turned to Sweeten to help renovate the space, with the goal of joining the kitchen and living area. They wanted the apartment to &#8220;feel open <span style="font-weight: 400;">and modern, but warm and homey at the same time.&#8221; They were able to fit into the design a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/open-kitchen-design-architect/">desk nook in the corner of one room</a>, utilizing the ceiling height by installing storage cabinets above the desktop. </span></p>
<div></div>
<p>What do you do with that little bit of extra room on your stairway landing? If you are creative like Dianna, an advertising agency director, and Todd, a college professor, you create a small office. The couple lives in a 440-square-foot studio alcove apartment, so space efficiency is critical. The office space is made possible by using a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/small-space-renovation-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corner table that fits perfectly on the landing</a> and floating shelves for storage and aesthetic interest.</p>
<h3>Multipurpose rooms combine work and play</h3>
<p>Sometimes you just can&#8217;t justify allocating a whole room to an office. Instead, you have to rethink the traditional concept of a home office and utilize what you have. One way to do this: turn parts of other rooms into your work area. Here, a look at Sweeten renovators who worked with that they had to make efficient, convenient work areas.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Millennial sisters Deanna and Daria found a one-bedroom in Manhattan that they could <span style="font-weight: 400;">convert into two. They worked with a contractor from Sweeten&#8217;s network to <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/millennial-sisters-buy-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revamp the awkwardly laid out floor plan</a> into a charming home. They reduced the size of the master bedroom to make way for a shared 7’ x 10’ closet workstation. The walk-in fit a home office decked out with a simple white desk, blue-fabric chair, and a desk lamp.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44777 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Toby-Office.jpg" alt="a multipurpose room provides work from home space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Toby-Office.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Toby-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Toby-Office-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Since homeowner Toby had working knowledge of design and architecture, he was was very involved in his Manhattan co-op renovation. The living/dining area was open and spacious. Therefore, he set out to lay out a seamless space with multiple functions. He split the room into a dining area, office space, and sitting lounge (not pictured). A truly multi-purpose room!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="green-sofa-pink-pouffe" class="alignnone wp-image-44778 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gordon-Office_DixonProj-NotOurPhotography.jpg" alt="green sofa and pink poufee and cushions in an office space with white open shelves and white desk after renovation" width="1000" height="692" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gordon-Office_DixonProj-NotOurPhotography.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gordon-Office_DixonProj-NotOurPhotography-300x208.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gordon-Office_DixonProj-NotOurPhotography-600x415.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Gordon and Tracy looked to Sweeten to help them find a general contractor who they could trust to turn their townhouse in the Sunnyside Historic Garden District into a more family-friendly space. They knew they needed to use all three floors so, with the help of their contractor, they <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-basement-remodel-boosts-a-petite-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transformed the basement</a> into a dual living and utility/storage space, complete with an office area. The floating desk and shelves enlarge the room, leaving space for an entertainment area, laundry room, and second bathroom.</p>
