<p>When it comes to the many types of renovations, <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> has seen it all! Whether a single-room remodel or adding square footage to a house, Sweeten helps homeowners envision their dream spaces—and then turns them into reality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractors are skilled in many areas of construction. <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-does-sweeten-vet-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We check their licenses</a>, insurance, quality of work, and customer service skills—all so we can ensure your remodel goes smoothly and you get connected with the right team for your project. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support— for free. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some types of projects Sweeten contractors have completed. </span></span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Entire Homes</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40095 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="house exterior" width="1000" height="847" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01-300x254.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01-600x508.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether an apartment, brownstone, or standalone house, Sweeten contractors can take any space and make it uniquely your own. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/tudor-style-house-renovation-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra and Nelson</a> wanted to update their Brooklyn home to fit their new needs. Their kids were grown, so they wanted to focus on the house. They wanted a more convenient living space. With the help of their contractor, they remodeled the kitchen, dining, and living room. Plus, they turned a small office into a beautiful sunroom.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten also transforms apartments for open-concept living or more personal space with walls or partitions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/home-remodeling-tips-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitzie and Jenifer</a> (<em>below</em>). created a seamless flow from one living space to another.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41442" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-15.jpg" alt="living room and kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-15-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Kitchens &amp; Baths</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37769" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12.jpg" alt="New Jersey, Jersey City, renovation, two family, remodel, one family, kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchens and baths are the sweet spots for our contractors. No matter the square footage, each space comes with its own unique set of requirements. Bathrooms and kitchens can be rip-and-replace projects, where the floor plan is not altered or they can be of a larger scope. These types of projects can entail reworking/upgrading electrical and plumbing like was necessary for two smaller <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baths combined as one</a> (<em>below</em>) or Carol and Jon&#8217;s<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-one-family-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweeten kitchen renovation</a> (<em>above</em>).  For these changes, an experienced contractor will call in the right pros to help.</span></p>

<h3>Garage Conversions / ADUs</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26067" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-01-1.jpg" alt="garage renovation after" width="990" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-01-1.jpg 990w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-01-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-01-1-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-01-1-723x487.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" /></p>
<p>Commonly known as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADUs</a> (accessory dwelling units), these converted spaces have become more and more popular. They are a great way to add valuable square footage to your home and create additional, functional spaces. Sweeten contractors converted <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/derelict-garage-finds-purpose-she-shed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle&#8217;s garage</a> (<em>above</em>) and turned <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaime&#8217;s garage</a> into a studio office (<em>below</em>). Each includes bathrooms and kitchenettes.</p>

<p>Exteriors and Additions</p>

<p>When you have a big project, such as updating the exterior of your home or putting on an addition, having the right renovation team is key. <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-home-addition-plan-allows-a-family-of-5-to-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alicia&#8217;s</a> Sweeten contractor added 1,000 square feet to the back of her house (<em>above</em>). Rosaire turned her garage into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/southampton-home-renovation-transforms-garage-into-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living room</a> with a pantry (<em>below</em>).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45248" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4.jpg" alt="hamptons renovation" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p>Molding and Built-ins</p>

<p>Sometimes a room needs a small decorative touch such as trim and millwork. Built-ins are an investment that offers a finished look and functional storage as in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Walter&#8217;s den</a> (<em>above</em>). Trim and molding also set a polished look for every room. A &#8217;60s house receives elegant millwork in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-traditional-house-remodel-offers-a-dose-of-modern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovation below.</a></p>

			<h2>Let your fridge blend neatly into its surroundings with these paneling ideas</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet with paneling in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-44899 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things you notice in a kitchen is the refrigerator. It is big and usually holds souvenir magnets, wedding invitations, or to-do lists. With more homes featuring open-plan layouts, their size and boxy shape interfere with the visual harmony. </span>Paneling and built-ins help disguise a hidden fridge cabinet by integrating it with cabinetry. The look of the entire kitchen is unified.</p>
<p><span class="s1">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he homeowners below pulled off the ever-popular &#8220;refrigerator in cabinet&#8221; design trend with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help of their general contractors</a> from Sweeten. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3>A designer seeks visual harmony</h3>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet in blue kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56510" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<p><span class="s1"></span>Furniture designer, Mitzie and her partner, Jenifer, chose blue and white for their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrated kitchen</a>. The entire space was simplified and unified from what it had been—outdated with a variety of closets. After laying out mood boards and careful planning, a more pleasant transition was created since it opened to the living space. While the <span class="s2">hidden fridge cabinet</span> blends in with the kitchen cabinetry, two symmetrical closets flank the main kitchen—one is a closet, and the other hides the washer and dryer.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Compact size with a hidden fridge cabinet</h3>
<div></div>
<p class="p1">After renovating all of the rental units in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brownstone they purchased</a>, Janet and Jerry kept the 600-square-foot top unit as a pied-à-terre. Scandinavian minimalism and California casualness meant the sight lines throughout the home would have few vertical disruptions. This would apply to the kitchen too. To emphasize the open and airy studio, they hid all appliances in cabinets. The washer/dryer combo, refrigerator, and pull-out freezer all fit under the countertop.</p>
<h3>A custom touch for a fridge</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinets with waterfall island and brown cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56511" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/for-an-east-hampton-beach-house-a-simple-plan-to-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">East Hampton kitchen</a>, homeowners Jennifer and Alex wanted to keep the redesign simple but inviting. They chose to add a large island for entertaining and splurged on a wine fridge and quartz countertops. To make the design more modern, they decided to install an integrated refrigerator, which streamlined the look of the cabinetry.</span></p>
<h3>A hidden fridge cabinet finds a niche<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_04-05-GIF.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></h3>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_04-05-GIF.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27986" title="paneled fridge nestled within a column" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_04-05-GIF.gif" alt="refrigerator paneling" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Ainsley and Simon’s architect discovered that the column in the kitchen was merely decorative, they came up with a plan </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-lightens-up-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to tuck the refrigerator inside</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of it and add custom panels. “You don’t look at it and think it is a fridge at all,” Ainsley said</span><b>.</b></p>
<h3>A seamless built-in</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31161 size-full" title="blue-kitchen-custom-cabinets-light-floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" alt="blue kitchen custom cabinets and light floor overlooking the living area after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren’s front door led </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly into the kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She had to choose between a traditional entryway or a hybrid space that would add square footage to the kitchen. She chose the latter and added a seamless wall of cabinetry featuring a refrigerator in a cabinet, plus a pantry and a coat closet.</span></p>
<h3>A wall of closets<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet in kitchen with white built ins" width="2560" height="1707" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48230" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To improve the flow between their living and kitchen space, Tara and Brian’s contractor came up with an idea to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">move the refrigerator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a wall already outfitted with closets. Now the refrigerator fits right in with the cabinetry, instead of jutting out in the main cooking space.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46413 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-PostRenovation.png" alt="Post a Renovation Project" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-PostRenovation.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-PostRenovation-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3>A hidden fridge cabinet around a structural column</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Casey-fridge-gif-no-watermark.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22901" title="white-long-cabinets-long-handles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Casey-fridge-gif-no-watermark.gif" alt="white long cabinets with long steel handles diving white living room with open book shelf after renovation" width="1000" height="666" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casey and Kumar’s apartment is full of </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clever storage solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to maximize their limited space. The kitchen is one such example thanks to creative built-ins. Custom cabinetry covers the refrigerator along with a neighboring pantry, while the entire unit conceals a structural column.</span></p>
<h3>A clever closet-turned-fridge idea</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet with paneling in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scandinavian chic was the look that homeowners Roxana and Gabriel were going for in their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/">Long Island City loft</a>.  They turned to a Sweeten contractor who was able to update their space to match their minimalistic style. </span><span class="s1">The refrigerator, which moved from the main kitchen area into what was formerly a coat closet proved to be one of the biggest challenges. They had to find the right size appliance and custom cut the Ikea panels to fit.  </span></p>
<h3>A hidden fridge cabinet unifies the kitchen</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44900" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an open concept living arrangement was the biggest goal for this Manhattan couple. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-cool-and-contemporary-kitchen-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took down the dividing wall</a> between the kitchen and family room and replaced it with a custom unit with storage on both sides. It was really important to the couple that they fit a fully integrated Sub-Zero refrigerator and other standard-sized appliances. “They [general contractor team] worked with me through a few kitchen iterations until we found a great open layout that permitted full-size appliances,” the homeowner shared.</span></p>
<h3>A puzzle of panels</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40347" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1496" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05-600x898.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less like appliances, more like furniture—that was Sally’s directive for her kitchen renovation. Her contractor built out a wall of cabinets to hide <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/integrated-white-kitchen-jackson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the refrigerator</a> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a pantry. A set of narrow units were designed to hold brooms and mops, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re ready to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get started on your kitchen</a> or home remodel, discuss with your Sweeten contractor how to incorporate a seamless kitchen.</span></p>

<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to make your fridge look like a cabinet</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">There are several ways to make your fridge look like a cabinet. One way is to buy a panel-ready refrigerator, meaning a fridge that comes pre-fabricated with a panel already on the door, making it look like a set of cabinets. A built-in fridge has a depth of a typical kitchen cabinet–about 24 inches–which keeps it flush with kitchen cabinets once installed, creating a seamless look.</p>

<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to hide a fridge in a kitchen</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">To hide a fridge in a kitchen, consider the fridge itself: can you use a built-in or panel-ready fridge? These types of appliances are created to fit seamlessly with cabinets, avoiding the typical protruding fridge look, and come with panels mounted to the front, mimicking cabinetry. Some homeowners are able to hide their fridges within decorative columns, closets, or other empty spaces within their kitchen.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I found a place that needed work and left me with some budget to renovate. It was challenging to work full-time and oversee the renovation. I tried to keep things simple. </span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The goal for my home was to feel peaceful and light, but I had a pretty tight budget for all that I wanted to accomplish. I focused on fairly humble materials for the renovation that I really liked and how to use them expanding on traditional neutral colors. Work is always visually intensive for me and I wanted a minimal, quiet space to serve as a backdrop for art and objects.</span></p>

<h3>Navigating the renovation plan</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’ve seen many projects through construction in my professional career. However, it never personally affected my life before. The biggest challenge was: would I be able to figure out the design of the space, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire a contractor</a>, and complete the work in the short window I had before I would have to move in? I ended up having to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">move into a construction site</a>. It was a lot to have workers show up every morning and not have a kitchen for many weeks. But you forget the hardships quickly once it’s done and you’re enjoying living there. Thankfully, my partner, at the time, and I were able to help each other through it. He has great taste and helped me the whole way through.</span></p>

<h3>Planning a mixed-materials kitchen</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Mixing wood and laminate as finishes for the cabinetry was an important idea when I was planning the renovation. It emphasizes the volumes and makes the scale a little more human. The countertops and peninsula are concrete, which I like because the material can take any form. However, it&#8217;s also a natural material for a renovation that weathers over time.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’ve always liked appliance garages. It goes back to the fact that my grandparents had one in their very modern kitchen from the &#8217;60s. </span></p>

<h3>Renovating two bathrooms</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I was especially excited about the new bathrooms and having a tub to soak in with a smoked glass panel. From the beginning, I knew the partition would not be clear glass. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44925" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5.jpg" alt="colored shower glass" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44926" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the other bathroom, the general idea was to make a very small space feel as big and open as possible. The renovation materials are pretty simple, but the details and extra showerhead make it feel more special.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2.jpg" alt="double showerheads" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44923" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-3.jpg" alt="double showerheads" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44924" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>A Murphy bed and storage</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the guest bedroom/office, the millwork is a combination of knotty pine and laminate, with a painted wood frame. The red laminate panel breaks up the finish and calls attention to the sliding door. They are both closets and shoe storage.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45036 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Matthew-Closet-Bed-22.gif" alt="renovation materials of laminate panel and Murphy bed" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I made the open shelving in the hallway myself using laminated pieces of reclaimed wood. In a way, it’s the heart of the apartment. I knew I wanted to find a spot for these shelves and the hall was just the right fit. </span><span class="s1">It turns a slice of space that wasn’t so usable into a place for display.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17.jpg" alt="custom closets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44928" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Plants were always an important component. All of the artwork is from friends and acquaintances or people in my community.</span></p>
<h3>A successful partnership with my general contractor</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractor was instrumental in completing the project and helping me do all of the things I wanted to do. At the outset, I got a lot of high bids. He was the one who convinced me it could be done within my budget. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He helped me find the millworker who did all the cabinetry. I did all the designs and drawings for them and selected all the finishes. A Murphy bed kit was purchased online and my contractor built the frame, the custom panels, and installed it.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" class="elementor-button-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Start your renovation</span></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-MasterBedroom-20.jpg" alt="master bedroom" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44943" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-MasterBedroom-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-MasterBedroom-20-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-MasterBedroom-20-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I highly recommend working with design professionals. It’s easy to underestimate the amount of work involved. And don’t get too hung up on specific choices, sometimes it’s easier to just pick something nice that you know you like and move on. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Hallway-1.jpg" alt="bookshelf hallway" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44934" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Hallway-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Hallway-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Hallway-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My new home makes me feel happy and relaxed, and it helps me focus. Living in the space has forced me to declutter and live more simply. And it’s been a good exercise to direct interests for future projects.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Erica</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to believe a wall can have such a profound impact on how two people share space. Our kitchen, once barely big enough for one person, was transformed into what kitchens are meant to be: the heart of the home. Our 800-square-foot Clinton Hill apartment was a loved space, in every sense of the word. My then-fiancé, Joshua, moved in and we decided to renovate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before Joshua joined me, I imagined what would happen if the wall between the living room and kitchen came down. Now that it was two of us, changes seemed necessary. Along with the wall, Joshua also dreamed of replacing the parquet floors with hardwood. (I much preferred parquet so those conversations often ended in agreeing to disagree.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our apartment and all its quirks and beauties were familiar. We knew how we used the space, and which areas needed to become a better fit. We had a<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> budget for the kitchen</a> and vision. But who could we trust to help us move forward with our ideas? Just choosing the right paint color felt overwhelming, so finding the right designer was a challenge. </span></p>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just choosing the right paint color felt overwhelming, so finding the right designer was a challenge.</span></i>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten.com, and selected a firm with design/build services. The general contractor was familiar with the</span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clinton Hill Co-ops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the complexities that exist in these apartments, which were originally constructed in the early 1940s. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44832 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that first warm fall evening, she sat in our living room and listened carefully as we described what we hoped our home would be. We knew we wanted to remove a wall, upgrade the contractor-grade cabinetry, replace the appliances, and install under-cabinet lighting. But we were unsure of the process and the things we could not see. After talking, she immediately popped up and put her superhero design tools to work—her x-ray vision which saw through walls, and her tape measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial sketches removed the wall between the kitchen and the dining area completely, as well as part of the wall between the kitchen and the living room. We were seeking to strike a balance between Joshua’s partiality to completely open spaces and my desire to keep some visual privacy. Receptive to our decision to keep the entire wall between the living room and kitchen intact, the plan removed only the wall between the kitchen and the dining area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our contractor’s keen eye helped us ask so many more questions about the space. I never noticed that the sightlines of our parquet floors were uneven and misaligned. (Joshua was right. We needed to replace the floors.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="tile backsplash" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22219" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized that the space would be transformed in ways I was not expecting the moment she began to speak of light from the kitchen window spilling into the back corner of the living room. With the wall down, of course, the kitchen window would be visible as you enter the apartment. The decision to move the refrigerator out of the original kitchen footprint into what was once a hallway closet provided more options on where the sink and dishwasher could be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew that our Sweeten contractor had expertise in millwork. Our kitchen, filled with unexpected nooks and crannies, was a design dilemma that custom cabinetry could solve. I envisioned white cabinetry to brighten up the kitchen, and we trusted our contractor’s desire to include natural wood via open shelving and some cabinetry with a walnut finish. The shelving she created is the perfect platform for us to display our spices, cookbooks, vases, and the all-important pilon for grinding plantains.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. “I’m so nervous,” I admitted.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a designer, she not only considered ways to bring more storage and surface area into the kitchen, but also a new hue. One afternoon we perused our choices at their warehouse in Queens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every tile seemed to fall short—wrong tint, incorrect size, too dominating, etc. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then Joshua’s eye caught a simple hexagonal tile of soft turquoise blue. This 3D recycled glass tile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complemented the cabinetry color, the wood finish, and it was the right size. The result is a beautiful canvas that pulls the white cabinetry and quartz countertops together. Last, but certainly not least, it serves as a surprising showcase for my favorite red cast iron Dutch oven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="white kitchen walnut built ins" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22216" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-03-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making decisions was easy. Rather than ask us to look at every iteration of countertop or knob, our contractor presented us with a few options, and the design sensibility connected across the space. The nickel handles on the cabinet doors pick up the subtle specks of silver accents in the quartz countertops coordinating well with the steel appliances.  I only noticed it once the kitchen was complete. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to come up with secondary plans for overhead lighting since the ceiling was made of concrete. The</span><a href="https://www.cb2.com/"> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">floor lamp now illuminates our favorite round dining table. The gooseneck sconce creates the perfect corner for working on a laptop at our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/">kitchen peninsula</a>, which can now accommodate someone cooking at the same time. The peninsula also has generous storage on two sides—four very deep drawers and a small cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, when you walk into our apartment, three things jump out at you: the welcoming natural light that flows in from the windows, rich wood elements on the cabinetry and shelving, and the turquoise tile of the backsplash.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44834" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The builders and carpenters of our design-build firm are true craftspeople. The care with which they handled each task was notable. They produced perfectly mitered corners, laid the floor with precision, and cleaned up at the end of each day. We felt like we were in good hands the entire way through. I’d notice an imperfection, and before I could say anything, they had fixed it. Truly top-notch workmanship. They were so thoughtful about the space that it made our decision to stay in the apartment throughout the renovation easy. “Just think of it like camping,” Joshua said one night as we dined in our bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. “I’m so nervous,” I admitted. &#8220;Don’t worry,&#8221; she warmly replied. &#8220;You’re gonna love it.”  Debris and concrete walls filled much of the living area after the first demolition day, but we felt the homeyness of the space. The light from the newly visible window greeted us as we entered in a way we never expected. I looked at Joshua and said, “I didn’t realize how much of me was in this place. Now we get to create this space together.” We couldn’t relish it more!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Take notes from these Sweeten renovators, who expertly renovated their homes to get studio apartment storage</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a studio apartment, closet and storage space is scarce. Your only options for keeping everything in your home are being surrounded by your stuff 24/7 or adopting a minimalist lifestyle and ditching most of your belongings. Neither are perfect solutions. Instead, reimagine the closet, not as a single space where you keep everything, but as multiple spaces throughout your home. Take inspiration from five resourceful renovators who came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors—and see where things can go in a small space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24842 size-chrono" title="bedroom built-in" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-723x482.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>A low cabinet wall can replace closet space for studios</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A low wall of cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/shoe-storage-renovation-87-pairs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew&#8217;s bedroom</a> is the perfect storage alternative to the missing closet, providing ample clothing and shoe storage. Aligning the top of the built-in with the lower half of the window not only keeps it from making the room feel smaller but—<em>voilà!</em>—he now has a window seat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31161 size-chrono" title="blue-kitchen-custom-cabinets-light-floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" alt="blue kitchen custom cabinets and light floor overlooking the living area after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Kitchen cabinetry on a blank wall creates a pseudo pantry &amp; fridge space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Square footage was limited in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren’s tiny kitchen</a>, so she took a blank wall and loaded it up with storage for a hidden pantry and fridge—plus, a coat closet! Tucking everything out of sight provides an uncluttered and sophisticated look.</p>

<h3>Custom wall-hung cabinetry instead of a closet? Yes, please!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lack of closets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-studio-co-op-renovated-for-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Ian’s studio</a> meant that they had to get creative when it came to clothing storage. A custom walnut cabinet in the bedroom area with a mahogany finish takes advantage of empty wall space and adds some visual interest.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30000 size-chrono" title="studio built-ins" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30002 size-chrono" title="studio built-ins" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Sleek storage in the living area expertly blends in</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-rental-studio-becomes-a-pied-a-terre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ying’s studio</a>, she took the average closet build and turned it inside out, adding cabinet storage, shelving, and drawers along the perimeter of the main living area.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-Before-01-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26644 size-chrono" title="custom sliding wardrobe" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-Before-01-02.gif" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>A sliding door that doubles as cleverly hidden clothing storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miguel’s bedroom</a> had a new entryway, but no closet space whatsoever, so he designed a custom sliding door that doubled as wardrobe storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Map out your bathroom storage strategy, using a vanity, shelves, custom built-ins and secret niches</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20746 " title="bathroom storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #76808f;">Laura and Matthew&#8217;s double drawer</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall-hung vanity</a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">With all the fixtures taking up space in the bathroom—sinks, toilet, plus tub or shower—it can be hard to also fit sufficient storage. The vanity alone is rarely enough. And if your space is traditional, with a pedestal sink, the need is greater. However, with smart planning that addresses all the tasks in the bath, you can find the best bathroom storage solutions.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a><span> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Planning your space</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">First, figure out where the fixtures will go. If you’re remodeling, you need to decide if everything stays put or if something moves. Evaluate the floor and wall space to find areas for storage—bathroom cabinets, shelves, or freestanding pieces like furniture. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Bathroom vanity</b></span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Once a simple box with doors and drawers for storing toiletries, the vanity has expanded its capabilities. Manufacturers like <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler</a> and <a href="https://www.duravit.us/html/default/home.us-en.html#/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duravit</a> have introduced built-in internal storage compartments that corral items small, medium and large, while still remaining in arm’s reach. Look for helpful add-ons like electrical outlets, adjustable shelves, and rollout trays. For existing vanities, small acrylic trays and storage boxes at the <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/welcome.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Container Store</a> fit a variety of drawer dimensions. If the bathroom is shared, and you have room for twin vanities instead of one large one, go for it! This allows each occupant to organize the space exactly as he or she wishes. </span><span class="s1">You can identify the type of vanity you want from among the following styles:</span></p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Floating &#8211; This style, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attached to the wall</a>, keeps the floor clear for an open look. You can find models from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.decoracabinets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decorá</a> that include at least one drawer unde</span><span class="s3">r the sink. Expect a small cutout in the middle of the top drawer to clear the plumbing pipes, and still allow room on the left and right. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Freestanding &#8211; The advantage here is the vanity can be moved, with little impact on the wall behind it. It typically goes countertop to floor so there’s more square footage for storage and more door-and-drawer combos. <a class="" href="https://ronbow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ronbow</a> makes vanities with integrated sinks and storage below starting as narrow as 19 inches wide, good to fit twin sets in a small bath. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-laura-and-peters-uptown-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Console styles</a> closely resemble furniture, with shapely legs below the cabinet to create an open effect, and usually incorporate a shelf near the bottom.<br />
<b><br />
</b></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Built-in cabinets</b></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This might be custom cabinetry, similar to what you would order for the kitchen, and from many of the same manufacturers. Or it might be <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bespoke</a>, crafted by a carpenter. Because the unit is built into a wall, it can be as large and long as you want. It also allows the addition of matching units above the counter, on either side of the sink, or between double sinks. You get lots of opportunities to vary door, drawer, and open shelf combos above and below the counter. <a href="https://www.kraftmaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KraftMaid</a> makes a narrow pullout unit with shelves, much like a pantry, to make use of a narrow vertical space. Consider upper cabinets with glass doors as bathroom storage for towels and pretty toiletries in a spa-like display.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Freestanding cabinets</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Similar to kitchen solutions, you can add a cabinet or an open case fitted with shelves in any free space in the bath. Make sure there is clearance for any activity taking place nearby. The advantage here is that the shelves can be adjusted when you wish—to hold a hamper or bath towels on a lower shelf, and smaller personal care items at arm level. Another alternative: a shelf that is not a shelf, such as an étagère—an open-back shelving unit—or one side of a ladder. These repurposed bathroom storage ideas can be found at resale shops or some furniture stores that make small decorative furniture for the bath.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Built-in shelves</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-and-after-ellens-kensington-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shelves</a> maximize <span class="s1">vertical space anywhere there is an open wall space with studs that provide support for attaching the units. Find a place for shelves adjacent to a sink, between sinks, or flanking sinks, above a toilet tank, high up around the perimeter of the ceiling, on a wall a foot or so from the shower, or even a shallow ledge above the vanity. In addition to shelves that match a manufacturer’s vanity collection, options include a wide selection of widths and depths or you can have a carpenter craft shelves to exact specifications. As with vanities, they come in a variety of </span>styles.</p>
<p class="p1">The most versatile, these shelves go anywhere there is sufficient support to attach them: above the toilet, between sinks or flanking sinks, high up around the perimeter of the ceiling, or even a shallow ledge above the vanity.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21983 size-chrono" title="bathroom storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #76808f;">Melina and Fabio&#8217;s gold and marble</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-apartment-gets-dose-luxury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floating shelves</a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Medicine cabinets</strong></span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Why go for a simple mirror when you can capture storage above the sink too? You have two options for storage here, with medicine cabinets that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recess into a wall</a> or mount on the wall, each with the traditional mirrored door that opens out.<br />
<b><br />
*</b>Recessed &#8211; Placed in the shallow wall space between studs, this style comes in versions from 4 to 8 inches deep—big enough to stow rolls of toilet paper. Kohler offers one for less than $100. <a href="https://www.robern.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robern</a> adds options with one, two, or three doors as well as electrical outlets for added organization and versatility.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>*</b>Wall mount &#8211; If you mount the cabinet on the surface of the wall, check out Decorá, which makes a model with storage shelves that slide out from either side, disappearing when not in use.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-19471 size-chrono" title="bathroom storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a><span style="color: #76808f;">Maria and Eric&#8217;s</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-modern-gut-renovation-goes-scandinavian-chic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in niche</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Built-in niche</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This type of shelf is located in a recessed area, such as between studs or even between two cabinets. Built-ins also work on a smaller scale in the shower, in the form of a niche for shampoos and soaps. In the wall above the tub, you can go larger and perhaps fit a couple shelves for a practical display of bath salts and liquid soaps. For visual interest, insert mirrored panels or beadboard on the back surfaces of the niches, or paint them a contrasting color.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Furniture</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">In addition to the small decorative pieces described above, it can be fun to introduce a vintage dresser or bookcase, if you have the room. Use the top to display personal items as well as toiletries. Drawers hold towels, small appliances like a hair dryer or electric razor. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Solve your bathroom storage with some of the suggestions described above, and begin to enjoy the serene space you deserve.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b></b>From homework HQ to a prep and serving station at your next get-together, the kitchen peninsula proves its versatility</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike a kitchen <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island</a>, which has clearance on all sides, a peninsula is joined to the rest of the kitchen, often meeting with a nearby counter or wall to transform an L-shape layout into a much more functional U-shape. It&#8217;s a popular choice among homeowners who don’t have enough space for an island—three feet all around is normally required for comfortable clearance—or prefer to have a more cohesive kitchen layout. It’s also a great way to create visual separation between two spaces in an open plan apartment. You can take the delineation one step further by defining different functions for each side of the peninsula—<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> and prep space on one side and seating on the other. Below, a look at five homeowners, each with a one-of-a-kind kitchen peninsula.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua’s kitchen</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Removing the wall between the kitchen and dining room in Erica and Joshua’s apartment greatly improved the usability of the space. In order to find a compromise between Joshua’s preference for an open plan layout and Erica’s desire to maintain some visual privacy between rooms, a peninsula was built in the kitchen to divide it from the dining area. It was designed with generous storage on both sides in the form of drawers and a cabinet on one end. With bar seating for three, and a gooseneck sconce illuminating one end, the peninsula is the perfect spot to dine or sit down with a laptop. It’s also a good size with plenty of surface space, allowing the couple to use it at the same time—cooking and working face-to-face.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to swap out the awkwardly placed island in their small kitchen, Meredith and Jason’s Sweeten general contractor suggested that they go with a wide peninsula. “As soon as I saw the drawing, I was on board with it,” said Meredith. The new kitchen peninsula doubles counter space while providing a spot for the microwave—<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tucking it out of sight</a>—and plenty of deep drawers for storage. Plus, bar seating on the side facing the dining room allows Meredith to do some work and keep Jason company while he cooks. The white waterfall counter makes it an attractive statement piece as you walk in the front door.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23095 mt-24 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/apartment-party-four-five/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam and Sean’s kitchen</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sam and Sean wanted to make their kitchen feel as large as possible, so a big island was out of the question. Instead, a small peninsula was installed to provide additional prep space and storage while adding some separation between the kitchen and main living area. The custom area was topped with butcher block to create contrast with the white Caesarstone counters used in the rest of the kitchen. Designed with three sides and three distinct purposes in mind, the kitchen peninsula is well-equipped with drawers on one side, bar seating for two on the other, and shelving for storing books on the end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24134 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="3744" height="5616" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02.jpg 3744w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3744px) 100vw, 3744px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-remodel-breaks-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emily and Trey’s kitchen</a> in downtown Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening up Emily and Trey’s cramped kitchen by taking down walls and removing the loft storage above it gave the couple plenty of room to work with. To make the most of the newly opened space, a wide L-shaped peninsula with a Carrara marble countertop was installed with bar seating along one side—quickly becoming a popular spot for Emily’s two kids to hang out while she cooks. Placing the kitchen sink in the peninsula was an ideal location since it faced the windows with lots of natural light and allowed ease of conversation with the family in the living area. The white column holding the intercom could not be moved, so the Sweeten contractor integrated it into the structure, transforming it into a cool architectural element.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-14_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25062 mt-24 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="681" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000-300x204.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_HenryApt-10_1000-600x409.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-henrys-east-village-condo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henry’s kitchen</a> in the West Village, Manhattan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Henry saw the potential to connect his kitchen and living room and took advantage of it, taking down a wall between the rooms and replacing it with a peninsula. Adding this structure extended his kitchen’s L-shape into a more functional and versatile U-shape. Beyond expanding storage and prep space, the main attraction is the range, placed in the center, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hood</a> overhead, making it a more sociable spot from which to cook. As a bonus, Henry tucked a front-loading <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">washer and dryer</a> underneath the peninsula, making them both easily accessible from the living room. That&#8217;s one hard-working peninsula!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Here’s a primer on kitchen cabinets, from custom designs to stock options</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinet construction may well end up being the&nbsp;single biggest expense of your entire renovation, and the results are the most obvious visual proof of your investment, so this can feel like a heavy decision. The challenge (and opportunity) is that your choices are endless, but if you focus on a few key factors, you can find the right cabinets for your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20751 mb-24 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="487" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br>
IKEA cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Matthew&#8217;s kitchen renovation</a>.</p>
<p>While it’s tempting to assume that your budget is the only consideration and while it’s true that custom cabinets can be (much, much) more expensive than stock cabinets, they don’t have to be.&nbsp;Even the cheapest kitchen is an enormous investment, so if budget isn’t necessarily the deciding factor, how should you decide and how can you keep your budget from dictating your choices? First, a few definitions.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color=""></a></p>
<h2>Should you go with custom or pre-fabricated cabinets?</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stock cabinets</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA</a>&nbsp;is widely considered the go-to for stock cabinets. Unlike almost anyone else, they mass-produce a system of set sizes, colors, finishes, and features that you pick and choose. The pieces of your order are pulled from stock supplies and shipped to your home, where you need to handle both the assembly and installation. IKEA keeps its costs low because they are sending your order to you in pieces and because the materials they use are very inexpensive.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pre-fabricated cabinets</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lowes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lowe’s</a>,&nbsp;and other big-box national retailers are distributors of independent lines of cabinets. They offer a semi-custom option: like IKEA, you pick and choose from set sizes, colors, finishes, and features (though national retailers tend to have more options overall). Unlike IKEA, your order is then manufactured and assembled for you so that your cabinets arrive ready for installation. Because you have more choice in materials and construction, the range of prices varies more here. You will probably pay more upfront for higher-quality materials, but you may spend less on labor because the cabinets are assembled before they get to you for installation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Custom cabinets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets are designed and constructed by hand based on your individual design. You define the sizes, materials, finishes, and features and your order is hand-crafted and delivered for installation.&nbsp;Because your choices for materials and construction are endless, the range of material and labor costs is very wide. The costs here are generally distributed between your choice of material and style, labor, and a more personalized design and customer service approach.</p>
<h3><strong>High-end, built-to-order cabinet systems</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A small group of cabinet companies also offer cabinetry systems that are extremely high-end (<a href="https://bulthaup.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulthaup</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.henrybuilt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henrybuilt</a>&nbsp;are examples). These companies are known for beautiful and durable cabinet construction and best-in-industry warranties, but the bare minimum for even&nbsp;a small kitchen can easily exceed <strong>$20,000</strong>, so unlike other categories of cabinet construction, this option is only available if the starting point for your budget allows you to consider it.</p>

Custom cabinets by Henrybuilt in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kavi and David&#8217;s kitchen</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets might be less expensive than you think if your kitchen has limited space, lots of space, or an unusual layout.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a tight kitchen, stock and pre-fabricated cabinets in standard sizes might not be worth the initial material savings because you will need more inventive labor to fit everything in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a large kitchen, extra depth or high ceilings give you an opportunity for additional storage and functionality. Non-standard cabinet heights and depths can bring value to your renovation and re-sale value. Multiple corners, awkward niches, and unusual footprints can be&nbsp;tough to outfit. Stock and pre-fab cabinets in standard sizes may force you to spend money on filler materials, wasted space, and labor for semi-custom adjustments.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“If you have a kitchen with corners or small spaces or an awkward layout, you may not actually save money on the total because you end up paying for filler materials and extra work to pull everything together.” &#8211;&nbsp;Sweeten contractors</i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-24618 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-723x1087.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel cost" width="723" height="1087" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-723x1087.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br>
<span style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets in </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-woodwork-manhattan-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric&#8217;s kitchen</a><span style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;designed and built by his </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a><span style="text-align: justify;">.</span></p>
<h3>Custom cabinets might be worth extra money if you plan to stay for years, have kids or a high-traffic kitchen, or want personalized support.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Semi-custom and custom cabinets offer higher&nbsp;quality materials in sturdier thicknesses that last longer.&nbsp;Particle board and MDF, two common materials for stock cabinets, are susceptible to water and have a shorter life span than plywood and wood. 1/2” particle board will not last as long as 3/4” or 1” furniture-grade plywood cabinet bases, and solid wood doors and drawers will endure tougher handling over the years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets also typically use sturdier construction and joinery methods. Custom cabinetmakers will often use dovetail joints that interlock pieces of wood to distribute weight and stress more evenly, whereas stock nut, bolt, and nail methods isolate wear on a few points. They also offer options for tougher hardware elements like hinges and drawer sliders. In addition, custom cabinet makers generally provide a higher level of design support and customer assistance. They will do site visits, re-designs, and get a real person on the phone with you when you need it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You might be absolutely fine to handle the ordering and delivery of a stock system, but if you hit a roadblock, custom cabinet companies expect to support you and respond personally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Once you order the IKEA materials and you pay for assembly and installation, you’re not far off from a custom option that would last longer and provide more options – for a few extra thousand dollars, you may actually get a much better deal.&nbsp;Each time you take one of these steps up in material quality and thickness, you have a corresponding price and life span increase.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Alan<br>

IKEA cabinets with custom doors by Semihandmade in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/becky-kitchen-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Becky and Sarah&#8217;s kitchen</a>.</p>
<h3>Cost aside, pre-fabricated cabinets might work best for you if your renovation timeline is speedy or you feel overwhelmed by choice.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets have lengthier lead times. If you’re gearing up for a renovation in the next two months, you can get your hands on pre-fab cabinets in-store on a same-day basis, or delivered within two or three weeks. And, a perceived weakness of pre-fabricated cabinets is actually a real strength: for many homeowners, unlimited choice is not necessarily desirable. Many homeowners go with custom cabinets because they think they want options and then end up feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed. Pre-fabricated cabinets offer a pick-and-choose experience that requires less homework and decision fatigue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Many clients ask us what styles we offer and it can be hard to explain that it can be anything they imagine. Shops like ours provide personalized&nbsp;design as part of the overall service to build features for individual clients.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a></i></p>
<h3>Still having trouble deciding? Go for a&nbsp;hybrid!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Combining a pre-fab kitchen with custom pieces can lower your cost without compromising on quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Combining a pre-fab kitchen with custom pieces allows for lower cost and uniqueness. Companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.semihandmade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semihandmade</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://kokeena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kokeena</a>&nbsp;make door and drawer faces for stock cabinets so you’re not limited to IKEA’s palette. In addition, there are endless options for shelving, countertops, and cabinet pulls&nbsp;allowing for individuality while using inexpensive pre-fab cabinets.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Lauren and Adam</a></i></p>

For more modern kitchens, a matte-finish knob or pull is an easy way to customize cabinets. Repainting with a calming neutral or a bold jewel tone can refresh a kitchen without requiring demolition.</p> </div> </div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday <a href="https://sweeten.com/about">Jean</a>, Becky and I visited <a href="https://www.bklyndesigns.com/">Bklyn Designs</a>, the annual showcase at St. Ann&#8217;s Warehouse for local designers and craftspeople. There were upholsterers, woodworkers, carpet makers, and metalsmiths there, all showing off the beautiful things they produced in their Brooklyn studios.</p>
<p>Two rising furniture-makers with very different sensibilities made a big impression.</p>
<p><a href="https://colleenanderic.com/">Colleen and Eric</a> design lovely, playful home furnishings inspired by far-fetched ideas. Small brass rivets are recessed into the dark wood top of the &#8220;Northstar Table&#8221; like stars in the constellation. If you locate the northstar and press down on it, a secret side drawer slides open. It&#8217;s the perfect place to stash a diary, jewelry, or contraband.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1306/4609972374_d29e761b2b.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC NIGHTSTAR TABLE" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3580/4609972472_cb9653e2ff.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC NIGHTSTAR TABLE DETAIL" /></p>
<p>Colleen and Eric&#8217;s &#8220;Hold on Tight Bookshelf&#8221; takes unlikely inspiration from the image of books toppling sideways off an open shelf. This simple maple shelf is capped at one end and has a brightly-colored, sliding metal stop at the other. The toy-like mechanism is a pretty accent and also a lot of fun. Becky couldn&#8217;t stop playing with the display model and Jean and I finally had to drag her away.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1188/4609972250_b3539e1cfa.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC HOLDONTIGHT" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3538/4609972550_fcf110dd4a.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC HOLDONTIGHT DETAIL" /></p>
<p>Colleen and Eric also make accessories like tote bags and keychains. Their product lines are sure to expand further as they&#8217;re struck by new ideas. It &#8216;ll be fun to see what they&#8217;ve come up with at next year&#8217;s fair.</p>
<p>In contrast, the pieces from Kai-Wei Hsu&#8217;s shop <a href="https://www.kwhfurniture.com/">KWH Furniture</a> take inspiration from the elemental qualities of the woods that they&#8217;re made from. The furniture in the new &#8220;Vice&#8221; line doesn&#8217;t shout out for attention. Each piece has a clear, modern sensibility and yet is so restrained so that it wouldn&#8217;t feel out of a place in a traditional interior.</p>
<p>The elegant &#8220;Bar Cart&#8221; is made from white oak with a cerused finish. The first thing you&#8217;re drawn to is the fine grain and stain of the wood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3587/4609973164_ba67d01791.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART" /></p>
<p>Then, as you lean in closer, you understand the exquisite workmanship of the piece. The outer corners of the frame are held together with wood splices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1404/4609972720_04fb2bdf7e.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART DETAIL 01" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4019/4609973430_5fff0ce9ab.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART DETAIL 02" /></p>
<p>The similarly elegant &#8220;Vanity Table&#8221; is made from black walnut with an oil finish. Its proportions are perfectly balanced. The first think that strikes you is the sumptuous finish in the wood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1317/4609363631_a18322cabf.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY" /></p>
<p>Then when you move in closer, as you&#8217;re bound to do, you see how subtly and precisely the drawers are fitted.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1274/4609363865_1d49899a26.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY DETAIL 03" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3332/4609363461_74f96200a4.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY DETAIL 02" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how Kai-Wei&#8217;s designs evolve as he explores new materials and details. Whatever direction the pieces take, I&#8217;m certain they&#8217;ll all have the same immaculate craftsmanship.</p>
