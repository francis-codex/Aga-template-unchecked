<h3>Setting goals for a new home</h3>
<p>We bought this house with dreams of a live/work space that would reflect our style and offer plenty of room for our art collection. Steve is a painter, so having his studio at home was a life-long dream. We also wanted a place where our friends and large extended family could come together.</p>

<p>We are Steve DeFrank and Lewis Holman. Steve teaches at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. Lewis is self-employed as a tax accountant. We sold our loft condo in Williamsburg after living in it for nearly 15 years to <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/townhouse-renovation-guide-purchasing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchase a small townhouse</a> in the South Bronx.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>From a two-family to a single-family rowhouse</h3>
<p>The engineer&#8217;s report on our 1882 rowhouse in Mott Haven, the Bronx, looked good, but we still wanted a gut renovation. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structure has three stories</a> comprising roughly 1,500 square feet. The home had been divided into two apartments and had eight rooms on two of the floors. We wanted to renovate and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convert to a single-family home</a> to accommodate a live/work situation.</p>

<p>We listed our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and began our search for <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/bronx-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design-build services in the Bronx</a>. Sweeten’s introduction to our Bronx contractor and architect was a valuable service. As first-time renovators, our biggest question before starting was how much <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overhauling the home would cost</a>. the project were about cost. In addition to an in-home studio, we wanted to open up every floor of the building, giving us fewer walls and more windows. We understood that altering the building in this way would be an investment.</p>
<p>The plan we made with the architect was for the ground floor to be Steve’s studio and a water closet—a bathroom with the sink outside. The middle floor would be the living and dining rooms, plus <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a customized kitchen</a> and a half bath. On the top floor would be our bedroom and a home office/guest bedroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a remodeled full bath</a>, and a laundry closet.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned for a true gut renovation</a>—nothing was in good enough shape to retain. Our Sweeten contractors demolished down to the bricks and joists, all of which had to be replaced or sistered; this was necessary to allow removal of the central beam, which had to be done to open up the ground- and middle-floor spaces.</p>
<h3>Radiant heat and functional stairs</h3>
<p>Throughout the home, we aimed for low-maintenance, design-worthy materials to evoke an aesthetic of warm minimalism. We wanted expansive wall space for hanging artwork. The ground-level studio interior is an open workspace with recessed LED lighting, a lot of artist’s storage, and radiant-heat flooring—which we installed on all levels. To bring as much light as possible to the studio, we opened the rear wall with an 8’ x 9’ three-panel glass sliding door.</p>
<p>We decided to remove the original front stoop and relocate the house’s entrance to the ground floor, which created some challenges. Our architect Shannon envisioned—and our Sweeten contractor produced—a storage unit that divides the entry area from the studio space. We had hoped to save the original interior staircase and railing, but our Sweeten contractor showed us options that made more sense.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we closed the stairs from the ground floor to the first to create more wall space in the studio; we chose a vivid pink hue for the risers, which brightens the whole entrance. On the parlor and top floors, we went with a wood stair-rail that looks simultaneously classic and modern. In the end, we were very happy that we took our contractor’s advice.</p>

<h3>Connecting all of the floors</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vision for the kitchen</a> included custom millwork with the front panels painted green evoking the palest verdigris. Our island, which has an angled front, is an homage to artist Donald Judd. We rented nearby during renovations and observed this living area coming together. Visiting the site at least twice a week, we loved seeing the gradual progress, sometimes glacial and sometimes lightning quick.</p>

<p>A dining-area drawer and shelving system provides storage and connects these rooms to the top floor, where the main bedroom and home office also employ coordinating storage units. We had fun with tile to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modernize the full bath</a> upstairs, where we mixed matte and glossy tile in a range of sizes and colors, including chartreuse, dark green, and gray-green.</p>
<h3>A building exterior refresh</h3>
<p>The elimination of the parlor-floor entrance led to an anomaly on the front of the house, with regards to the living-room windows. The window occupying the old door frame is much larger than the window next to it. The architect’s solution—a modular window design, made up of a series of smaller frames, one of which mirrors the smaller window to create a visual connection.</p>

<h3>Steve and Lewis’ renovation advice</h3>
<p>Throughout the job, we enjoyed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaborative exchange with our contractor</a> and architect. As first-time (and last!) renovators, we’d embarked on possibly the most stressful project of our lives. Luckily, we had <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chosen the right team</a> carefully. Our contractor and crew kept a sense of humor during a long, arduous process.</p>
<p>Our advice to other <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowners ready for a renovation</a>: Anticipate bad news and delays, and roll with the punches. Be grateful for the opportunity you have, even when you wonder why you ever thought it was a good idea! And remember, issues that arise and seem monumental during the process get solved, and are forgotten once you move in. Now when we enter our home, we feel serene.</p>

			<h2 class="p1">From challenges and solutions to expanding square footage and tips on preparing for the process</h2>

<p class="p3">The character of Philadelphia is <a href="https://www.dwell.com/article/history-of-american-row-houses-8600298c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defined by its rowhouse streetscapes</a>. Rowhouses are space-efficient, compact, and often cost-effective. Remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse comes with its share of joys and challenges. Sweeten lays out what you can expect with renovating these historic buildings.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/pa/philadelphia-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">What is a rowhouse in Philadelphia?</h3>
<p class="p3">A Philadelphia rowhouse is an urban one-to-four-story house that has a narrow front exterior. Rowhouses are attached to similar rowhouses on both sides.</p>
<p class="p3">Philadelphia has more rowhouses than any other type of housing structure. Designed as an inexpensive way to house Philadelphia’s rapidly growing industrial population, rowhouses have become desired, premium properties.</p>
<p class="p3">Some Philly rowhouses are quite large. Rittenhouse Square mansions can be as huge as 3,000 to 6,000 square feet. Most Philadelphia rowhouses are small to moderate in size, though. Trinities and Bandboxes (smaller versions of Trinities) can be as tiny as 400 to 600 square feet. Two-story rowhouses in Center City, South and North Philadelphia, and Manayunk can range from 1,000 to 1,600 square feet.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse: Challenges and solutions</h3>
<p class="p3">Because Philly rowhouses are unique, renovating them can present challenges. But to an experienced contractor, solving these issues is just a part of the daily work of creativity and flexibility.</p>
<p class="p3">Philly-area-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6753#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor <span class="s1">John</span></a> calls his approach “bob and weave,” after a boxer’s split-second, nimble approach to punches that come their way. “Rowhouses don’t always need to be more difficult,” said John, “because we try to be flexible.”</p>
<p class="p3">John cites his approach to debris removal as an example. It’s no problem to park rolloff dumpsters in the driveway of a suburban single-family detached house; you just do it. But when a dumpster needs to be parked on a public street, all sorts of permitting issues arise.</p>
<p class="p3">John’s solution is to cycle out debris every day. “A hauling company picks up the daily load and some of my guys have trucks, too, so they can move debris.”</p>
<p class="p3">Narrow doorways are obstacles to moving in building materials and appliances. Sometimes the old 30-inch doorways have been widened already. When they haven’t, John calls this one of his biggest problems with rowhouse remodels. But he can always find workarounds by temporarily removing door trim or by unboxing appliances.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Ways to increase square footage in rowhouses</h3>
<p class="p3">Squeezed in on both sides, the average rowhouse is fairly small. So, remodels need to be creative. Some contractors build soffits (or bulkheads) over exposed pipes, wires, and vents. However, doing this reduces space. “We like to avoid building soffits,” say<span class="s1">s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6510#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Mario</a>, who is based in Philadelphia</span>, “and most homeowners don’t want soffits, either.”</p>
<p class="p3">So, Mario finds it worthwhile to reroute pipes and electrical through walls and ceilings. “It gives it a cleaner look and that’s what people want.” In some cases, Mario will push out a wall or ceiling a smidge. “If the ceiling is 10 feet or more, we might drop the ceiling just a little to run services through there.”</p>
<p class="p3">For homeowners who want more room, there is always more space to be had in the back or upward. “Pilot houses,” says Mario, referring to rooftop decks, “are one of the most popular ways to expand upward.” Plus, he sees some clients purchasing two adjacent rowhouse units and removing the wall between the two. This effectively doubles the rowhouse square footage.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Permitting and approvals for remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse</h3>
<p class="p3">With most substantial Philadelphia rowhouse remodels, you&#8217;ll need permits. Any alteration that costs $10,000 or more requires drawings of the proposed construction. These drawings must have the seal or stamp of a licensed architect or engineer.</p>
<p class="p3">Sweeten general contractors can refer an architect if the services of one are needed. Having an experienced architect and general contractor by your side will help you move through the permitting process more easily.</p>
<p class="p3">Not every Philly rowhouse is a historically designated structure. However, thousands of them are. If yours is one, you’ll need to seek authorization and go through a separate approval process with the Philadelphia Historic Commission.</p>
<p class="p3">Check the <a href="https://www.phila.gov/documents/philadelphia-register-of-historic-places" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Philadelphia Register of Historic Places</span></a> to see if your home is designated as historic.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><strong>4 tips for remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Be ready for costlier materials<br />
</b>Renovating a newer home means that you can use a wide range of materials. Many homeowners can find off-the-shelf materials at the local home center to use. But historic Philly rowhouses have masonry, molding, trim, ornamental metals, walls, and ceilings of a more specialized—and costly—nature. Prepare by padding your materials budget.</li>
<li><b>Be available<br />
</b>Remodeling a Philly rowhouse isn’t a “set it and forget it” project. Be available and responsive to everyone working on your project, including the architect, contractor, or project manager.</li>
<li><b>Predict the unpredictable<br />
</b>Prepare yourself and your budget for contract <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/how-do-i-document-change-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change orders</a> (changes that alter the original scope agreed and signed upon). Change orders help your remodel project adapt to unexpected discoveries along the way.</li>
<li><b>Rely on your experts<br />
</b>Unless your daily job is renovating rowhouses, the experts you’ve hired know more than you do. After all, they do this on a daily basis. You’re not just hiring a pair of hands; you’re taking advantage of years of experience and knowledge.</li>

<h3>Moving from co-op to a house</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After living in Brooklyn for nine years, I decided to move back to Queens in search of more space and a slice of the outdoors. I purchased a 1,300-square-foot attached brick rowhouse from the ‘40s. It had a small front patio where I could sit and drink my coffee on the weekends, plus a small front garden to plant vegetables and do some xeriscaping (landscaping that requires little or no irrigation).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, the purpose of the purchase and subsequent renovation was to create a sanctuary where I could relax after a long day of work. I wanted to make sure to bring in the things that I had loved about my Brooklyn brownstone co-op, while enjoying and making good use of my new space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always wanted to live in a Craftsman cottage but knew I couldn’t find this style of building in New York City. Instead, I decided I would incorporate cottage-style elements into my interior design choices. A few things would need to be changed immediately; there were lime green walls in the bedroom and a vibrant orange hallway. I also wanted to rip up the linoleum and carpet floors, replace the house’s original windows, and update the kitchen, bathroom, and entryway.</span></p>

<h3>Spicing up the entry</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">entryway </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was very important to me. Moving from an apartment to a house, I could now fully set the tone that welcomed everyone into my home. The entryway had been functional, but bland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="patterned-tiles-entryway" class="alignnone wp-image-50365 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1.jpg" alt="patterned tiles at entryway with two wooden doors after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-02-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-wallpaper-entryway-blue-door" class="alignnone wp-image-50406 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23.jpg" alt="white wallpaper in entryway with blue door and blue patterend floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SWEETEN-Monique-2021-Apt-23-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I added some touches that brought the outside in and made me smile whenever I opened the front door. I chose to custom design the steel front door in a Craftsman style that felt warm and inviting. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the flooring</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, white-and-blue handmade cement tiles added a lot of personality. I didn’t want the walls to pale in comparison to the bold floor, so I found a textured and paintable wallpaper that mimicked an abstracted cloud design.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I didn’t have enough space for a grand entrance, I still wanted to make a statement for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">front entry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by using a modern fixture and opening up the arch to double the size in the living room.</span></p>
<h3>Design elements to make it truly home</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized how important incorporating the outdoors into the space was for me. When I was a kid, we couldn’t really afford to renovate the wood-paneled walls that were in my bedroom. Instead, my mom gave my room a woodland theme and installed green carpet that was the color of grass and would encourage me to take off my socks so we could play barefoot in the “grass” together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-room-black-couch-wooden-floor" class="alignnone wp-image-50369 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1.jpg" alt="white room with black couch and white pendant light and wooden flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-06-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-living-room-blue-couch" class="alignnone wp-image-50372 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1.jpg" alt="white living room with blue and red couch and white floor rug on wooden floor and large window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was so excited when my Sweeten general contractor suggested I install European tilt-and-turn-style windows. You can open them all the way and really feel like you are inviting in the outdoors. We were able to remove the linoleum and carpet throughout the house and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stain the wood floors</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> underneath. I debated going with a modern, gray stain, but ultimately decided on a timeless walnut that felt more appropriate to the cottage style. I loved the original </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">built-in shelves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the living room, so I just asked for the design elements at the top to be cut off, which made the built-ins feel timeless versus dated.</span></p>

<h3>Form and function for a Cottage-style kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kitchen,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I decided to mix cooler colors and neutrals like blues, whites, and grays, balanced with a bit of warmth from some champagne bronze accents. I wanted a certain set of cabinet pulls that were too expensive for my budget, but was thrilled to find a similar version for a third of the price.</span></p>
<h3>Small kitchen details made the difference</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was these kinds of details that really started to matter to me throughout the process. I spent hours looking at doorknobs and faucets, which I hadn’t expected. I didn’t realize how much I would want a say in every design choice and how much I would care about all the little details that were going into my home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-open-kitchen-closed-cabinets" class="alignnone wp-image-50379 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-16-1.jpg" alt="white open kitchen with closed kitchen cabinets and golden handles and white backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-16-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-16-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-16-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I have room to eat in the kitchen. My contractor transformed a small broom closet in the hallway into a pull-out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pantry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It stores all of my dry goods and is so space-efficient. Without it, that closet would have held trash bags and a Swiffer, but now I use every inch of that space for my spices, peanut butter, and pancake mix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One small accent that was a big deal for me was the ceramic crackle push plates for the swinging doors between the kitchen and the bedroom. I’m a big fan of British television and had been inspired by the homes in shows I watch. It was hard to find this kind of push plate in the U.S., so I ended up having them imported from England. I was so nervous about them making it over in one piece, but they did, and I’m so glad I was able to incorporate them into my space. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of my decisions were functional, but everyone thought I was crazy when I installed wainscoting in my very tight </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">powder room</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I understand why—the wainscoting literally took away space—but I went for it anyway. As a trade-off, I saved space with a corner toilet and a size-appropriate sink. I am really happy with how it turned out.</span></p>
<h3>Remodeling with peace-of-mind</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t really need to take up Sweeten’s check-ins during the renovation. It was reassuring, though, to know they were there should issues come up, as this was my first major home renovation. It gave me peace of mind—like that optional purchase protection on a big product purchase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a first-time renovator, I wasn’t sure how long everything would take or how involved I would be in the process. I was glad that I was able to be involved in most of the decisions, even though I <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work full-time and couldn’t be physically</a> present all day. I don’t know how working people managed projects like this before email!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My renovated space feels like a peaceful retreat. I love how welcoming and warm it feels for my friends and their kids to come and hang out. My contractor understood my vision and now I’m able to relax and fully be myself in this new space.</span></p>

<h3>Keeping it together but separate</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The truth is we had a long list of desires when it came to buying our first home together. We wanted a house that was true to the time it was built, but clean and crisp and modernized. We bought it knowing that it needed a renovation, and as such lined up our contractor as we were finalizing the purchase. We wanted to start our renovation within a week of the closing and pay both mortgage and rent for no more than eight weeks. </span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44178 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20.jpg" alt="portrait, NYC, Brooklyn, construction, home renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because Stephen’s mother was moving in with us, and she is <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unable to manage stairs</a>, we needed a first-floor space for her. The house was a two-family home, with an upstairs apartment that was separate from the garden-level duplex. We decided to create a single-family house using the parlor level as entertaining space, allowing us to live separately, but together.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have a background in interior design and Stephen has renovation experience, but this was for both of us our first construction project in New York City. Our vision was of a house that would feel contiguous </span><span class="s1">but not too chopped up and not sterile. To that end, we drew lines with a well-curated mix of surfaces, and the outcome is fantastic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8.jpg" alt="townhouse living room" width="1000" height="670" class="alignnone wp-image-44177 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8-600x402.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Real hardwood floors</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house most needed a revamp on the garden and top floors along with proper bedrooms and a full-house fire/CO2 monitoring system. </span><span class="s2">Our plan was to tear out the existing fake-wood flooring on both levels and replace it with hardwood, and</span><span class="s1"> save the original floors on the parlor level</span><span class="s2">. </span><span class="s1">We chose a dark-wood flooring with a hand-scraped finish that was not ridiculously expensive. We needed it to hold up to kids, dogs, a walker, and it really has. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1">On the garden level where my mother-in-law has her own ap</span></span><span class="s1"><span class="s1">artment, the foyer was updated with full marble slabs on the walls and floor. In the back,</span>the laundry room got a better egress to the backyard. Additionally, it functions as a mudroom with custom cabinetry and a pull-down drying rack where we can hang wet clothes. The bathroom received a simple replacement of fixtures and a coat of paint which changed it completely</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1">Storage in the kitchen</h3>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s amazing how much the wrap-around pantry holds.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="663" class="alignnone wp-image-44166 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13-300x199.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13-600x398.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15.jpg" alt="kitchen seating area" width="1000" height="671" class="alignnone wp-image-44168 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15-600x403.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The existing kitchen was L-shaped with very little counter space and a mobile dishwasher. As</span><span class="s1"> a big cooking family, we are very heavy users of the kitchen. By shifting the main k</span>itchen to one wall—including a dishwasher, wall oven, and a larger sink—it provided space for an island, a wrap-around pantry, and dining table.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44170 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-11a.gif" alt="pantry, kitchen pantry, wraparound pantry, kitchen, multigenerational kitchen, construction, home renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how much the wrap-around pantry holds. Since it&#8217;s the other main kitchen wall, we could only fit 12&#8243;-15&#8243; deep cabinets. Instead of upper and lowers, we installed full-height 15&#8243; upper cabinets and are able to store an enormous amount of pantry and serving items. <span class="s1">The cabinet finishes are white and acacia and topped with a highly durable quartz surface including a big, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">walk-around island</a>.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10.jpg" alt="stairs" width="1000" height="1497" class="alignnone wp-image-44165 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10-600x898.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1">Heading up to the parlor floor, we removed the stair runner and painted the stair treads, risers, balusters, and spindles in one color. We used the black paint in a flat finish on the stair boards, and a pearl finish on the railings for extra luster.</span></p>

<h3>Specific bathroom features</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom gut reno on the top floor focused on creating a stand-up shower. Stephen and I travel a lot for work and have huge pet peeves. We wanted to turn on the water without getting wet and have a shelf or bench to put a foot upon or sit on. We chose a glass surround with a frameless structure to make the room feel as open as possible. The custom vanity is made of walnut, with four drawers that maximize countertop and storage space. It all fits nicely in a tiny-but-functional 5’ x 8’ bathroom space.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<div><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-3.jpg" alt="walk in shower" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-44179 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></div>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-5.jpg" alt="bathroom open shelving" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-44181 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-5-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-5-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span class="s1">We ended up skim coating almost the entire house, and our Sweeten contractor worked miracles on the original plaster that was uneven and had an unappealing, thick texture. <span class="s1" style="color: #333333;">It gave us a lot more understanding of how hard it really is to properly repair plaster so that it looks like new!</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4.jpg" alt="shower seat" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-44180 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most difficult part of the renovation was the last six weeks, when we were living in the house, still under construction, with a three-year-old. Living in a space being renovated is challenging and exhausting, but our contractor staged the work so we could move in, and the crew became like family! It’s doable if you have fully functioning bathrooms and kitchen. Sweeten assisted throughout, from matching us with a contractor to providing a full bid review, and checking in about issues or concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the end, we increased the scope of what we wanted to do significantly and our costs grew—but we got it all done in the</span><span class="s1"> range of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 to $150 per square foot</a>. Doing it simultaneously means that now we can enjoy our home and our time together as a multigenerational family. </span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Nadia and Stephen, for sharing your new home with us!</em></p>

<li><strong>Homeowner&#8217;s quote:</strong> &#8220;You never felt like you were just being fit into their day. We felt like priority clients,” said Tracey. And Sweeten “was great.

</ul>
<p><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowners Tracey and Stephen </i></span></p>
<h3>The existing kitchen made it impossible to entertain</h3>
<p>For years, Tracey Dixon and Stephen Neverson and their three young children were always renters in New York City. But in a confluence of difficult and emotional events—the deaths of Tracey’s parents (just three weeks apart after 42 years of marriage), which led to some inheritance money, followed closely by the sale of their apartment by their landlord—pushed them to decide to purchase a place of their own.</p>
<div></div>

<p>While the ‘40s attached rowhouse in Brooklyn’s East Flatbush had enough space (1,930 square feet), it also had a kitchen with a drop ceiling, wood paneling, an unsightly ceramic floor, and a sink that was falling apart. “We entertain a lot, and the kitchen blocked us from that. The stove was crooked because of the floor, and there was a thick layer of grease on everything that would not come off. The pipes were old as I don’t know what,” says Tracey, a freelance violist who runs the private Dixon String Studio and avid cook with a culinary degree. “I wanted a <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/the-411-on-kitchen-cabinet-door-designs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern, bright, clean design</a>.”</p>
<p>Tracey and Stephen, a high school guidance counselor,<span> </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a><span> </span>to<span> </span>Sweeten, and planned a renovation<span> </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with their chosen contractor</a>.</p>
<h3><b>A chef-ready kitchen with everything a family needs</b></h3>
<p>While Tracey wanted her<span> </span>chef’s kitchen, she didn’t want it to feel sterile. “This is a home, not a restaurant,” she said. “And the kitchen is the center of our home.” The design combines her love for both modern and Japanese aesthetics.<span class="s10_overlay-text"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/16433-Tracey-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="Galley kitchen with white countertops and backsplash" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/16433-Tracey-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/16433-Tracey-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/16433-Tracey-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The dishwasher and stove were the two things Tracey was looking forward to the most. “We are a family of five and a dishwasher is crucial,” she said. The stove is “beloved. It allows me to create. I needed more power out of my stove. In our last apartment, it took me 100 years just to boil water for pasta,” she said.</p>
<p>During the renovation, Tracey said she became a “microwave cooking queen.” It was difficult to navigate the renovation with three small children and all their appliances sitting in the living room. But they couldn’t eat out all the time. “I discovered I could make lovely broccoli and fabulous rice in the microwave!” Tracey said.</p>
<p><span class="s10_overlay-text"></span><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tracey_spice_rack.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-54033 size-full" /></p>
<p>Once they put everything back into the new kitchen, they were glad they had pull-out drawers for the recycling, spices, and oils. “There is so much storage. We also have two open-shelving spaces, which I just love,” she said.</p>
<h3>Learning lessons during the Brooklyn remodel</h3>
<p>If they ever renovate again, she’d know to “save for the renovation and the padding around it. The incidental costs caught us off guard. We factored in some, but not all. We were still able to get everything done, but we definitely could have benefitted from more financial padding.”</p>

<h3>Planning the next remodel</h3>
<p>The couple loved working with their Sweeten contractor and designer on the remodel of their Brooklyn kitchen. “They were the absolute greatest,” Tracey said. “The level of professionalism was top notch. They did everything they could on this project. The kitchen was completely gutted and done in five weeks. They worked hard and were consistent. You never felt like you were just being fit into their day. We felt like priority clients.” And Sweeten “was great. They checked in regularly to see how things were going and made sure we knew they were available for any and all help.”</p>

<p>Now that it’s all over, Tracey is looking toward their next possible project. “The outdoor deck is definitely in our future renovation plans for our lifestyle.” She is daydreaming about a deck with Portuguese tiles, maybe a partial patio, and a grassy area. “Nature is important, necessary, and dear to me,” she said. “My family and guests need to have an option of green in our urban landscape.”</p>
<p><span><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Tracey expresses her love and nurturing through food. “Just a few weeks ago, the added counter space allowed me to show my brother some cooking tips because he has a new love for cooking. Food binds our cultures and our lives together,” she explained.</p>
