<p>Often on the wish-list, islands are the perfect kitchen workhorse but don&#8217;t need to look so hard-working. The waterfall style gives this piece of furniture a finishing touch. From wood to concrete, here are seven ideas to pore over.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><em>When Amanda and her husband set out to upgrade from their two-bedroom Windsor Terrace apartment in Brooklyn, they had a few adjectives in mind—light, airy, warm. They loved the neighborhood as well as the great light in their rental, but as work-from-home writers, desired larger bedrooms and a more spacious kitchen. They had also just gotten married, and if you’ve ever had a registry, you understand why they needed more kitchen storage! Here’s the story of how a visit with friends led them to a new home, and how an irresistible pattern sparked their kitchen design.</em></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22363 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-723x565.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="565" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-723x565.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-300x235.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-600x469.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Amanda’s initial intention was to stay in Windsor Terrace, the direction of her apartment search changed when she and her husband visited some friends at their new home in the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a> (CHC). They loved the feel of the complex and the apartment space itself, and realized that this was where they wanted to be. After a few months of checking out CHC listings as they came on the market, the couple landed a two-bedroom, one-bath apartment. Coincidentally, it was the mirror image of the one their friends owned!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As writers who both work from home, Amanda and her husband appreciated that the two bedrooms were equally sized; one could be used as a roomy home office as well as guest quarters for out-of-town visitors.  At around 1,000 square feet, the unit also had southern exposures that provided the lovely, warm light they had been in search of. The only issue was the kitchen: it was dark and closed off, and connected to a strange pass-through pantry that housed a bar counter. Although it had been recently renovated, the craftsmanship was poor, as there were already cracks and scratches in the cabinetry and flooring. At first sight, Amanda thought it would be a deal-breaker. She was eager for a simple move, and very hesitant to embark on a renovation of any kind. But slowly, she and her husband talked themselves into it—after all, the apartment was ideal in every other way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22336 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-Before-02" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So as they began the process of closing on the apartment, Amanda <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their kitchen renovation</a> to Sweeten. As a first-time renovator, she wasn’t sure how to decide between the various bids. Our in-house team came to the rescue: a call with one of Sweeten’s project advisors proved to be useful. The chat gave Amanda the chance to think out loud and consider the pros and cons of each bid, and she selected her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/338020 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22338 mb-24 mt-24 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-01" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22340 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amanda’s vision for the kitchen reflected the feeling she wanted for the apartment as a whole: clean and bright, but not too modern or sterile. “We both love to cook and wanted to feel comfortable there, like we could make a mess,” Amanda explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They began by knocking down the walls that separated the kitchen and pantry from the living room and dining nook. (This is a common theme in the CHC kitchens! For more inspiration, check out Laura and Matthew’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a>, as well as Mario and Joe’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>.) One of the doorways from the kitchen to the hallway was closed off to extend the kitchen space across the entire wall. In a brilliant move, their Sweeten contractor turned the unused space next to the refrigerator into diagonal built-in shelving, now the perfect spot to display photos and items from their travels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the space was opened up, the couple turned their attention to the details. Early on, Amanda fell in love with a Mediterranean-inspired patterned tile in black, grey and white, and built the entire kitchen design to complement it. Although she had originally considered the tile as a backsplash, it made more sense as flooring—a wise suggestion from her mom. For the millwork, their Sweeten contractor sourced custom cabinetry with simple lines in a white shaker style. A single set of glass doors was installed to break the solid run of uppers. A rich walnut countertop was chosen for an added layer of drama—they had first considered using a lighter wood, but the darker wood coordinated better with the floors, a decision supported by their contractor. Although <span style="color: #000000;">the work surface requires</span> some upkeep, Amanda reports that she “adores them!” Brass knobs and pulls for the cabinets were next, along with a vintage-inspired metal light fixture for the ceiling. While they kept their fairly new appliances from the apartment’s previous renovation, they added a wine fridge next to the dishwasher.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22342 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22341 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-05-06.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-05-06" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, Amanda worked with her Sweeten contractor to resolve issues as they arose. In one incident, the cabinetmaker realized that the measurements had been off, and that a cabinet would have been essentially unusable because of an immovable obstruction. He worked with the contractor to revise the layout overnight, and went into production with very little delay. Aside from this challenge, things went mostly according to plan, not to mention the shortest wait time for board approval that we’ve ever heard—about two weeks! (Could it be because Sweeten has done dozens of renovations in her building?)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that they’re done, Amanda has words of wisdom for aspiring renovators: “Don’t rush the process. We were impatient and moved all our things in right after the demolition stage. This meant that all of our belongings went into one bedroom, stacked and wrapped in plastic. We went to stay with our in-laws for the duration of the project. Our contractor was very understanding and worked quickly, but didn’t cut corners and finished on schedule—it took about a month in the end. Although this didn’t happen with us, a hurried contractor might be tempted to be less detailed-oriented. Trust the contractor! He knows what he’s doing and how long it’ll take to do it.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22343 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-08-1-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-08" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22339 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-02" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a book lover, Amanda’s one regret is that they didn’t think to carve out space in the wall shared between the kitchen and the hallway for built-in bookshelves. Still, as a first-time renovator, we think she did an amazing job, and like other Sweeten clients, she can always return for another renovation someday!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thank you, Amanda, for sharing this lovely space. We hope that you and your husband enjoy cooking up your next literary masterpieces.</em></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20235 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><br />
<i><span class="img-label"> Guest post by Nikki, Astoria homeowner</span></i><span id="more-19099"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we first entered the New York City real estate market, my husband and I had three goals in mind. The first was to stay in our beloved neighborhood, Astoria, the second was to have more space than our rental, and the third was to have an open kitchen. Of course, all of this coupled with the most important goal–to stay under budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A wise friend told us to be prepared to have our hearts broken. After months of searching and touring the limited number of apartments available in Astoria, we came across The One. It was beautifully modern, with all of the bells and whistles that I yearned for as an avid baker and home entertainer. A few weeks into negotiations, the deal fell apart. I was heartbroken, and we were back on the market. Two days later, we put an offer in on our current home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I knew when we first saw the apartment that it would need a makeover. While the kitchen and bathroom were perfectly adequate (as it had only been constructed four years ago), it just wasn’t our style, and there were minor details that indicated sloppy work and cut-corners. We had a limited budget and wanted to renovate both the kitchen and the bathroom &#8212; two expensive spaces. We wanted to convert the tub to a walk-in shower to maximize space in the bathroom and we also wanted to improve functionality in the kitchen to optimize space and utilize every square inch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19084 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_nikki_kitchen_bathroom-before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19083" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="sweeten_nikki_kitchen_bathroom-before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I spent hours and hours on Pinterest, secretly plotting the perfect kitchen and bathroom. My colleague told me about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> one day when I mentioned I was looking for a general contractor. (She’s now going through her own Sweeten renovation in Brooklyn!) I was instantly hooked on the Sweeten blog, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/13712" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted my project</a> the day our closing date was announced. When we were introduced to our Sweeten contractor, I didn’t know what to expect, but meeting her was not what I had in mind for meeting a general contractor. It was more like meeting an old friend. She was warm, open-minded, knowledgeable, and she instantly put me at ease. We discussed my very detailed vision (from weeks of Pinning!) and she seemed to “get” me immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The style I envisioned was a mix between classic glam, modern, and vintage touches that were a nod to pre-war NYC apartments of the 1920s and 30s. In the kitchen, we initially discussed ways in which we could preserve the cabinets to save on budget; however, we soon realized that this was a kitchen that would be called to greatness. my contractor brought in a millworker who built beautiful custom cabinetry, and we walked through every corner of that kitchen, discussing every cabinet, every door, every square inch of space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided on a configuration that would truly maximize the kitchen for a cook – moving the island a few inches to accommodate both a pull-out spice rack and utensil rack on either side of the stove, adding a pull-out trash and recycle bin underneath a 30” apron front sink, removing the overhead microwave for a full size hood, relocating the microwave to the island while adding six drawers: four tiny ones for utensils and two large ones for pots and pans, a kick toe drawer for the little things like kitchen towels, large pull-out drawers that opened from the front of the island for my collection of baking tools and sprinkles, and dividers for all of my baking sheets in the cabinet above the refrigerator. The meeting was energizing and Charles’ passion really came through&#8211;waving his arms in the most animated fashion, talking about wood types and inlay cabinet doors.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To finish the kitchen, we chose a beautiful, slate-like porcelain tile flooring, dramatic brushed brass hardware from Martell Hardware, a show-stopping champagne gold faucet from Delta, a two-toned paint treatment with warm white for the upper cabinets and an unexpected jewel blue for the lowers, a traditional subway tile backsplash with dark grout, and finally, a gorgeous white quartz countertop that mimicked the veining of Carrara marble without the porousness. (Thanks to the contractor and my husband, Chris, for talking me out of sparkly, recycled glass quartz with specks of glitter.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Chris took the initiative to find vintage inspired hardware to match our vision of a modernized, New York City pre-war bathroom. We took inspiration from all of our favorite restaurant bathrooms in Astoria and Manhattan. For the flooring, we chose lovely matte black hexagon tile which the crew installed beautifully despite it being a difficult tile to lay perfectly. To maximize visibility, we chose to install a panel of glass instead of a shower with a door. We selected a traditional style rain showerhead and a handshower with a porcelain handle. For the vanity, we went with a modern, gray floating vanity with a Carrera marble top and faucet hardware with white porcelain handles. The walls received a gorgeous treatment of white subway tile with gray grout and an unexpected yet bold touch – black wallpaper featuring golden pineapples from Rifle Paper Co.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Home renovations can be extremely stressful, especially when you choose to live through the renovation. Through this experience, we have showered at our friends’ homes, brushed our teeth at local coffee shops, and ordered from Seamless four times a week. The amount of dust and debris seemed inexhaustible. Yet to see the daily progress, to see our vision come to life, made it all worthwhile. The contractor&#8217;s team made us feel comfortable and we saw them so often they became almost like family. In fact, our pug started to wait at the door every morning for the team to arrive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our renovation taught us many things. We learned about trusting others to work in our home and take care of it. We learned about our own preferences, managing budget and timeline, and how to compromise. We learned about community, our wonderful neighborhood that opened its arms to us when we didn’t have basics like running water for a few days. We learned the names of baristas and bartenders, the cost of raw materials and the process of how a house becomes a home. Our condo is a perfect square; it’s our little 580 square foot shoebox. For my husband and I and our 9-year-old pug, it’s cozy, functional, luxurious, and most importantly, home.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Editor&#8217;s Note: This post, originally published May 2014, is one of our favorites for still having a classic and modern look years later. Allison and Jovito purchased their first home together—a single-family brick row house, c. 1910, in the Ocean Parkway neighborhood of Brooklyn. Though they knew the place needed some serious renovations, Allison, a content manager, and Jovito, an electronic prepress director, both in textbook publishing, promptly packed up and, along with their adorable cat, Momo, moved in and geared up for some major home improvements. Allison shares their renovation story and walks us through the stylish choices she and Jovito made in the process of creating their new home.</i><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/"><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ten months of intense searching, eight lost bids and a couple hundred viewed properties later, Jovito and I finally found an adorable 1910 brick row house in the Ocean Parkway neighborhood of Brooklyn to call our own. We loved the bones and original details of the house, but the over 100-year-old home was also in need of some serious updating. Knowing that we’d have some large-scale renovations ahead of us, we went into the purchase two parts excited and one part slightly terrified.  There was a long list of items on our “fix” list when we moved in, but we also had a limited budget. So our energy and efforts were focused on tackling the kitchen and upstairs bathroom renovation first.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having never renovated a property before, we didn’t know where to start. How would we <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find a reputable contractor</a> that would understand our vision, work within our budget, and do a stellar job? Perusing Apartment Therapy on a day when I was feeling somewhat overwhelmed by all our options, I read about Sweeten and decided to post <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our project</a> to the site. We really liked the idea that they would act as matchmakers and pair us with contractors based on our project’s scope of work and budget. Knowing that they had pre-screened their network of contractors also made choosing feel a lot less scary.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After meeting with two contractor matches from Sweeten, and two contractors that were friend referrals, we decided to award our renovation job to Sweeten. We appreciated his pragmatism, patience in answering our many questions, and his thoroughness during the onsite visit. We also appreciated that he seemed completely un-phased by the scary (to us), timeworn, “before” conditions of the kitchen and bathroom. He’d seen and worked on old houses like this many times, so that also helped us feel like we were in good hands. His familiarity with constructing IKEA kitchens and reasonable estimate sealed the deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We started our renovation of the kitchen and bathroom in mid-November. Living in the house during construction wasn’t fun, but our contractor and his team were careful to keep the work area as clean and contained as possible. On the plus side, it was exciting for us to see the team’s daily progress and some of the relics they unearthed during demolition. (Like pieces of newspaper from 1943 mentioning President Roosevelt stuck inside the bathroom walls!) The team spent a lot of time and effort making sure the new walls and floors were level, plumb, and true, which was no small feat in an old house where nothing is straight!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen needed a gut renovation. The walls were covered with dark wood paneling and cabinets, there was a dropped ceiling with fluorescent lighting, cracked floor tile and beat up Formica countertops and backsplash. The existing soffit ran in front of the kitchen window, cutting a good eight inches off the top, and a lot of daylight along with it. It was a less-than-optimal layout and had definitely seen better days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of our limited <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a>, we decided to go with IKEA kitchen cabinetry and Caesarstone quartz countertops, both of which we purchased during one of IKEA’s kitchen sales. Not wanting the new kitchen to clash with the age of the house but also wanting it to feel current and new, we went with a more traditional cabinet door style in a medium gray color. To keep the space open and airy feeling, we decided to forego wall cabinets. We made sure we had plenty of base <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinet storage</a> to hold all our pots and pans. Because we removed the dropped ceiling, we gained back some ceiling height, so we stacked glass-front cabinets to the ceiling and created a hutch to display our collection of vintage glassware and serveware. We chose durable white quartz countertops to keep the room bright and to add contrast to the gray cabinets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24048 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-723x525.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="525" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24049 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-06-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re tough on our <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>, so we chose extra durable wood-look porcelain tile that we found online at a closeout price. Our contractor laid the tile in a herringbone pattern. We really love the way it turned out! For the backsplash tile, we went with a large format porcelain tile with a raised geometric pattern and tiled all the way up the wall for visual impact. (It’s also incredibly <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ways-care-renovated-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">easy to clean</a>!) The wall tile is from Mondial in Bensonhurst.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We both love to cook so it was important for us to have a range that could accommodate many pots and pans and put out some serious BTUs. We were incredibly lucky to find our range second-hand in excellent condition at a local salvage shop. The exhaust hood was found in the clearance section of Home Depot and our brand new dishwasher came from the As-Is section of IKEA. Our counter-depth fridge was on sale at the local P.C. Richard &amp; Son.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our ceiling light fixtures are porcelain lamp holders made by Leviton running about $2/piece online. The pendant over the sink is from Restoration Hardware and is based off an Italian factory light from the 1950s. We like that the lights can extend out about four feet on each side, giving us the option of creating more overhead <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a> for prep if we need it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to go with brass cabinet pulls, knobs, and faucet to warm up all the cool gray and stainless steel. It took a lot of searching to find a brushed brass faucet, but we finally found one through Newport Brass. The solid brass pulls and knobs are made by Laurey and were also found online.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our bathroom was very…blue. Blue tub, blue toilet, blue tile. It had last been majorly renovated in the 50s and everything was really showing its age. The floor of the bathroom was about a 4” step up from the hallway—the ghosts of past flooring renovations buried beneath. To top it all off, the bathroom space itself was tiny—about 36 square feet. Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a> wouldn’t allow us to enlarge the space or reroute plumbing, so our goal was to increase the feeling of space while making it as pretty and useable as possible. Style-wise, we wanted the bathroom to look like it could have been original to the house so we were careful to choose pieces that had an old-fashioned feel to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To maximize space, we swapped the existing door for a pocket door and chose a dual-flush toilet with a narrow tank and small footprint. A console sink and clawfoot tub kept things airy and off the floor. Finding reasonably-priced marble floor and subway wall tile at Lowe&#8217;s kept us on budget, as well as sourcing salvage and secondhand materials which helped to cut costs. Finally, we added an exhaust fan/light combo to help cut humidity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24056 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24057 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-08-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite holidays, lots of snow days and a few surprises along the way, the renovation process was mostly stress-free. Our contractor did a good job keeping us informed throughout construction, and he always made himself available to answer questions. And because we lived in our house during construction, we were also able to address and correct any miscommunications right away, which helped the project run more smoothly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re thankful to the Sweeten team for pairing us up with the contractor and his team for an excellent first renovation experience! I&#8217;ve already recommended Sweeten to several friends! Sweeten&#8217;s matching service removes a lot of the scariness and uncertainty associated with finding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qualified contractor</a>. And when we’re finally ready to begin the next project, you can be sure we’ll be contacting them for another great match!</p>
