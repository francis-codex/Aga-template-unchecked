<p>When shopping for cabinets, your lifestyle, plus the materials available, will guide and influence the appearance of your cabinet doors. Do you like the traditional Shaker-style door with its raised frame and crisp edges? Or a sleek flat-front contemporary panel? Are your kids opening and closing doors all day with sticky fingers? Or is your kitchen the entertaining hub of your home, one that you like to keep looking neat for visiting friends and family?</p>
<p>Just about any style of door panel you choose will offer a range of finishes, many of them protective. Here,<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, lays out how to choose the right kitchen cabinets.</p>
<h3>How to choose your cabinet door style</h3>
<p>Most commonly, the door is a flat panel, a raised panel, or a slab front. What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>A raised panel</strong> has a raised rectangular-shaped center and the surface surrounding it is recessed, creating a frame-like appearance. The raised center may be surrounded by other detailing, such as a beveled edge, and/or an arched top, providing a traditional appearance, like antique cabinetry. This style looks beautiful with painted or stained finishes that play up the three-dimensional qualities.</p>

<p><strong>A flat panel</strong> is three-dimensional as well, but the center panel is recessed (though still flat) and framed by two stiles (rectilinear panels at either side) and two rails (panels at top and bottom). This construction is not simply decorative. It was developed (hundreds of years ago!) to keep the door shape stable with fluctuating temperatures and moisture. Popular examples are Shaker and Craftsman style. You can also find some additional variation, with a glass insert that replaces some or all of the center panel (much like a true divided light window), or a beadboard center panel for a country or cottage effect.</p>

<p><strong>A slab front</strong> is made from a single piece of material—solid hardwood, MDF, or a wood veneer. Because it is one surface with no corners or recesses to capture grime, it is easy to keep clean with the swipe of a cloth.</p>

<h3>Cabinet door materials</h3>
<p>Are you warm to wood or is a sparkling white kitchen more your craving? You can find a vast variety of looks in budget, high-end, and luxury cabinets. The rarer the material—think, solid wood—the greater the price tag. Here’s a quick guide to materials from lowest to highest price:</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30487 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above) </em>Custom cabinets with a walnut and mahogany veneer and inset doors in</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-studio-co-op-renovated-for-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Kim and Ian’s kitchen</a></p>
<p><strong>MDF or medium density fiberboard</strong> is manufactured under high pressure and temperatures by combining wood fibers with a resin binder to create door panels as well as the cabinet box. Because this type of material can be manufactured efficiently from wood byproducts, it’s typically the material for stock cabinets. It takes well to paint. Manufacturers will offer different glaze options to apply on top of the paint, so you can still achieve a custom look for a stock price.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36580 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />

<ul>
<li>Thermafoil is a scratch-resistant surface that is thermally glued and vacuum-sealed to MDF. It’s an option in the stock category and great for a lifestyle where the kitchen sees a tremendous amount of activity since it’s easy to maintain. Color choice is limited to white or linen.</li>
<li>Laminate is common in countertops. With laminate cabinets, it’s still a resin-saturated printed paper (commonly a high-res photographic representation of wood) fused to a particleboard or MDF core to create the panel. This offering is available in the stock category.</li>
<li>Veneer cabinets have real wood door panels for less than the price of solid wood. The wood surface here is less than a quarter of an inch and wrapped around an MDF panel for stability—good for areas with high humidity. The risk here is that if the wood is chipped or dinged, you will see the synthetic core, and it can’t be satisfactorily repaired; however, if your cabinets don’t see a lot of hard use, this is a well-priced option in the stock category.</li>
<li>Solid wood is the high-end or luxury category for cabinet doors. Each panel is unique, like the tree it was milled from. The big decision here is what species of wood. The most common are oak, maple, hickory, and cherry. All are hardwoods with a natural beauty and all take stain or paint well. Woods that are prized for their natural color and grain, particularly hickory and cherry, shouldn’t be painted.</li>
<li>Maple is a very hard wood, with a finer grain than oak, so it’s a good choice if you want a perfectly smooth finish for paint and/or glaze. With a clear finish, it takes a contemporary look, and with a deeper stain, it becomes more traditional.</li>
<li>Birch and ash are also durable hardwoods good for kitchen cabinets with more pronounced grains. You may remember pine from your grandma’s days. You can still find this classic, and its knotty grain has a rustic appeal, but as one of the softest woods, it will dent more readily than other species.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation of door styles</h3>
<p>The style of your kitchen cabinetry doesn’t stop with the door design. How the door lays on the box also affects the overall appearance; it’s another decision you will have to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full overlay: Doors (and drawers) cover the front of the cabinet box; hinges are hidden.</li>
<li>Partial overlay: Doors cover just a portion of the face frame; hinges remain concealed.</li>
<li>Inset: Doors are flush with the face frame of the cabinet box; hinges may be concealed or exposed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are the types of kitchen cabinets?</h3>
<p>Your selection process will begin with the door material, as it takes the brunt of the action, swinging open and shut all day, every day. Cabinet doors attach as a cover to the storage compartment they serve to conceal—typically, a box made of wood, plywood, or a wood composite. Construction offered by manufacturers, along with price, is defined by three categories:</p>
<h4>Stock cabinets</h4>
<ul>
<li>$60/ linear foot</li>
<li>Door material: MDF (covered in thermafoil, veneer, or laminate)</li>
<li>Box material: MDF</li>
</ul>
<p>Doors and their boxes come in a limited range of standard sizes. Boxes and doors tend to be made of MDF (medium density fiberboard, which is a composite of sawdust or wood fibers with resin to bind it) and covered in thermafoil, veneer, or laminate. Available from large retailers like Home Depot or Ikea, these cabinets can be good quality but are also the thriftiest choice. Prices vary across the country, starting at about $60 per linear foot and rising to a few hundred dollars, depending on any features you add. Most major manufacturers have a stock line. You may think that there are no options for customization in this category but some brands do offer upgrades such as glass doors or a selection of molding.</p>
<h4>Semi-custom cabinets</h4>
<ul>
<li>$90/ linear foot and up</li>
<li>Door material: solid wood</li>
<li>Box material: MDF or plywood</li>
</ul>
<p>A greater range of sizes and styles according to the manufacturer’s offering. Boxes may be constructed of MDF or plywood. Solid wood doors should be part of the selection, along with MDF and veneers. Expect to pay $90 per linear foot and upward, depending on what organization features or finishes you add on. Find this category at some home centers as well as independent kitchen showrooms that carry national brands offering both semi-custom and custom, such as Wellborn or KraftMaid.</p>
<h4>Custom cabinets</h4>
<ul>
<li>$200 &#8211; $500/ linear foot</li>
<li>Door material: solid wood</li>
<li>Box material: higher quality plywood</li>
</ul>
<p>Built to order to exact size specifications. Boxes tend to be higher-quality plywood and doors are solid wood in a range of species. You may be able to find custom cabinets for under $200 per linear foot, but since everything is made to order to your exact dimensions (and will take longer to arrive at your doorstep, as much as three months, compared to five to six weeks for stock or semi-custom), the price rises considerably. You may pay as much $500 per linear foot and into the thousands for special woods and exterior details. Custom cabinetry is also available from national retailers, such as<a href="https://www.poggenpohl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Poggenpohl</a>,<a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Bilotta</a>, and<a href="https://henrybuilt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Henrybuilt</a>.</p>
<p>As you survey the landscape of kitchen door panels for your cabinets, be sure to ask for samples. You may even be able to borrow a door panel from a local showroom. As with any investment for your home, you will want to try it out before you commit. Hopefully, this Sweeten guide helps you choose the perfect cabinets best suited for your needs and style.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20751 size-chrono" title="Kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg" alt="Kitchen cabinets" width="723" height="487" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></span>Laura and Matthew&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank">kitchen renovation</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cabinets typically represent a hefty chunk of your kitchen budget—hovering around 30%—so you want to choose carefully. The design you select not only sets the overall style of the room, but also helps to maintain its organization and order. So, how to get all the puzzle pieces—including pull-out shelves and kitchen islands—to fit scoring you the most storage and, hence, efficiency? Consider these factors:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Configurations that magnify storage</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Base cabinets may vary by width and height, but you are still limited by how tall you want your countertop to be. Wall cabinets can go all the way to the ceiling, utilizing even the topmost inches for infrequently used bulk items like paper towels. Combine and arrange the units according to how you operate in your kitchen and what tools or features you use most often. Deep drawers for pots and pans should go near the stove. Shallower drawers for utensils belong with the prep area, along with maybe a pullout cabinet for trash or recycling, and dishes and glassware near the dishwasher—all to minimize steps. Islands are a great place to stow cookware; be sure to allow for clearance of doors and drawers that must be pulled out. You might want to put open shelves on the ends to make way for drawer space in the middle and to avoid doors that can jut out into traffic paths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The advantage of stock versus semi-custom</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stock cabinets either come pre-made or require assembly. You can expect a good but limited range of sizes. Semi-custom units offer more choice of dimensions to provide a more exacting fit on your wall space. Semi-custom units typically change in 1-inch increments versus stock’s 3 inches, so there’s less risk of wasted space in a run of cabinets along a wall if you are willing to spend more. Of course, custom cabinets let you get the exact widths you want but expect to wait as much as 10 weeks for shipment versus five to six for semi-custom, and a week or longer for stock. You’ll also pay a heftier price for your one-of-a-kind choices. Read more on pre-fabricated and custom cabinets and how they compare to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank">stock items</a>.</p>
<p><b><b>Organize from the Inside Out</b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While planning the configuration of storage, think about internal organization, too. Drawers handle deep pieces like pasta pots and asparagus steamers, and you can access them with the pull of a knob. Alternatively, slide-out metal shelves will let you stow a variety of items in one super-size cabinet, but they can be less-space efficient insofar as they require you to first open a door, and then give up as much as 4 to 6 inches inside to allow for the shelves’ outer frame and rolling mechanism. Think carefully about what you want to put there and how often you need to get at it before making a decision.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Special features for versatility and efficiency</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inside your cabinets and drawers, you can add optional features that keep the contents tidy and super accessible, such as: organizational inserts for tools and knives; narrow pull out pantry shelves; slats for cookie pans and trays; and even a spring-loaded shelf that swings up and out to lift, say, a heavy mixer. And don’t let that dead space behind the corner cabinet go to waste. Many manufacturers offer Lazy Susans that spin around with the touch of a finger to access the contents on rear shelves. Look, too, for adjustable hooks to hang cookware vertically, so there’s no need to drag everything out to get to that one pesky pot. Some manufacturers offer lighting inside the cabinet box to help locate contents. If you haven’t specified internal organizing features when you ordered the cabinets, you can add them later with metal stacking shelves or hooks found at a home center.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Here’s a primer on kitchen cabinets, from custom designs to stock options</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinet construction may well end up being the&nbsp;single biggest expense of your entire renovation, and the results are the most obvious visual proof of your investment, so this can feel like a heavy decision. The challenge (and opportunity) is that your choices are endless, but if you focus on a few key factors, you can find the right cabinets for your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20751 mb-24 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="487" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br>
IKEA cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Matthew&#8217;s kitchen renovation</a>.</p>
<p>While it’s tempting to assume that your budget is the only consideration and while it’s true that custom cabinets can be (much, much) more expensive than stock cabinets, they don’t have to be.&nbsp;Even the cheapest kitchen is an enormous investment, so if budget isn’t necessarily the deciding factor, how should you decide and how can you keep your budget from dictating your choices? First, a few definitions.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color=""></a></p>
<h2>Should you go with custom or pre-fabricated cabinets?</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stock cabinets</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA</a>&nbsp;is widely considered the go-to for stock cabinets. Unlike almost anyone else, they mass-produce a system of set sizes, colors, finishes, and features that you pick and choose. The pieces of your order are pulled from stock supplies and shipped to your home, where you need to handle both the assembly and installation. IKEA keeps its costs low because they are sending your order to you in pieces and because the materials they use are very inexpensive.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pre-fabricated cabinets</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lowes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lowe’s</a>,&nbsp;and other big-box national retailers are distributors of independent lines of cabinets. They offer a semi-custom option: like IKEA, you pick and choose from set sizes, colors, finishes, and features (though national retailers tend to have more options overall). Unlike IKEA, your order is then manufactured and assembled for you so that your cabinets arrive ready for installation. Because you have more choice in materials and construction, the range of prices varies more here. You will probably pay more upfront for higher-quality materials, but you may spend less on labor because the cabinets are assembled before they get to you for installation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Custom cabinets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets are designed and constructed by hand based on your individual design. You define the sizes, materials, finishes, and features and your order is hand-crafted and delivered for installation.&nbsp;Because your choices for materials and construction are endless, the range of material and labor costs is very wide. The costs here are generally distributed between your choice of material and style, labor, and a more personalized design and customer service approach.</p>
<h3><strong>High-end, built-to-order cabinet systems</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A small group of cabinet companies also offer cabinetry systems that are extremely high-end (<a href="https://bulthaup.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulthaup</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.henrybuilt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henrybuilt</a>&nbsp;are examples). These companies are known for beautiful and durable cabinet construction and best-in-industry warranties, but the bare minimum for even&nbsp;a small kitchen can easily exceed <strong>$20,000</strong>, so unlike other categories of cabinet construction, this option is only available if the starting point for your budget allows you to consider it.</p>

Custom cabinets by Henrybuilt in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kavi and David&#8217;s kitchen</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets might be less expensive than you think if your kitchen has limited space, lots of space, or an unusual layout.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a tight kitchen, stock and pre-fabricated cabinets in standard sizes might not be worth the initial material savings because you will need more inventive labor to fit everything in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a large kitchen, extra depth or high ceilings give you an opportunity for additional storage and functionality. Non-standard cabinet heights and depths can bring value to your renovation and re-sale value. Multiple corners, awkward niches, and unusual footprints can be&nbsp;tough to outfit. Stock and pre-fab cabinets in standard sizes may force you to spend money on filler materials, wasted space, and labor for semi-custom adjustments.</p>

<h3>Custom cabinets might be worth extra money if you plan to stay for years, have kids or a high-traffic kitchen, or want personalized support.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Semi-custom and custom cabinets offer higher&nbsp;quality materials in sturdier thicknesses that last longer.&nbsp;Particle board and MDF, two common materials for stock cabinets, are susceptible to water and have a shorter life span than plywood and wood. 1/2” particle board will not last as long as 3/4” or 1” furniture-grade plywood cabinet bases, and solid wood doors and drawers will endure tougher handling over the years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets also typically use sturdier construction and joinery methods. Custom cabinetmakers will often use dovetail joints that interlock pieces of wood to distribute weight and stress more evenly, whereas stock nut, bolt, and nail methods isolate wear on a few points. They also offer options for tougher hardware elements like hinges and drawer sliders. In addition, custom cabinet makers generally provide a higher level of design support and customer assistance. They will do site visits, re-designs, and get a real person on the phone with you when you need it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You might be absolutely fine to handle the ordering and delivery of a stock system, but if you hit a roadblock, custom cabinet companies expect to support you and respond personally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Once you order the IKEA materials and you pay for assembly and installation, you’re not far off from a custom option that would last longer and provide more options – for a few extra thousand dollars, you may actually get a much better deal.&nbsp;Each time you take one of these steps up in material quality and thickness, you have a corresponding price and life span increase.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Alan<br>

IKEA cabinets with custom doors by Semihandmade in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/becky-kitchen-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Becky and Sarah&#8217;s kitchen</a>.</p>
<h3>Cost aside, pre-fabricated cabinets might work best for you if your renovation timeline is speedy or you feel overwhelmed by choice.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Custom cabinets have lengthier lead times. If you’re gearing up for a renovation in the next two months, you can get your hands on pre-fab cabinets in-store on a same-day basis, or delivered within two or three weeks. And, a perceived weakness of pre-fabricated cabinets is actually a real strength: for many homeowners, unlimited choice is not necessarily desirable. Many homeowners go with custom cabinets because they think they want options and then end up feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed. Pre-fabricated cabinets offer a pick-and-choose experience that requires less homework and decision fatigue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Many clients ask us what styles we offer and it can be hard to explain that it can be anything they imagine. Shops like ours provide personalized&nbsp;design as part of the overall service to build features for individual clients.” &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a></i></p>
<h3>Still having trouble deciding? Go for a&nbsp;hybrid!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Combining a pre-fab kitchen with custom pieces can lower your cost without compromising on quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>“Combining a pre-fab kitchen with custom pieces allows for lower cost and uniqueness. Companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.semihandmade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semihandmade</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://kokeena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kokeena</a>&nbsp;make door and drawer faces for stock cabinets so you’re not limited to IKEA’s palette.

For more modern kitchens, a matte-finish knob or pull is an easy way to customize cabinets. Repainting with a calming neutral or a bold jewel tone can refresh a kitchen without requiring demolition.</p> </div> </div>
