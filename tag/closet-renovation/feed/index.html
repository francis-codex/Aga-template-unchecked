<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49506 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MaggieAdam-bedroom-closet-17.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated closet with open doors" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MaggieAdam-bedroom-closet-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MaggieAdam-bedroom-closet-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MaggieAdam-bedroom-closet-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It wasn&#8217;t that long ago when closets were merely places we kept the stuff we weren&#8217;t using at the moment.  And all those items—clothing, shoes, or jewelry—usually turned into a jumbled mess. A mess that had to be kept behind closed doors. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not anymore. Closets have evolved from storage areas to showplaces. Having order for day-to-day activities, while having attractive, practical space is key for a well-run home. Feeling inspired by Marie Kondo or The Home Edit? Sweeten is offering some basic tips on how to remodel your closet, with details on paring down, building back up, and getting organized. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to remodel your closet: Construction options</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a few ways you can go about getting your perfect closet. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>The DIY Option</strong> &#8211; You can design your own storage system, and then look for the products to outfit the space. There are brick-and-mortar retailers and online sources for premade storage systems. You will need to do the design, take the measurements, and install the system.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Design a system with professional help</strong> &#8211; Go online and look for a company, such as <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/custom-closets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Container Store</a>, that lets you design a system with their help. They will then build your closet and send the rods, shelving, and other essential parts to you for installation. You can install it yourself, or hire someone to do it.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Use a full-service large closet company</strong> &#8211; You would deal with a local franchisee of a national firm like California Closets or Closets by Design. The designer will come to your home to help you organize your items. The designer will, with your input, create a closet design. The company&#8217;s factory will build the closet. Its installers will put it in place.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Use an independent closet company</strong> &#8211; These are local companies that provide the full-service closet experience. Some will custom build your closet. Others may source systems that will fill your needs.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Each closet company will have its own installation method.  Some closet systems are installed on the floor. But others are attached to a hanging rail that is screwed to the wall studs at the back of the closet. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Reorganize and pare down your closet</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No matter who does the actual design and installation, closet remodels consist of two parts: </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Step 1: Organize items in the closet</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Step 2: Design an efficient storage system for the closet</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This works for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all types and sizes of closets</a>, from narrow entry hall closets to large walk-ins.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For many, the initial organizing is the hardest part. Take a clothing closet, for example. Organizing begins by being adamant weeding out everything you don&#8217;t need or haven&#8217;t worn or used in years. That is often harder than it sounds, but there are ways to make it easier.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Take everything out of the closet, and start forming piles:  </span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Pile #1 is for clothes you are going to keep because you wear them on a regular basis. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Piles #2 and #3 are for the discards. One pile should be <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/a34301625/where-to-donate-clothes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clothes you will donate or give away</a>. The other pile </span><span class="s1">will be tossed in the trash because they are too damaged to give away. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the closet empty, make any improvements to the closet itself.  Clean the interior and floor of the closet. Repair any damage, add lighting if it does not exist, and give the interior a fresh coat of paint.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take the clothes you are keeping and group like items together. This will give you an idea of how much space each type of clothing will need. You will realize which items to store on hangers and which to put on shelves or in drawers. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Create a closet storage plan</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now that your possessions are assembled into items with purpose, you can store them in an efficient way. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Group like items together. Store shirts with shirts, dresses with dresses, etc.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Separate long-hanging items from short items. If you have a lot of short items, you can install two levels of hanging rods to use the space efficiently.  The double-hanging rod arrangement is one of the signatures of a custom closet.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Use drawers of different sizes and open, adjustable shelving for folded items. Flexibility is key here because you will need to store items of different sizes.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Arrange items from most used to least used. For a reach-in closet, place items you always use in the center. Place seldom-used things to the sides or on high shelves.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make use of closet accessories. You can find jewelry inserts for drawers that not only store the valuables, they also display the jewelry. There are hanging and floor-mounted shoe racks that can accommodate regular shoes as well as tall boots. Make drawers more efficient by adding dividers that separate small items like belts and rolled-up socks. Use hangers designed for ties and scarves.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Use matching accessories. To create a neat, fresh appearance, use matching hangers and storage boxes. The uniform look enhances the design of the closet.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Add extras. If you have the room, include a full-length mirror and seating in walk-in closets.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Keep a step stool handy. Having a stool or small stepladder nearby will remind you to put away hard-to-reach items. This will help keep the closet neat.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Choosing closet materials</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A closet remodel is meant to be seen as well as used. So you will have your choice of different finishes, materials, and colors. Closet companies offer a full range of products. Of course, quality finishes and materials will add to the cost, as will the size of the closet. A simple ready-made modular system for a small reach-in closet can cost under $200, plus installation. A tricked-out, customized walk-in can cost $4,000 or more. </span></p>
<h4>The closet door</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Including a new closet door enhances the experience of how you approach your closet daily. You can replace older doors with bifold doors or sliding barn doors. No matter what kind of door you use, don&#8217;t waste that valuable real estate. Additionally, you can use the back of any door for hanging items or a mirror. </span></p>

			<h2>These closet renovations set up a tidy system, from shoes and clothes to kids’ toys</h2>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-16.jpg" alt="closet renovation with three doors in master bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35239" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-16-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">A closet renovation can be designed and built into life-changing organizational tools. With the help of a general contractor or designer, smaller closets can be combined to make one large one. In addition, rearranging a room’s layout may reveal underutilized floor space that transforms into storage. These Sweeten homeowners show how they tamed the clutter and simplified their everyday.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3>A wall-to-wall closet renovation regains space (and hides a TV!)</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43436" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Toby-closet-3.gif" alt="bedroom closet renovation with sliding doors and shoe storage" width="900" height="1350" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>W<span class="s1">ith a handful of design courses under his belt, </span><span class="s1">Toby put his passion for design to good use during his home renovation. He had given away the square footage of his bedroom closet to his bathroom located in the next room. To make up for this, he designed and built a new full-length closet for clothes and shoes with sliding doors. The built-in also hid a dresser and tv.</span></p>
<h3>Adding 3 custom closets for even <em>more</em> functional space</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38719" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Barbra_closet_still2.jpg" alt="Kensington, renovation, closet" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Barbra_closet_still2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Barbra_closet_still2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Barbra_closet_still2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Barbra_closet_still2-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1">Storage was a big factor in Barbra and Sean’s apartment renovation. Closets went into one of the kids&#8217; rooms, the entryway, and the master bedroom (<em>pictured above</em>). In the master, their Sweeten contractor suggested <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combining two smaller units</a> into a single large one with a custom organization system. </span><span class="s2">“There’s a lot more functional space now,” Barbra said. “I even have some halfway empty dresser drawers. I wish I had done all the closets. Someday!”</span></p>
<h3>A toy closet renovation keeps playthings neat—and out of sight</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37994" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-15.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, nursery closet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-15-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-15-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-15-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1">This Brooklyn homeowner chose a neutral palette for her son’s room; the better choice as a backdrop for all of his colorful toys. Even toy closets can offer a visual respite and functional organization. “</span><span class="s2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/clinton-hill-experienced-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building out the closets</a> was essential to allowing us to settle in properly, and I’m glad we didn’t wait to do this (which was the original plan),” said the homeowner.</span></p>
<h3>Closets for extra shoe organization (87 pairs worth!)</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-02-04.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28034 size-chrono" title="closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-02-04.gif" alt="closet renovation ideas, custom closets, storage solutions, organization" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The standard closet build doesn’t give a lot of thought to shoe storage, so if you’re really into footwear, you’ll be faced with the problem of where to store them all. With 87 pairs of shoes in need of storage, Matthew had <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/shoe-storage-renovation-87-pairs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a custom closet designed</a> with pull-out drawers showing off a pop of orange. The drawers were each sized to his size 9 shoes and hidden behind a sleek panel door.</p>
<h3><strong>Walk-in bliss for a Brooklyn closet renovation </strong></h3>
<h3><strong><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-11-600x900.jpg" alt="small walk-in closet with door and hardwood floors and track lights after renovation" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-51189" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-11-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-11.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></strong></h3>
<p>Combining two cramped, unlit closets into one cohesive unit topped the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-crown-heights-duo-takes-on-their-bathroom-and-closet-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation to-do list</a> for Kate and Max. They wanted to increase their overall storage space and add much-needed lighting so they could access their items more easily. Their Sweeten contractor removed a wall separating the two smaller closets, keeping the closet&#8217;s main access point in their bedroom.</p>
<h3><strong>Kids&#8217; bedroom closets keep family living room clutter-free </strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36113" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08.jpg" alt="closet organization" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">With two active little boys in an 800-square-foot junior one-bedroom co-op, Courtney and Jim’s main goal was to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create more storage</a> in their sons’ room. They only requested one closet but their Sweeten contractor found space for a second closet in their room without sacrificing floor space. To keep their toys, sports items, and musical instruments from spilling into the common living areas, a thoughtful <span class="s1">organizational system was designed</span> in the existing closet.</p>
<h3><strong>Combining three small closets into two large custom units</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26426 size-chrono" title="closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" alt="closet renovation ideas, custom closets, storage solutions, organization" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A layout change that resulted in opening the kitchen to the living room gave Marissa and Cody the opportunity to demolish the three narrow closets in the main living area and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/open-kitchen-design-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build two larger ones</a>. By taking down the walls between the closets, the couple was able to increase their storage by making use of what was previously dead space between the walls.</p>
<h3><strong>A hideaway custom closet renovation mimics the luxury of a walk-in </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-05-06.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25188 size-chrono" title="closets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-05-06.gif" alt="closet renovation ideas, custom closets, storage solutions, organization" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>Michael and Chenta decided to overhaul the existing closet in their bedroom. They had a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/designers-concrete-floors-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large closet built</a> with simple, oak doors and added a floating wall in front of it. The wall separated their closet from the rest of the bedroom, giving it the feeling of a walk-in closet while still allowing the space between the wall and the closet to be used as a walkway.</p>
<h3><strong>An IKEA closet renovation with motion-sensor lights </strong></h3>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe Maggie and Adam&#8217;s bedroom closets aren&#8217;t custom. For a made-to-order look, their Sweeten contractor<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> framed the IKEA closets</a> and installed LED lighting with motion sensors so the lights would turn on when the doors opened. The brass hardware gave a final refined touch, plus tied in with the hardware elsewhere in the home.</p>

<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How much does it cost to renovate a closet? </strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">It depends if you want to do a “DIY” closet renovation, or work with a seasoned pro. A simple ready-made, modular system for a small reach-in closet can cost under $200, plus installation. A tricked-out, customized walk-in can cost $4,000 or more.</p>

<h3>A home search is serendipitous</h3>
<p>We were living in a one-bedroom apartment on the third floor for almost a year when an opportunity came knocking. Tina’s father, who used to be the superintendent in the building, heard about this apartment through the grapevine. The two-bedroom, one-bath with an eat-in kitchen on the ground floor had been occupied by the same owner for decades. The apartment hadn’t yet been listed, so we didn’t know what to expect. As we eagerly walked in, it became clear that it needed a lot of TLC.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41734 size-full" title="portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-21.jpg" alt="home remodel" width="1856" height="2784" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-21.jpg 1856w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-21-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-21-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1856px) 100vw, 1856px" /></a></p>
<p>Its dimensions were a little over 900 square feet. We saw plenty of potential, but the original layout was partitioned and closed-off. The dated 1970s finishes and dark saturated colors throughout made the space feel extremely dark and cavernous. It was certainly a fixer-upper, but we agreed it was worth taking on and jumped in feet first.</p>

<h3>A successful general contractor match</h3>
<p>Living in the same building, we could easily visit the space for measurements, planning, and the actual renovation. Enter <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>. After interviewing nearly ten lackluster contractors, we discovered Sweeten and signed up immediately. Their contractors were a godsend, very professional, and responsive. We got an estimate the same day when others would take days or just ghost us completely. And they took the time to answer all our questions and negotiate prices before they were even hired. Choosing a contractor was probably one of the most stressful and time-consuming parts of the renovation process.</p>
<h3>Planning a coastal look</h3>
<p>Our vision was to make the space airy, bright, and modern while still complementing the building’s prewar style. Tina, a designer by trade, used her skills to sketch layouts, create mood boards, and research finishes. French bistros, Vermont farmhouses, and Hampton beach bungalows were inspirations. The apartment was grounded in light neutrals with navy blue and oak wood accents for a coastal look. We loved the clean lines and texture of the shiplap, board and batten, and exposed brick. Touches of brass and Carrara marble helped warm up and elevate the space.</p>

To brighten the space further, we doused every surface with white paint and installed French doors to all the bedrooms. The carpets were removed to reveal the original 1930s hardwood floors. To our relief, the parquet still had plenty of life left in them. We went with a clear matte finish to give it a natural look and feel.</p>
<h3>More natural light in the living room</h3>
<p>The windows in the living room and spare room were recessed nearly a foot into the wall which blocked a lot of light from coming in. Exposing the brick on these walls would open things up. Our contractor built beautiful custom window frames to finish the windows off. We used a natural limestone paint to whitewash the brick for an aged look.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41698 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-13.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-13-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Bounce your wildest ideas off of the professionals; that is what they are there for.</p></blockquote>
<h3>A kitchen opens up—partially</h3>
<p>We took the plunge and opened up half the kitchen into what would become the living room—the brightest space in the apartment. It also gave back a nice chunk of square footage previously wasted with an awkwardly-curved wall. A small linen closet was removed to fit a large countertop between the kitchen and living room.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQtbfhBsVrk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>As a family that loves to entertain and cook together, we wanted a functional space with a lot of storage. Because kitchens take up a large portion of a renovation budget, we tried to be clever and save where we could. Instead of custom cabinets, we went with Ikea but purchased the cabinet doors from a company that specializes in stylish and modern cabinetry for Ikea kitchen systems.</p>

Marble tiles are more affordable than a marble slab (and a lot less maintenance). All of our state-of-the-art appliances were purchased at an outlet in Long Island where appliances were like-new floor samples. If you have the time and patience to hunt for deals, it can really save you a lot in the long run. We did splurge on the “jewelry” of the kitchen—the faucet and cabinet hardware. These little details make a huge difference.</p>

<h3>Details make a difference</h3>
<p>The bedroom with two large closets became the master bedroom. Two closets were combined into one big walk-in closet. We painted the room white and added board and batten paneling on one wall for dimension. The double french doors our contractor installed (also in the spare room) were our favorite part of the room. It gave the space a grand look and let so much natural light come through.</p>

We included some fun touches, like a brass light fixture (plus dimmer switch) and a vintage-style exposed shower body. The extra-wide medicine cabinet and custom-built vanity helped make efficient use of limited storage.</p>

<h3>Experiencing the renovation process</h3>
<p>Our contractor and his team deserve a lot of credit for their hard work and patience with us. Everybody should know that these jobs are never simple. Scheduling can get tricky.</p>
<p>Being detail-oriented and working with a contractor you can communicate with were really important to us. Our Sweeten contractor had no problem emailing back and forth about even the smallest detail. Bounce your wildest ideas off of the professionals; that is what they are there for.</p>
<p>One thing we would caution is the amount of work, if any, you decide to take on yourself. To keep the budget under control we decided to paint and do some other finishes ourselves. We saved thousands of dollars but doing all that work when we both have full-time jobs was exhausting.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41706 size-full" title="dresser" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-17.jpg" alt="dresser" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-17-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-17-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Our new home really feels like a dream come true, and we feel very fortunate to call it our own. It was no cakewalk, but we had a blast every step of the way. Coming after work and seeing the progress made was so exciting. The hope and promise of creating a space all your own, to us, is what renovations are all about. We hope our fellow renovators find it as <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rewarding of an experience</a> as we did.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Tina and Andrew, for sharing how your new home came together!</em></p>

<h3>Our minimalist vision</h3>
<p>My goal was to turn the apartment into an understated, functional, and cohesive space that wasn’t over-designed—something comfortable and cozy but tidy and calm. I’m tired of the Scandinavian look and of white floors, so I chose dark floors and hardware throughout to contrast with white walls.</p>

<p>To make things unfussy, bright, and cohesive, I used similar colors, light fixtures, and hardware. The furniture is neutral; color would come from my artwork and our eclectic accessories. Plus, I had to account for my son’s colorful toys, which would end up looking even more disruptive in a visually busy space. Building out the closets was essential to allowing us to settle in properly, and I’m glad we didn’t wait to do this (which was the original plan). We had our <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/creative-radiator-covers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radiator covers</a> custom-designed to be very minimalist so that they concealed the support legs and included a removable door that allows us to access the control.</p>
<h3>Solutions and revisions</h3>
<p>When we purchased the apartment, the wiring wasn’t up to code, so we knew we needed to replace the electrical panel. Tile floors had been covered in synthetic carpeting. There were no closet doors, few overhead lights, and a popcorn ceiling.</p>

<p>We made several changes during the process and added quite a few things to the scope of work, such as new doors, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating</a> the living room walls, and installing new closet interiors, creating space and storage. It added several thousand dollars to the job, but we are glad we did them.</p>
<h3>Opening up the kitchen</h3>
<p>The biggest part of the project was making the kitchen wider and extending it to include more storage. We wanted an open space with a large island for doing art projects and for cooking prep, and so I could see and interact with my family more.</p>

<p>We wanted the kitchen design to be invisible, minimalist, and to reflect the light and view. I spent a lot of time thinking about understated cohesion; I love the stone in the kitchen and find it calming. The stone on the island is one slab and so is the backsplash. I paid extra to have the stone vendor carry the slabs up 17 flights of stairs. It was crazy but having a seamless backsplash and island is worth it.</p>
<p>We had custom-designed cabinetry and I especially love our broom closet with a pull-out rack and an integrated outlet. Like I said, I wanted things to be functional!</p>

<h3>Bathrooms inspired by old New York</h3>
<p>The <span style="color: #333333;">bathrooms</span>, too, were designed to be functional and safe with lots of drawer storage and thermostatic controls on the shower. It’s a huge improvement from the existing controls where we had to mix the water to find the right temp. New hardware on both vanities was swapped out and added legs to the cabinets. I chose handmade Spanish white subway tiles; each tile is unique and has an interesting shape. I picked classic black-and-white tiles, shaker doors, and molding that are reminiscent of old NYC apartments. The chair rail trim adds texture.</p>

<h3>Homeowner tip: Hire an interior designer if you can</h3>
<p>The project was stressful on several levels: I designed the space and even though we’d done a renovation in a previous apartment, this job was much larger. I planned every detail and all the materials. We needed to ensure that we had enough material, which involved a tremendous amount of legwork. Additionally, I also coordinated their timely delivery and made sure we got our permits on time by getting on the phone with the expeditors, some of whom were causing unnecessary delays.</p>
<p>All of this was happening while I was working full-time and had a young child. If you can hire a designer whose aesthetic you trust to select all the materials for you, then do it!</p>

<h3>An organized general contractor</h3>
<p>We were lucky, too, that our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor was on top of things. Aleks created a project timeline, which was helpful. He was careful to check with us on all details before moving forward with work. Additionally, he also suggested a few vendors that we ended up using. The on-site foreman was excellent and communicated well with me.</p>

<p>Now that the dust has settled, though, I love my home and appreciate all the details and hard work that went into it. It’s satisfying to realize a vision and get to enjoy it as a family. We love our view, the open kitchen, the balcony, and, of course, the space is so functional! I really feel like it has everything I need.</p>
<p><em>Thank you for sharing your renovation story and the beautiful results!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How a modular closet renovation by Sweeten brought this Upper East Side couple organizational harmony</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Jacob-Closet.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31035 mb-0 size-chrono" title="work-in-progress-room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Jacob-Closet.gif" alt="work in progress in room" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When software developer Jacob first purchased his one-bedroom co-op apartment, located on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, in 2017, there were two small closets that he knew could be combined to create a larger, more functional modular closet for himself and his girlfriend, Morgane. As part of an overall refresh of the home, he walks us through the process of how he tackled this aspect of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt_Before01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30826 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt_Before01-723x482.jpg" alt="modular closet" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_JacobSachs_Apt07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />

<p><em><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you decide on the Container Store&#8217;s Elfa System? </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> I looked at some of the other options out there but based on my budget and the size of the space, <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/elfa/index.htm#?apos=MB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elfa</a> clearly made the most sense. Also, we had reached a point where the renovation was done, and within two weeks, Morgane and I would be sharing the space almost every weekend, so getting a functioning closet in quickly was a high priority.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Did you design the closet yourself using the online tool or did a representative help you in the store?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> A rep helped in the store, and everyone there was super helpful. Make sure to do a good job of measuring the space ahead of time! Once they know the dimensions, they will ask you several questions about your usage plans for the closet, your wardrobe, etc. After 20 minutes, they have a prototype to make adjustments to, although the initial blueprint was very close to the final design.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Elfa-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30936 size-chrono" title="closet blueprint" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Elfa-2-723x482.jpg" alt="modular closet" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) Jacob&#8217;s closet blueprints</p>
<p><em><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you decide what mix of elements to include (hanging space, open shelving, drawers, etc.)? </em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> The plan was to create a split usage space for me and Morgane. We would each get two hanging sections and two sets of shelves, and we would share a large section for shoes. One of Morgane&#8217;s hanging sections is double-height for hanging longer items. We have an enormous dresser in the bedroom, so we were able to consider the closet as a space almost exclusively for hanging and shelving.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What did your contractor do to prepare the space for the installation?</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Sweeten contractor</a> demo&#8217;ed and combined the existing closets. He also <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinished the floors</a> and walls of the combined space. He left the space open without doors. We used the installer provided by the Container Store’s delivery contractor. It took just a few hours.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Why did you decide to leave the doors off?</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> Before, the closet existed as two extremely small separate closets. When combined, the opening was a non-standard width for pretty much every manufacturer we looked at. There is not enough space to the side for a sliding barn door or a pocket door, and Morgane and I both find French doors or folding doors annoying to deal with. Leaving the doors off of the closet actually gave us a lot more flexibility in gaining maximum closet space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</b></span>: Combine multiple closets for more efficient storage</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: When Melissa Young first set eyes on her new apartment, she was thrilled. It was a sunlit studio space on the corner of a beautiful prewar building with plenty of windows and charm. But she knew there was a lot to be done, given that the last renovation had occurred sometime in the ‘70s. Every surface was caked with paint a quarter-inch thick (including light switches!), and the floors were badly damaged. Melissa laid out a multi-step plan as soon as she closed. Feeling overwhelmed with the number of issues, she decided to tackle a relatively simple project first—the dearth of storage—and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19335" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached out to Sweeten to be matched with contractors</a>. There were three tiny closets off the entry hall with low doorways preventing her from maximizing the vertical space available inside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>After</b></span>: With the help of her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2536" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a>, Melissa designed the largest closet doors that would fit in the space, working with California Closets to outfit the interior to create a functional, beautiful design with a mix of hanging and open shelving space. Her Sweeten contractor knocked down the wall separating two closets but left a third intact to use as a pantry space, since it was directly across from the galley kitchen. He also wired it so that her microwave and toaster oven could sit within the pantry. And although the project was intended to just focus on the closets, discussion with her contractor resulted in updates to the flooring, doors, walls, and radiators as well. In the end, Melissa’s studio had beautiful new herringbone wood floors in the hallway, refinished parquet in the main room, new baseboards, and molding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: In the process of scraping the front door, the contractor discovered that underneath a hundred years’ worth of paint was “this gorgeous metal with amazing character.” They scraped all the door frames throughout the apartment as well, uncovering the same beautiful metal patina.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;"><i>When designer, Whitney and her fiancé, Laurence, moved into their 1,000-square-foot co-op in Forest Hills, Queens, they were prepared to create a home to accommodate their newlywed lifestyle and different work schedules. First on the list: remedying a series of separate and awkward bedroom closets—one of which was within another closet (!). They sketched a walk-in closet and dressing room with better flow, re-stained their floors to a modern finish, and combined their belongings from their previous places, all with the wedding date fast approaching. They reached out to Sweeten, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and by project end, they loved the results so much, they extended the job and added to their scope.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Guest blog post by Whitney in Forest Hills, Queens</i></p>
<p>We looked at so many apartments. We stopped counting at 50. We felt discouraged after being outbid on two other apartments by all-cash buyers. But we kept coming back to this apartment. It was different than the others. It was spacious and the wide-open views, natural light, and Southern exposure were alluring. We were willing to overlook the years of wear because it had potential. Ultimately, we were seduced by the view of the Manhattan skyline. Having both lived in NYC studios for over 15 years, Laurence in Sunnyside and me on the Upper East Side, the large bedroom was certainly a plus, but the awkward closet layout was cumbersome.</p>
<p>There was a typical small closet with a simple rod and shelf configuration that had a bi-fold door that could only be opened if the bedroom door was in the closed position. A four-door, full-height mirrored built-in unit concealed the door to the small walk-in closet. In effect, there were four separate closets none of which were completely accessible to the other.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22589 size-chrono" title="closet renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-Before-02-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-Before-02 (1)" width="723" height="1085" /></p>

<p>This clumsy arrangement did not work for our lifestyle. We have different work schedules—I&#8217;m an interior designer, Laurence is a bartender in Manhattan—and are respectful not to disturb each other in the early morning or late evening. Knocking down the quirky closets to re-create one large dressing room was the best solution.</p>
<p>Careful planning and meticulous measurements of this new space still allowed for two large chests of drawers and a king-size bed in the bedroom without compromise. Our feng shui consultant advised us on our furniture plan, design and artwork placement to bring positive change, harmony and balance into our home. This was our first home together as a married couple and we wanted to honor it with good vibes. Sketched out on paper, we designed a master bedroom that felt grand and spacious. We wanted to get started right away since we had recently combined households, were living in a studio, paying for two overflowing storage units, carrying two mortgages and maintenance bills, and getting married within the month.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Even though I&#8217;m in the design industry, my go-to contacts were booked. I decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5030" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post my project</a> on Sweeten, and was lucky to find <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a> who had the level of workmanship that met my high standards. He was courteous, professional and punctual. On our first meeting, he was in the lobby waiting for our arrival. With our plan and vision, he was right in step as we discussed what was possible within our budget. Reading Sweeten&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovation cost guideline</a> helped us know what to expect and how to budget for the project.</span></p>

<p>In addition to the dressing room, our wish list included refinishing the floors, replacing the baseboard, and painting. We love the basketweave effect of the original parquet floors, but preferred dark wood floors to feel grounded on the 14th floor. Our contractor&#8217;s positive attitude brought forward creative solutions for our scope of work. While it was cost efficient to preserve the floors, he explained that they were very thin and refinishing them was a risky job. Willing to take the risk, we gave him a color wood sample to match.</p>
<p>After demolition, it was evident that some of the flooring could not be salvaged. The exact same parquet floor was sourced to replace areas in the dressing room and elsewhere in the apartment and looks seamless. He also removed a layer of linoleum in the foyer which revealed the original parquet so now the floor runs throughout, making it feel expansive.</p>
<p>Great progress was made in a short amount of time before we left for our honeymoon, and not wanting to break the momentum, our contractor sent us a text shortly on the first morning after we departed for Amagansett. (We appreciated how he staying in communication with us!) The flooring subcontractor had just mixed three custom stain samples on the floor, and they needed an answer immediately. Luckily, one of the samples was spot on, and they went straight to work. Then we received a call the next day to let us know that the floors did not come out to his satisfaction. He was going to redo them at no additional cost to us, but reiterated his concern in sanding the floors again.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22590 size-chrono" title="closet renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>We returned from our honeymoon and to our delight the floors were gorgeous! We were so happy with the walk-in closet that we asked our contractor to transform the linen and coat closets, too. He was great, the initial job came in on budget, and he advised us of the cost of change orders, billing us appropriately for the additional work we requested along the way so there were no financial surprises in the end.</p>
<p>The investment we made in the apartment and the value-added renovation has enhanced our lifestyle. If space is a luxury, a dressing room is the ultimate luxury.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re in Ditmas Park this week for an extra fun assignment! Usually, we chronicle all of the shiny new things in a New York City renovation. This week, the challenge is to figure out what stayed put in a family&#8217;s kitchen and closet upgrade. One quick look at the before and afters here might leave you thinking that this was a classic gut renovation, but a closer study reveals a more surgical project with a lot of smart design compromises that let a Ditmas Park family keep what was working and fit in a lot of extra storage and style.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="sweeten.com/kitchens/before-after-kensington-kitchen-and-closets-sweetened"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14932 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nikkiakitchenclosetv4.png" alt="closet renovation" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nikkiakitchenclosetv4.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nikkiakitchenclosetv4-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-14921"></span>Nikkia and Daniel moved into their 850 square foot two-bedroom apartment feeling grateful that the previous owners had taken care of restoring hardwood floors and putting a coat of fresh paint throughout the place. The kitchen had new cabinets and appliances, but the dark finish and heavy trim obscured the room&#8217;s natural light and the layout made key storage space inaccessible and inefficiently used. The kitchen lacked a backsplash in its high traffic stove and sink area and the previous owners had skipped on cabinetry in the windowed corner, opting for slim open storage instead. In the bedroom, two narrow adjacent closets were no match for two sets of clothes and shoes, ceding precious storage space to an unnecessary dividing wall. The family&#8217;s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3953" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten project post</a> called for giving the kitchen a more modern, light and open feel without making major architectural or construction changes and combining the two small bedroom closets into one large closet with smarter organization options. We thought <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2536" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Sweeten contractor</a> would be a great fit for the clever work that would be needed to make both spots work harder for this family.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14933" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14938" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-06" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Nikkia_Kitchen-Closet-Before-06-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sweeten contractor and his team started in the kitchen with a few targeted plans: they removed the traditional molding that added heft to the upper line of cabinets, gave the cabinets a new coat of <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-color/oc-117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Moore &#8220;Simply White&#8221; paint</a> inside and out, and swapped in more modern and sturdy hardware to complement the Shaker-style cabinet lines. They also added classic white subway tiles from <a href="https://www.homedepot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a> to wrap around the stove and sink prep space, protecting the newly white walls from cooking collateral and replaced the original sink with a sleeker, deeper, and more durable under-mount. The team replaced laminate counters in two spots with a new contemporary gray quartz and installed a more flexible Grohe single-handle sink faucet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most significant upgrade is also in some ways the most unassuming: out with the limited shelving and storage cart that never quite fit in the corner by the window, and in went expertly matched new cabinetry and counters to mimic the materials now in place on the other two sides of the kitchen. Deep <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA</a> drawer storage puts cookware within a few feet of the stove and a translucent upper cabinet displays glass and barware. The new section of countertop doubles as a mini eat-in kitchen nook with its extra overhang. Appliances and original cabinetry and floor tiles all stayed put, saving thousands of dollars and keeping the project on a much tighter timeline.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedroom, the contractor took on two tiny closets with side-by-side doors and a single row of hanging rod space, freeing up un-used space in between and adding simple improvements to every inch. Double hanging rods, open shelving, drawer storage, bright all-white materials, and interior lighting now house a wide range of wardrobe necessities with dedicated spaces for bags, shoes, a hamper, and folded clothes. The contractor re-did the door molding and hardware to make the addition look seamless and matched a new set of extra-tall 96&#8243; swing doors, minus the builder-grade insets from the previous set, for a more modern look.</p>
