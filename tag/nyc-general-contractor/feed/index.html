<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Where are you from and how long have you been an NYC contractor?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I am from Astoria, NY and have been in construction for seven years.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>How did you get into this industry?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I always bought and sold properties after renovating them. After selling my share of a business in the energy sector, I was approached by a friend to work for his construction company before starting my own.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What do you love most about what you do?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I love designing, enhancing, and seeing a satisfied customer&#8217;s face.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What is the biggest challenge about being an NYC contractor?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Dealing with things out of our control is a challenge, such as the lead times on materials and the DOB process. Sometimes the DOB makes errors leading to unexpected delays.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">There&#8217;s a misconception around not understanding the budget and the time required to complete a project. Homeowners can also carry with them the memory of a bad experience of a previous contractor who did a poor job.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Our most important attributes are transparency, managing expectations, communication, and customer service.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What’s the number one thing clients should know before starting a renovation?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Construction is far from perfect but we make up for it through our communication style and how we make adjustments when issues arise.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>If clients have questions or concerns, how would you like them to address them?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Quickly and through email, text, phone, or our job tracker application.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite project that you’ve done and why?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I renovated a brownstone in Brooklyn where the homeowners were extremely hesitant to hire us because of the cost. It was hard to win them over because of poor experiences they&#8217;ve had previously. It was a gut renovation of an entire brownstone and resulted in being a phenomenal showpiece. It was great to see how satisfied they were with their decision and how the space was completed converted.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What is one piece of advice you would give to new general contractors?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Be transparent and really know your craft before making promises that you find out later you can&#8217;t keep. This leads to mismanagement of expectations and upset customers.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite architectural structure?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Arc de Triomphe in Paris</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite NYC neighborhood?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Manhattan</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite NYC restaurant?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">11 Madison</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>If you weren’t an NYC contractor, what would you be doing?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I&#8217;d be in real estate.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A father-son team bringing renovators’ design dreams to life</h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span></i><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the experts in our network are experienced contractors and design pros we’d be thrilled to have working in our own homes.

Here, get to know their personalities and click to view their portfolio, including photos from past work and client reviews, so that you can hire the right team and renovate with confidence.</span></i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47747 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PK_Sons.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PK_Sons.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PK_Sons-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4894#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">View Paul’s (<em>right</em>) profile and portfolio</span></a>, and son, Qamil (<em>left</em>)</span></p>
<p><b>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I currently reside in Queens, NY, but I am originally from Albania. I have been in construction for 15 years, and have worked on many projects, including residential and commercial properties. </span></p>
<p><b>How did you get into the industry?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started working as a painter in 2004, and six months later I was promoted to a project manager. I continued to work as a project manager for several years. Throughout that time, the general contractors I worked with recommended that I start my own company because they recognized my talent. After considering it for some time, I finally opened my first company, PK Painting and Decorating Inc. and later became  PK &amp; Sons Home Improvement. </span></p>
<p><b>What do you love most about your job?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love talking to clients and helping them bring their dreams for their homes to fruition. It makes me happy when I see that my clients are happy with the work my team and I did</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that is the best part of the job. </span></p>
<p><b>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clients should know that my team and I are very reliable and we are on their side throughout the whole renovation process. Their comfort and happiness are my number one priority. If any surprises come up during the project, we will find a solution and won’t do anything without their consent and approval. </span></p>
<p><b>If clients have questions or concerns, how would you like them to address them?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am always available to help with any questions or concerns. Whatever it may be, I want the client to know that I am here to help them 24/7, whenever they need it. </span></p>
<p><b>What is your favorite neighborhood and where is it located?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downtown Brooklyn and Forest Hills, Queens are my two favorite neighborhoods. They are the easiest for me, work-wise and I enjoy working there.</span></p>
<p><b>What is your favorite NYC borough? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favorite borough is Queens: I’ve lived there the entire time that I have been in the U.S. Everything is so convenient and close by!</span></p>
<p><b>If you weren’t a general contractor, what would you be doing?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I wasn&#8217;t a general contractor, I would be a project manager. I love construction—I feel that it is the best field to work in and it is a skill that I love having.</span></p>

<h5><b>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I moved to the United States in 1999 after completing my military service in Israel as an officer. I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-founded my general contracting firm in 2001.</span></p>
<h5><b>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New York?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renovating your home anywhere, especially in New York City, is definitely not an easy task; even for the most seasoned pros. Here are the five biggest challenges we find:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hurrying through the planning phase: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting demolition, be certain your plans, specifications, and details are worked out in precise detail. Before any hammer hits any wall, you and your contractor should do a thorough walkthrough of the space.</span></li>
<li><b>Getting only one proposal or going with the cheapest bid: </b>You should never accept the first proposal you receive. Compare at least three different contractors. Always remember: if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
<li><b>If your project is a gut job, consider hiring an interior designer: </b>If your kitchen remodel is a full gut and includes tile, stone, cabinets, and paint, then you will benefit by hiring a designer.</li>
<li><b>Spending money in the wrong places: </b>Make the best use of your budget and reserve the largest amounts for the spaces and features you’ll use regularly. This could be a large countertop or a great cooktop. Remodel the lesser-used areas with simpler finishes like lighting and backsplashes.</li>
<li><b>Living in the apartment during the renovation, or moving back too soon: </b>You’ll have plenty of stress while overseeing your renovation, but living in the midst of it all will multiply that stress.</li>
</ul>
<h5><b>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we begin working with you, they should think about the goals they want to achieve. Is stellar design the driving force? Improved functionality? Resale? Perhaps you’re looking for energy-saving ideas? Or maybe it’s a combination of all these elements? They should also know their budget. Developing a budget range will help you make decisions when you are choosing materials and appliances.</span></p>
<h5><b>What’s the number one thing clients should know before starting a renovation? </b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As contractors, we’ve learned a lot of lessons on the do&#8217;s and don’ts of construction. The number one thing is to be a confident decision-maker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all want our remodel to move forward with as few problems as possible. Make as many decisions about your project before the work actually starts. A good contractor will always discuss a list of possible situations that might come up on your renovation project. Their project manager Nick said, &#8220;Most of the problems are usually connected to choices about small things such as faucet selection, paint, or trim.” These may seem small and unimportant when you start your project. If your faucet is two weeks late because of shipping, your plumber will have to be rescheduled.  This can balloon into a week delay on a four-week project.</span></p>
<h5><b>What is your favorite architectural building?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santiago Calatrava, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub is my all-time favorite. I love his work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it&#8217;s organic and always feels like his structures could be a skeleton for something that was once alive. </span></p>
<h5><b>What is your favorite neighborhood?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My all-time favorite neighborhood in New York is Greenwich Village. It has pre-war buildings, thriving arts and a foodie scene,.Greenwich Village was and continues to be full of cultural and artistic edge.   </span></p>
<h5><b>What is your favorite NYC borough?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manhattan, although I complain about many aspects of it, like the traffic.  However, I really feel that it’s the greatest city in the world. Despite popular attractions like Central Park or Radio City Music Hall, there is so much more to the borough. Manhattan has classic bars, charming neighborhoods, hidden green spaces, and trendy boutiques.  </span></p>
