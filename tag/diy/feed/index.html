<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="red-ladder-white-walls" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47775 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Cons-of-DIY-2.jpg" alt="red ladder and white walls in a room under renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Cons-of-DIY-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Cons-of-DIY-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Cons-of-DIY-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Fueled by enough YouTube videos, a homeowner can feel emboldened to take on anything—even a DIY renovation.</p>
<p>It’s natural to be undecided about whether you want to do that full home renovation by yourself or hire professionals. Doing it yourself can mean acting as your own project manager, or it can mean doing it all by hand (completely or partially.) In any case, the prospect of cost savings is what tempts most renovators.</p>
<p>However, there is a counter-argument—the cons of DIY. Is that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/diy-vs-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIY full home renovation</a> really in your best interests? Examining the cons of DIY isn’t a scare story or a money pit narrative. Instead, it’s a window onto the scale and complexity of DIY house renovation. Below, Sweeten outlines how to make an informed decision.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Cons of DIY: Completion time</h3>
<p>Home renovations require time and attention to make both small and key decisions. Depending on the scope, part of your home may be covered in plastic protection, or kitchens and bathrooms will be unusable. What you want is a full home renovation that operates on a compact, predictable schedule.</p>
<p>You have a life. Career, kids, relationships, friends, leisure: All of these have priority. This narrows down the amount of time that you have available to work on your house.</p>
<p>Professionals compress the schedule and complete the project much faster than if you had done it by yourself. Both parties should discuss the schedule and duration so everyone has a clear understanding and realistic expectations. Plus, they have a vested interest in finishing in an efficient manner since yours is likely one of many projects they&#8217;re completing.</p>
<h3>Keeping on schedule</h3>
<p>When you install your own laminate floor or paint your own bathroom, timing is easy. You have three or four minor milestones to hit, and it’s simple to keep them in order.</p>
<p>But when the project is as multi-layered as a full home renovation, it’s like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each project—floor, walls, windows, plumbing, and more—has its own set of milestones. Each of those projects is a milestone and must weave in with other projects. And, to make it even more interesting, you sometimes need to bounce back and forth between projects. Coordinating subcontractors within that system can get bewildering.</p>
<p>By contrast, contractors know how to keep scheduling straight; it’s their stock in trade. They’ll keep all of the projects running as consistently as possible. And they’ll seamlessly coordinate the movements of the subcontractors.</p>
<h3>Cons of DIY: Quality of work</h3>
<p>Unless you have tiled a shower before, you first need to learn how to tile a shower. The worst classroom for learning how to tile is in your own house. You do not want your house to be a test subject for your beginner tiling, wiring, flooring, or plumbing skills.</p>
<p>Professionals do this work all the time. With training, apprenticeships, and experience in the field, they have already worked out the kinks. Professionals generally turn out professional quality work.</p>
<h3>Codes and permits</h3>
<p>A vast amount of home renovation work touches on building codes and permits. Structural work, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and even water heaters require permits in most municipalities. All permit work must be done according to code. And just because you aren’t required to pull a permit for a certain project doesn’t mean that building code isn’t applicable.</p>
<p>Code-compliant work may suffer at the hands of DIYers. The pros know code and are professionally bound to turn out work that complies with the latest codes. Contractors, subcontractors, designers, and architects stay abreast of the latest changes in their field.</p>
<h3>Cons of DIY: Finding subcontractors</h3>
<p>Subcontractors are skilled tradespeople who do projects like plumbing, electrical, drywall, painting, or flooring.</p>
<p>Even if you’ve decided to DIY your home renovation by hand, you still might end up hiring pros for some projects like whole-house wiring, solid wood or engineered wood floor installation, drywall installation, tiling a shower, or blowing or rolling insulation into an attic.</p>
<p>Finding and lining up good subcontractors can be a challenge. Using a contractor can take that chore off of your plate since the contractor has ready access to a pool of trusted subs.</p>
<h3>Renovating safely</h3>
<p>Homeowners taking on full DIY home renovations risk injury in many ways. Old paint might be lead-based, or those floor tiles might have asbestos. Black mold is common in ceilings, attics, and walls. Falls—the most common type of household injury—can occur even when you are on a ladder painting crown molding.</p>
<p>When you hire professionals to do the job, they have the know-how, safety gear, and materials to keep themselves and you safe. Safety is second nature to them since their livelihood and health depend on it.</p>
<h3>Do DIY renovations really save money?</h3>
<p>One reason often mentioned for doing a DIY full home renovation is that it saves money. As long as you can keep the renovation moving and on-target, with no wasted time or materials, you just might save some money.</p>
<p>But there is also the distinct possibility that you may lose this bet. If your project isn’t clearing inspections, you need to do it over until you get it right. That costs money. If you decide to do a hands-on renovation, you may need to purchase tools that are used only once: a wet tile saw, a full set of drywall tools, a paint sprayer.</p>
<p>When you hire a professional to do your full home renovation, you might save money in a number of ways. Savings might come in the form of wholesale discounts, bulk discounts, or special perks granted by a supplier since the professional is a regular buyer. Or from years of experience, the professional may have a keen eye for finding materials that are still high-quality but less expensive.</p>
<h3>Is a DIY renovation the right choice?</h3>
<p>No solution applies to everyone in all situations. A DIY home renovation might be perfect if you are hungry to learn new skills. For anyone who is interested in the process as well as the product, DIY renovation is an eye-opener. Finally, if you are short on money but long on time, a DIY renovation might be right for you.</p>
<p>Hiring professionals to do your whole-house renovation helps you hit those critical timing marks that keep you on schedule. The work will be done to professional quality, safely and cleanly, in accordance with local building codes. Peace of mind and the assurance that the job will be done right—and not hanging over your head for months—are just a few of the benefits of using pros to do your full house renovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Wallpaper, yes. Demo, definitely not.</h2>
<p>Let’s face it: there are just some projects you can do yourself and others that need a professional. At Sweeten, a free service that matches renovators with general contractors, we take a pretty hard stance on that fact. Numbers also show that homeowners often regret taking on DIY projects. According to a survey of 2,000 Americans conducted by the online referral source <a href="https://www.improvenet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.improvenet.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553691994801000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHDtpf0X-v09gkSqsml_4gCe56mpA"><i>Improve </i>Net</a>, 63 percent regretted at least one project. One in three respondents had to call a professional to redo their botched work, too.</p>
<p>We put together a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/diy-vs-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/diy-vs-contractor/">list of projects </a>that are totally okay to DIY, like wallpaper installation, and others we recommend hiring a contractor for (demolition, plumbing work—to name a few). To see real-life examples of those ideas, check out these Sweeten remodels below, where renovators completed a few small DIY projects themselves, plus DIY jobs that ultimately led to the homeowners hiring a contractor.</p>
<h3>DIY: Painting cabinets</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21436 size-full" title="black kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="black kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">As architects, Kate and Arthur know a thing or two about renovations. When they decided to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase and remodel their very own fixer-upper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they came to Sweeten to find a contractor to reconfigure the walls, expand the kitchen, and overhaul the bathroom. The couple also decided to take on a few small projects themselves, including building out the IKEA kitchen cabinets and painting the fronts (26 panels, some over 10 feet tall). They warned potential DIYers: only take on a do-it-yourself project like this “if you have the time, patience, and space.” While it was a money-saving exercise, it took a took almost a full month to paint the cabinets, plus they had to do the work in their own apartment.</span></p>
<h3>DIY: Installing wallpaper</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32900 size-full" title="wallpapered bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-10.jpg" alt="wallpapered bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flipping the floors of a Bedford-Stuyvesant brownstone to move the rental apartment to the garden-floor was no small project. Bellamy and Zak hired a Sweeten contractor to handle the majority of the work, from exposing the brick walls to tearing down walls. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was our first time doing a serious renovation that would require </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than our DIY skills could handle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Bellamy shared. They instead put those skills to use in the first-floor bathroom, installing a peel-and-stick dotted wallpaper and black wainscoting.</span></p>
<h3>DIY: Material sourcing</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38359 size-full" title="open living area and kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-16.jpg" alt="open living area and kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-16-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Barbra-Dannov-Apt-16-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">To save on time and money, Barbra did all of her </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">own research on materials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from the kitchen appliances to the wallpaper. This was no small feat, as her family was planning a complete overhaul, including the kitchen and bathroom. “I never knew how many different types of doorknobs there were—or even realized I had strong preferences in doorknobs,” she said, “until I actually had to choose one.” That said, their contractor did give his input on where to splurge and save on materials, advising to invest in custom closets and tile, but to save on cabinetry instead of going custom.</span></p>
<h3>Hire a Contractor: for demolition, plumbing, and electrical work</h3>
<p>Just to reiterate: we do not recommend attempting any demolition, plumbing, or electrical work yourself. Rules and regulations aside, it&#8217;s also a matter of safety. Not to mention, demolition may look easy, but just think about getting all of the demolished drywall, cabinetry, and even appliances out yourself. In one Sweeten renovation, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-galley-kitchen-gets-in-line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-galley-kitchen-gets-in-line/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553780880310000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5pxgKk22rmE4VupJUutiwHeorPA">contractor had to saw through</a> the old stove and refrigerator to get them out of the kitchen! Stick with our suggestions for DIY projects and you&#8217;ll be on your way to a dream home you&#8217;ll love coming home to every day.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-ElizabethBorri-Kitch-Bath-Laundry06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31220 size-full" title="green-vanity-green-custom-shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-ElizabethBorri-Kitch-Bath-Laundry06.jpg" alt="green vanity and green custom shelves and cabinetry in a bathroom with green wall and stacked washer dryer after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-ElizabethBorri-Kitch-Bath-Laundry06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-ElizabethBorri-Kitch-Bath-Laundry06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-ElizabethBorri-Kitch-Bath-Laundry06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-ElizabethBorri-Kitch-Bath-Laundry06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-ElizabethBorri-Kitch-Bath-Laundry06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth wanted to update a half-bathroom into a bath-utility room combination. She </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/a-half-bath-remodel-in-financial-district-fixes-layout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">started the demolition herself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and then came to Sweeten to find a general contractor to complete the work when she realized figuring out how to fit everything she wanted in the room was going to be tricky. </span>Her contractor was able to find the best way to make use of the room and ended up finding extra space behind the wall that made a big difference, in addition to building custom shelves and cabinetry.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog04-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29589 size-full" title="kitchen " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog04-1.jpg" alt="kitchen " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog04-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog04-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog04-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">A series of DIY mishaps, shoddy professional work, and a leaky dishwasher (that ruined the floor) ultimately led Susan and Carl to post their kitchen renovation to Sweeten. Their Sweeten general contractor ended up completely </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-hodgepodge-of-diy-jobs-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demolishing their DIY’ed kitchen </span></a>and came up with a design plan to work around what the homeowners thought would be potential roadblocks. Whil<span style="font-weight: 400;">e the homeowners thought a beam would force them to shorten the cabinet height, their contractor “knew exactly how to notch out the back of the taller cabinets to accommodate the beam,” Susan said. </span></p>

<p>Whether for budgetary reasons or because you’d like to contribute some sweat equity to your new home, you might be tempted to take on a portion of the renovation yourself. Depending on how you rank on the handiness scale, you may be able to contribute, and you should first discuss with your general contractor what is safe for you to do. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten,</a> a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, surveyed some of its GCs to get their take on the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts of homeowner helpfulness.</p>
<h2><b>What to DIY</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sourcing materials</li>
<li>Painting</li>
<li>Updating hardware (ie. knobs, pulls)</li>
<li>Assembling modular cabinetry or closet systems</li>
<li>Hanging small fixtures (ie. towel racks, swapping out a light fixture)</li>
<li>Installing wallpaper</li>
</ul>
<h3>DO: Source materials</h3>
<p>One of the initial tasks of a renovation is to source materials. “If you&#8217;re excited about the renovation and want to participate, a major task you can help with is to select materials, fixtures, and finishes as soon as possible,&#8221; says Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill. &#8220;Collaborate with your contractor to confirm the materials you need, including the measurements and the sequence in which they should be ordered and delivered. Getting this completed is a bigger deal than it sounds, and paves the way for a successful renovation.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Walter</a> tells us that he often works with clients who like to find their own materials. “This saves time if the client already knows what they want, he says. &#8220;They can make the list and I will look it over.” In some scenarios, the clients are working with a designer, who also helps with the sourcing.</p>

<h3>DO: Easy refreshes</h3>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Matt</a> explains that good DIY projects should be inexpensive upgrades and only “require minimal tools.&#8221; “Some simple DIY projects that homeowners can do is to freshen up the room with a coat of paint, update kitchen/bathroom hardware, install wallpaper, or spruce up the front entry with greenery,” he says.</p>
<h3>DO: Paint</h3>
<p>Generally, DIY painting is a great cost-saving measure because of the large disparity between the cost of professional painting and a DIY job. This is because painting is mainly about labor—and it does require skill if your walls need a lot of prep work. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Phil</a> says that this job is a good candidate for a DIY because it’s “confined, not noisy, and relatively easy. Prep work is the hard part, so a homeowner could outsource that part and just do the painting.” Importantly, “it’s at the end of the project, you don’t hold anything up.”</p>
<h3>DO: Work that requires minimal tools</h3>
<p>If you’re a patient person with attention to detail, you can also assemble your own modular kitchen cabinets and closet systems, while outsourcing the installation to a general contractor. Many modular projects, such as those from IKEA, are geared toward homeowner assembly, so they require minimal skills and tools.  You can now find wallpaper that is installation-friendly. In general, though, you may need a second set of hands to help with this detailed-oriented task.</p>
<h2><b>What to Leave for the Pros</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Demolition</li>
<li>Plumbing or electrical work</li>
<li>Any kind of structural work</li>
<li>Skim coating</li>
<li>Tilework</li>
<li>Flooring</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, it may not be advisable for a homeowner to take on renovation projects, even if they feel capable. In many urban apartment buildings, for example, you are governed by co-op, condo, and city regulations that require a professional to undertake any contracting work. Your building will require your contractor to provide a license and insurance information to hold the firm accountable for the work being done in your home. If you do the work yourself, you could get yourself and your general contractor into trouble.</p>

<h3>DON’T: Take on demolition, plumbing, or electrical</h3>
<p>Rules and regulations aside, there is also the matter of safety. Sweeten general contractor Phil told us that he’s had clients ask to do their own demolition in the past. “It may seem easy, but actually, there’s a lot to consider,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You create a lot of garbage; how do you get it out? What if you damage something that you have to preserve? What if you get hurt in the process?” These considerations also guide our recommendation that anything structural, or involving plumbing or electricity, is best left to the professionals.</p>
<h3>DON&#8217;T: Consider skim coating</h3>
<p>Skim coating is a process that hand-applies a layer of mud used in construction over the surface of your walls and ceilings and is then smoothed by hand. General contractor Walter strongly advises against a homeowner from taking on this task. &#8220;Spackling takes a lot of skill and practice that should be left to a professional,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If done incorrectly it would ruin the finished product of the job.&#8221; Jean talks about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating here</a>.</p>
<h3>DON’T: Install flooring or tiles</h3>
<p>Flooring and tile work are other areas that homeowners often consider DIYing. Depending on the level of difficulty and your own experience with this type of work, you may attempt to take it on. But if you’ve never done it before, you may not be able to execute it properly. Any mistakes will have to be fixed by the contractor, which delays the project and costs everyone time and your money.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/clean-up-after-major-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43105 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1.jpg" alt="clean up after renovation" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>DON’T: Take on projects that may cause delay</h3>
<p>The final consideration that Sweeten contractors point out is timing. If a DIY project is something that must happen in the middle of the project and be finished before the rest of the work can continue, homeowners must complete the DIY project when they say they will. Otherwise, the entire project falls behind.</p>
<p>General contractors are responsible for scheduling their workers, as well as any subcontractors for electrical or plumbing work, to make sure everyone’s job is completed in a timely fashion. If you, as the homeowner, have not finished assembling the kitchen cabinets, they can’t be mounted, the countertops cannot go in, the backsplash cannot be installed. (You get the picture.) These delays can be very costly. For this reason, the best DIY projects tend to be those that happen at the end of a renovation (like painting!).</p>
<p>With these do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts in mind, go ahead and take on the tasks that give the professionals the space they need to keep your renovation moving along on schedule. You’ll soon be enjoying your new space with a touch of your own handiwork.</p>
